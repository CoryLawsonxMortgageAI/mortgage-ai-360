c.  Processing 
Significant 
Changes  Chapter 1 S ection 8  of the VA Lender’s Handbook  provides definitions of 
significant changes that may affect a lender’s status.  Follow these steps to process a significant change:  
Step  Action  
1 Ensure the lender has submitted sufficient information to make a 
determination on automatic authority, as well as the $100 fee.  
• Obtain any additional information needed or missing fee from the 
lender.  
• Topic  10 of this chapter explains how to process fees.  
2 If the lender operates in the jurisdiction of two or more RLC s, forward 
all relevant documentation to the RLC  with jurisdiction over the 
lender’s home office for a determination.  
3 Determine whether the lender, after undergoing the 
merger/acquisition or other significant change, continues to have 
automatic authority.  
 If the answer is yes , write a letter to the lender which includes 
recognition of the merger/acquisition or other change and establishment of: 
• The remaining entity's name , 
• The lender's authorit y (including Lender Appraisal  Processing 
Program [ LAPP ]), 
• VA lender ID n umber , 
• Principal personnel of the lender , and  
• Authorized agents.

all relevant documentation and proof of payment of the fee to CO  for 
a determination.  Go to step 4. 
 
Note :  
A change in ownership of a non- supervised automatic lender 
always extinguishes the automatic authority of the lender  unless the 
new enti ty is clearly supervised.  (Automatic authority is not for sale.)  
Submit these types of cases to CO  unless the new entity is clearly 
supervised.

a. 
Responsibility  The RLC  with jurisdiction over a lender’s home office is responsib le for 
assigning an initial ID n umber to that lender  and any subsequent branch IDs .  
Any RLC  may  assign the agent’s initial ID n umber  regardless of the  
sponsoring lender’s jurisdiction. 
 
To avoid creating a duplicate ID, search under the company name  and tax ID  
before assigning an initial ID n umber  using the chart below . 
 
Digits  Explanation  
1  
through  
6 These 6 digits are assigned by the RLC  with jurisdiction over the 
lender's home office and always  stay the same for that lender.  
• An entity which functions sometimes as a lender, and other times as an agent, uses the same 6 -digit number for both. 
• A lender w hich operates out of home and branch offices uses the 
same 6 -digit number for all locations.  
7 
and  
8  "00" represents the lender's home office.  
 
For a branch office, the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Code represents the s tate in which the branch office is 
located.  
9 
 and 
 10  "00" represents the lender's home office.  
 For a branch office, a 2 -digit branch number is assigned.  
Up to 99 branch n umbers can be established in each state.  
 
b. Agent 
Coding Issues  
 If an agent or lender has been assigned more than one ID number , the LPO  
must contact the CO Program Management & Data Integration  team  to make 
appropriate corrections to the electronic records.

record.   Central Office reserves the right to require additional training for 
lenders with persistent deficiencies.   
 
• If greater need is identified by the RLC  and/or Central Office  additional 
training may be necessary.

support the loan amount, discuss with the lender if they want to proceed.  
• If the Veteran submits a certification of intent to dispose of 
presently owned property that secures a VA loan and obtain 
restoration of entitlement, continue the review.  Note: A conditional Certificate of Commitment must be issued in such 
cases if other qualifications are met.  
3 Verify that the occupancy requirement specified in Chapter 3, Topic

b. Special 
Procedures 
for Veterans Receiving a VA Pension  If the Veteran receives a VA pension, verify income in Compensation 
Services’ electronic system of record.  
• If the electronic system of record substantiates income, proceed with

• If it is clear that the Veteran does not qualify for the loan, notify the lender and Veteran of the rejection prior to submitting the request to 
the Pension Management Center (PMC).  
• If income reported on the loan application is less tha n the income in 
the electronic system of record, continue processing and notify the PMC.  
• If income reported on the loan application is greater than the income 
in the electronic system of record, suspend processing of the loan

o Verifications of employment and deposit, 
o Pay stubs,  
o Documentation of social security benefits, pensions, and/or

c. Special 
Procedures 
for Veterans  
Rated 
“Unable to Manage VA Benefits”  Prior  to an RLC  approving a VA home loan application submitted by a lender 
for a beneficiary in the fiduciary program, an assessment must be conducted by the Fiduciary Hub to determine if the investment is prudent and in the best interest of the beneficiary.  T his assessment is required even when the spouse 
is the payee.   
 To initiate the determination process, complete and email a copy of the Fiduciary Hub Memorandum (see Topic 8 of this chapter  for a sample 
memorandum) to the Fiduciary Hub with jurisdiction ( see Topic 9 of this 
chapter ). 
 The Fiduciary Hub will return the memorandum wit hin 3- business days of 
receipt and the memorandum will be marked “Approved,” “Denied,” or “Field Examination Required.”  Please note that the Fiduciary Hub is not making an unde rwriting decision (whether the loan should be approved or 
denied).  
 If the memorandum is marked “Approved,” proceed with underwriting.  If the memorandum is marked “Denied,” inform the lender VA cannot approve the loan.  If the memorandum is marked “Field Examination Required,” inform the lender it may take as long as 120 -calendar  days for the Fiduciary Hub to make 
a determination.  
 
Real estate must be titled only in the beneficiary’s name.  Listing the fiduciary’s name on the title with the beneficiary is strictly prohibited, unless the fiduciary is a spouse payee.  There are circumstances where an individual besides a spouse may be listed on a real estate title with the beneficiary; however, these instances require review and approval by Central Office, Pension and Fiduciary Service.  The Fiduciary Hub or Activity conducting the 
assessment must submit a request to Central Office, Pension and Fiduciary Service, for instances where another individual, besides a spouse, will be 
listed on the title with the ben eficiary.

d. Special 
Procedures 
for Secondary Borrowing  If the VA -guaranteed first mortgage is submitted for prior approval:  
• Review the documentation on the second mortgage for acceptability 
of the terms of that mortgage  (see Chapter 9 , Topic  4 of the  
VA Lender’s Handbook ). 
• Include the second mortgage payment in the income and debt evaluation.  
• Contact the lende r, if the  loan approval is marginal due to the second 
mortgage payment.   
• Suggest modification of the terms of the second mortgage.  
 
Require the lender to obtain first lien position when recording the VA  
mortgage .    
  
e. Notif ication  
of Withdrawal 
or Rejection  If the lender or Veteran wishes to withdraw the application , then advise the 
lender to cancel the request in the electronic system of record . 
 If the l oan s pecialist reviews the loan and recommends rejection:  
• The Loan Production Officer (LPO) or appropriate level individual will 
personally review the file and document the decision in the electronic 
system of record , then  
• Notify the lender and borrower  in writing and telephone , and then 
document it in the electronic system of record . 
  
f. Verify 
Guaranty for Joint Loans  For joint loans involving one or more non -Veterans:  
• Limit the loan amount shown on the commitment to the 
Veteran's/Servicemember’s portion of the loan.  
• Base the percentage of guaranty on the ratio of the amount of entitlement the Veteran has available to the Veteran's portion of the loan. (See chapter 
7, Topic 2 of the VA Lender’s Handbook
).   
• Calcu late the appropriate funding fee  (FF)  amount based on Vete ran’s 
portion of the loan (see C hapter 7, Topic 2 of the VA Lender’s 
Handbook ).

g. Review 
Changes 
Occurring Between Time of Commitment and Closing  Changes in the qualifications of the loan or borrower  
 If either VA or the lender has reason to question the continued validity of the commitment based on materially significant changes,  instruct the lender to 
delay loan closing until all facts are determined.  See Chapter  5, Topic 4( e) of 
the VA Lender ’s Handbook
. 
 
Changes to the intended loan obligation

h. Cancel 
Certain Commitments 
Outstanding 6 
Months or Longer  Ensure timely cancellation of expired C ertificates of Commitment, t aking into 
consideration the 60- calendar days allowed for reporting loans.  
 
The electronic system of record  tracks Certificates of Commitment 
outstanding for 6 months or longer.  
 
Review each commitment file over 6 -months old and determine if  the 
commitment should be canceled based on the following review :  
• The validity period of the commitment has expired. 
• There is no request for extension of the validity period from the lender . 
• The FF  has been paid;  contact the lender for status  of the closing package.  
• If FF has not been paid, contact the lender to verify the status before 
canceling the commitment.  
• Notify the lender of actions taken and annotate actions in  the electronic 
record .

Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This is a new section  added to M26 -1. 
  
a. References  Refer to  Chapter 6 , Topic 2  of the VA Lender’s Handbook , IRRRL Made to 
Refinance a Delinquent Loan, for required documentation and processing 
procedures.  
  
b. Approve or 
Reject Loan  Determine the Veteran's willingness a nd abi lity to make the loan payments. 
The default on the prior loan is not a basis for withholding approval of the 
new loan in the absence of a clear indication that the Veteran lacks the willingness or abi lity to make the loan payments. However , do not approve a 
loan that would be of no real benefit to the interests of the Veteran or the Government.  
 All late payments and late charges c an be rolled into the new loan. If the 
amount of late payments and late charges is significant, the proposed monthly paym ent will be adversely impacted. Carefully analyze whether the I nterest 
Rate R eduction R efinance Loan (IRRRL)  would benefit the Veteran and not 
create unacceptable risk to the Government in light of the new monthly payment.  
Communicate  the decision to the lender  and a nnotate  the decision in the  
electronic system of record .

• This is a new section  added to M26 -1. 
   
a. Waiver of 
60-Day Limit 
for Reporting 
the Loan  The LPO or appropriate level individual is authorized to waive a lender's 
failure to report a loan within 60- calendar days of closing.  
• The lender must request the waiver in writing.  
• The request must give the reason for the late submission.  
• For automatically closed loans, the lender must certify the loan is current 
when reported.  
  
b. How to 
Issue Evidence of Guaranty  Upon receipt of  a request for manual guaranty:  
Step  Action  
1 Refer to Chapter 5 , Topic 5  of the  VA Lender’s Handbook , for a 
list of all required documents.  
2 Verify receipt of the required FF, or proof of the Veteran's exempt 
status.  
3 Verify a valid COE has been issued.  
4 Verify th at an NOV has been issued.  
5 Enter the loan into the electronic system of record  and issue the 
LGC using the information on VA Form 26 -0286 , VA Loan 
Summary Sheet .

                        _________________________________________________________ 
 
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This is a new section  added to M26 -1. 
  
a. Release of 
Liability  VA processes Release of Liabilities (ROL s) for three purposes:  
• For servicers without automatic authority when their holders lack 
automatic authority , 
• Divorce cases where the Veteran is retaining the property , and  
• Special approvals  and appeals . 
 Reference Chapter 5 , Topic 7 of the VA Lender’s Handbook
 for additional 
information relating to ROLs and Substitutions of Entitlement (SOE s). 
  
b. Servicers 
Without Automatic Authority  Servicers without automatic authority , and whose holders lack automatic 
authority , will develop and submit a complete credit package to VA .  VA will 
then act as the approving entity.  The process is similar to underwriting and making a decision on a prior a pproval loan.  
• When a request is received, create a record in the RLC  tracking system.  
• In order to process a release,  you must have the following information:  
• VA Form 26 -6381 , Application for Assumption Approval/Release 
from Personal Liability .   
• VA Form 26 -6382 , Statement of Purchaser or Owner Assuming 
Seller’s Loan.  
• A three file merged credit report pulled by the loan servicer.  
• VA Form 26 -6807 , Financial Statement , completed by the prospective 
assumer.   
• VA Form 26 -8497 , Request for Verification of Employment , or 
telephonic VOE properly completed by the loan servicer . 
• Original pay stubs, L eave & E arnings S tatement , W-2s, or tax returns 
for the prior 2 years , if self -employed , or other doc umentation as 
stated by Chapter 4 of the  VA Lender’s Handbook .  
• Retirement statements, 1099Rs, or other verification of income, if 
appropriate . 
• Leases, if appropriate.

requirements of independently verifying income, assets, etc.   
 If an SOE will take place , the following additional documents are required:  
• Either a COE or fully completed VA Form 26 -1880
, Request for a 
Certificate of Eligibility , for the assumer.  The assumer must have 
sufficient entitlement to substitute for that of the original Veteran.

The assumer must certify that the property  securing the loan wil l be 
occupied as his/her home  and this satisfies this  requirement.  
 If documents are missing, or not properly completed, then suspend the loan and hold for 30- calendar days.  Notify the lender, Veteran, and prospective 
assumer of the required items b y using the appropriate RLC -generated letter.  
If the documents are not received within the prescribed period, withdraw the request for ROL  (and SOE) , and send RLC -generated letters to the servicer, 
Veteran, and prospective  assumer .  Notate  the RLC  tracking system of this 
action.

 If the assumption is not satisfactory , then follow guidance in Chapter 5, Topic 
7 of the VA Lender’s Handbook  regarding supervisory concurrence of the 
disapproval and issue denial letters to the servicer, seller, and assumer.  
• If the denial is credit based , you must also include the name and 
address of the credit bureau that was supplied by the loan servicer in 
your letter to the purchaser.  When the reason for denial is credit 
based , this particular piece of information should not be relayed to the 
seller/Veteran, but only to the servicer and the prospective assumer.   
• The Veteran/seller can be advised of the den ial, but not the specific 
reason for the denial.   
• Make appropriate notations in your RLC ’s electronic record and the 
nationwide electronic record. 
 If the assumption is satisfactory , but documents are missing or incomplete, 
then suspend the loan and hold for 30 -calendar  days.   
• Advise the servicer of the required documents via  an RLC -generated 
letter.   
• Send copies to both the seller and the assumer  the same day .  
• Make appropriate notations in the  RLC ’s electronic record.  
 If the assumption is satisfactory  and all documents are received and  complete, 
then issue a RLC -generated letter to the lender, seller, and assumer instructing 
them to close the loan , then submit the following:  
• Evidence that the FF is paid, or that an exempt record has been 
established in  the Funding Fee Payment System  (FFPS) . 
• A copy of the signed Closing Disclosure if used.  If not used, then the 
servicer must submit evidence of all costs paid in association with the 
assumption (ROL fee, FF, recording fees, etc).

 • Legal instrument, which transfers the title and includes the 
Assumption Clause.  If the clause is not contained within the recorded 
document, then a formal Assumption Agreement would be acceptable  
(formal assumption agreements vary by servicer) . 
• Forwarding address for the seller.  
• Address for the assumer if he/she  is not going to occupy the property.  
 If all documents are not received or properly completed/ recorded , then 
suspend the loan hold for 30- calendar days, and notify the lender in writing of 
the required documents using a n RLC -generated letter, sending copies to both 
the Veteran and the assumer.    If the hold date p asses without a response from the servicer, send a follow -up 
request and hold for an additional 30- calendar days.  If the second hold date 
passes without a response from the servicer, withdraw the request and 
annotate the electronic system of record  and notify the servicer, Veteran , and 
assumer that the request has been withdrawn . 
 When all documents are received, close out the record in the  RLC ’s electronic 
record.  Send RLC -generated letters to the parties involved advising that the 
release has been compl eted, etc.   
 If an SOE is appropriate, then send the RLC -generated letter for SOE 
advising both Veterans of the restoration and usage of entitlement.  Notate changes in the nationwide electronic loan record.  
 If the request has been withdrawn, then close out your RLC ’s electronic 
record and notate such in the nationwide electronic loan record.  
 
When a judge awards property encumbered by a VA loan to a spouse , then 
the loan servicer will process the ROL  for the Veteran.  See earlier in this 
section for inst ructions regarding the normal review of  servicer processed 
releases.

b. Servicers 
Without 
Automatic Authority, 
continued When a judge awards property encumbered by a VA loan to the Veteran whose 
entitlement is associated with the loan, then VA will process the release of the 
non-retaining spouse or joint obligor .   Procedures for joint loans, for both 
Veteran/ Veteran or V eteran/non -Veteran, are described above.  
   
c. Divorce 
Cases  
 When sole ownership is involved (i.e. Veteran and spouse), then the Veteran 
is liable to VA under both subrogation and indemnity.  The spouse is liable only if the spouse signed the Note.  The Veteran is using his benefit creating the subrogation, plus the  Veteran has signed the Note creating indemnity.  
Due to the strength of VA’s stance regarding the Veteran’s obligation, we will routinely release the spouse from liability providing the following documentation is provided:   
• A devise of law (i.e. divorce decree or other document accepted by the 
state in which the divorce occurs) duly executed that provides the 
impetus for the release request.   
• A copy of the legal document that provides for the settlement of 
property.  
• A copy of a recorded legal instrument, which transfers title from the former spouse to the Veteran.  This does not need to include the 
assumption language because of the strength of VA’s position regarding the Veteran’s liability.  
• Evidence that the subject loan is current at the time of the re lease or at 
the time the request was made.  
• Written request for release from the former spouse.  This information 
must be collected  on VA Form 26 -6381
.  
 
No FF is assessed in divorce cases.  Once th e servicer is informed that VA 
has approved the ROL , they may charge a nominal fee up to $50.00 to amend 
their records to reflect the change in ownership.  
 Review the documents received.   
• If all documents are received, complete and satisfy the requirements 
then notate your RLC s electronic system of record  as to the 
completion of the release.

 • As spousal information is not initially captured in the nationwide 
system, simply notate in the notes function the spousal release has 
been completed.   
• Send a n RLC -generated letter to both the released spouse and the 
Veteran.   
 
You do not know the circumstances of the divorce; therefore, when sending letters to each party do not reveal the address of the other party.  
 If documents do not meet the re quired criteria, send an RLC -generated letter 
to each party.  Hold  the response for 30 -calendar days.  If the hold date passes 
without a response, withdraw the request, annotate the electronic system of record , and notify the Veteran  and ex -spouse that the request has been 
withdrawn.  
d. Servicer 
Processed Releases  VA loan servicers process most requests for ROLs  and all transfers of 
ownership.  The servicer is required to report these events in the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) system , as well as , report the ROLs  
in the FFPS as either a payment or exemption of the fee.  
 A monthly record of servicer processed releases is available through the VALERI system.  Servicers must provide a copy of their ROL file, including all underwriting and closing documents as described in Chapters 4 and 5 of the VA Lender ’s Handbook
, within  30-calendar days of closing the 
assumption.  RLC s should request copies of these release packages  if they 
have not received them within 90- calendar  days of the event reported in 
VALERI.  
 
RLC s may also use the reports available in FFPS to request these files.  In this 
case, RLC s may request the assumption event be first reported to VALERI, 
then follow normal RLC  follow -up procedures.

 When a servicer -processed ROL is received , the file must be reviewed to 
determine if a n SOE has been requested.   
• If an SOE is appropriate, check for the assumer’s available entitlement 
and ensure the o ccupancy requirement is met.  
• If the assumer does not have sufficient entitlement, suspend the file 
and request the appropriate information/documentation from the 
assumer.   
 
Complete a cursory review of the underwriting and ensure the following:  
• Appropriate charges (see Chapter 5, Topic 7 of the  VA Lender’s 
Handbook  for allowable charges),  
 • Receipt of the FF or creation of an exempt record , 
• Proper assumption language on legal instruments , 
• The loan is current at the time of the assumption closing , and  
• Mailing addresses for the Veteran and the assumer . 
 
If the review reveals the need for  additional information;  suspend the file, 
hold for 30 -calendar days, and send RLC -generated letters to the parties 
requesting the additional documentation.  Otherwise, code appropriately in the system of record .  Notate your RLC ’s electronic tracking system  with the 
status.   
  
e. Graduated 
Payment Mortgages (GPM)  If an ROL  or SOE  case involves a GPM and the assumption will take pla ce 
during the graduation period; obtain from the assumer the signed statement described in Chapter 7, Topic 7( h) of the  VA 
Lender's Handbook , modi fied to 
reflect the payment informatio n as of the year of assumption.

of Entitlement  The following chart explains ROE  under SOE conditions, in further detail.  
 
Issue  Explanation  
Requirements  The buyer must have sufficient available entitlement to 
replace the amount of entitlement used by the seller in

After March 1, 
1988 For loans with commitments made on or after March 1, 1988, in 
most cases, requests for ROL on loan assumptions are processed by the holder or the authorized servicing agent.  VA will process the SOE, generally after the holder has provided notice of an 
approved transfer.  
For loans with com mitments made before March 1, 1988, VA will 
process any ROLs:  
• If title was previously transferred and a n ROL was not 
obtained, the Veteran buyer's qualification from a credit 
standpoint will be determined as of the date of application for 
substitution, not when title transferred.  
• If an ROL was previously granted, the Veteran buyer is 
presumed to qualify from a credit standpoint, as long as, the 
loan is current at the time of application.

b. RLC  
Procedures  The following steps explain RLC  procedures for processing SOE  conditions 
in further detail.  
 
RLC  Proce dures  
 Applications are processed by the RLC  with jurisdiction 
over the property location. 
 
If all requirements for an SOE  have been met except 
the seller's  COE or VA Form 26 -1880  have not been 
received after reasonable attempts to obtain such, proceed 
with the substitution.  
1 Use the original loan number . 
2 Use the RLC  tracking system to track status/follow -up. 
3 Apply the underwriting procedures described in Chapter 4 
of the Lender's Handbook . Determine whether all 
requirements for ROL /SOE  are met, including whether 
the buyer (s) meet credit and income standards, if 
applicable.  If standards are met, proceed to step 4.  If  not, 
skip to step  7. 
4 Advise the seller by letter that the application has been 
approved (and the sal e may be closed, if applicable). 
Include that substitution will not be effected until a copy 
of the assumption clause (or in some states, and when title  
has already been transferred, a properly signed "Agreement Creating Liability to Holder and to the United States") has been received by VA, and a 
determination is made that the loan is current.  
5 Once the SOE is coded, send a new C OE to the buyer 
(and seller , if a 26 -1880 was received) showing the SOE 
as done.  Include a copy of the assumption agreement, 
when applicable.  
6 If not approved, notify the buyer and seller of the 
rejection of their application for SOE . Not ate the 
electronic system of record  (WebLGY) .

c. Examples of 
Substitution 
of Entitlement  
 Example 1 : Joe purchased a property from Cheryl, and assumed the VA loan.  
Cheryl had originally used $36,000 of her entitlement  to purchase the home.  
Joe wishes to substitute his entitlement for Cheryl's, but he only has $33,000 available entitlement.  No substitution can be done, and Cheryl cannot have her entitlement res tored until the loan is paid- in-full or another eligible 
Veteran assumes the loan and substitutes $36,000 entitlement. 
 
 Example 2 : Joe purchased a property from Cheryl, and assumed the VA loan.  
Cheryl had originally used $36,000 of her entitlement to purchase the home.  Joe wishes to substitute his entitlement for Cheryl's, and he has $36,000 available entitlement.  The substitution can be done and Cheryl can have her entitlement restored.  
 
Example 3: Joe and Cheryl purchased a property together  using joint 
entitlement.  Each originally used $36,000 of entitlem ent.  Joe wishes to 
substitute his entitlement for Cheryl's to release her from the loan.  Joe has enough bonus entitlement to substitute for Cheryl’s, so she can have her 
entitlement restored.

•  The M26 -1 was edited in its entirety.  
  
a. Where to 
Find 
Information  A Veteran may only pay the fees and charges specified in VA regulations in 
Title 38 CFR 36.4313 .   
 Chapter 8, in its entirety , of the VA Lender's Handbook
 provides further 
details.   
  
b. Fees 
Requiring Central Office Approval
 Fees, other than those specified in the regulations, may be paid by a Veteran, 
if the fees are proper local variances authorized by Central Office (CO).  Please check the State Fees and Charges Deviation table posted on the 
Lenders Page , to determine whether a local variance applies to a particular 
fee. 
 If a fee is not specified in the regulations, and is normally paid by the   
borrower in your Regional Loan Center’s ( RLC ) jurisdiction; is con sidered 
reasonable and customary in your RLC 's jurisdiction; and its approval would 
assist Veterans in completing loan transactions rather than serve as a detriment to Veteran/borrowers; then submit a request for authorization of the fee to CO.  This reque st should include:  
 
• An explanation of the fee  
• All pertinent facts, and  
• The impact on the Veteran.

b. Determining 
Exemption 
Status  Certificates of Eligibility (COE) issued after September 11, 2011, reflect the 
Veteran’s exemption status.   
 
If the COE does not reflect the correct exem ption status, advise the lender to 
submit VA Form 26 -8937 , Verification of VA Benefits , for processing.  
  
c. Funding Fee 
Refunds   When a Veteran or lender requests a refund of all, or a portion, of a funding 
fee, determine whether a refund is due, the amount to be refunded, and the 
party to whom it should be refunded.  
 All refund requests must be reviewed and a decision made within 10- business 
days of the initial request  date.  In the event the Veteran or lender has not 
provided all the necessary information for a determination, the system of record must be fully documented.

2 Review VA Compensation systems of record to verify 
compensation is being received  by the Veteran  and the effective 
date of the award:  
• The effective date for payment of the compensation indicated 
in VA's award letter to the Veteran is not necessarily the 
"effective date of the award."   
• If the Veteran applied for disability compensation within 1 
year from his or her date of discharge or release, the day 
following the discharge or release date will be the "effective date of the award."   
• If the Veteran applied more than 1 year after discharge or 
release, contact the Veteran Service Center to verify the 
"effective date of the award."    
• For a proposed rating, the Loan Specialist must check 
Compensation Service’s system of record to determine 
whether the rating h as already processed.  
3 Determine whether the award date is prior to the closing date.  
• If the "effective date of the award" was a date prior to loan 
closing, refund the funding fee and send approval letters to 
the Veteran and lender (see topics 3 and 4).  
• If the "effective date of the award" was after loan closing, do not refund the fee. Send a denial letter to the Veteran and the 
lender (see topics 5 and 6).

f. How to 
Process a 
Funding Fee 
Refund 
Request , 
continued  There are instances when the loan did not close and lender prematurely paid 
the funding fee.  In those instances, the Loan Specialist will follow the steps 
below. 
Steps for Processing a Request When  a Loan Did Not Close  
Step  Action  
1 Review WebLGY to verify that the lender uploaded the 
rescission document and review FFPS to verify that the lender provided specific notes within the remarks section of the refund 
request.  
2 Check WebLGY to see if the Loan Guaranty Certificate (LGC) 
has been issued.  If the LGC has been issued, then it must be reversed and detailed notes provided in WebLGY (with the case 
number).  
3 In FFPS, click the Full Refund Reason tab to “Loan Did Not 
Close.”  In the Refund Re ason box , provide a detailed description 
of the reason for the refund request and include the lender contact name, phone number, and email address; and, either approve or 
deny the refund request.  
  There are instances when the lender double/over paid or paid with an incorrect 
LIN.  In these instances , the Loan Specialist must determine if an 
over/incorrect payment  exists and then perform the necessary steps to refund. 
 
Steps for Processing a Request for Double/Overpayment  
Step  Action  
1 Review FFPS and determine the amount of overpayment or if 
there was a double payment (same LIN or different LIN).  
2 If double payment is on different LINs, then the Loan Specialist 
will go into the incorrect LIN , change the first three numbers in 
the last series  of seven numbers to 000. For example, 123- 456-7-
000891. Then complete the refund to the lender and include 
detailed notes within FFPS.  
3 If the double payment is on the same LIN, then the Loan 
Specialist will need proof from the lender (bank statement) and upload it into WebLGY.  The Loan Specialist, with Loan Production Officer approval, will create a voucher for the refund.  
DO NOT perform this refund in FFPS.  
  
Note: If there are any questions regarding the processing of 
double/overpayment refunds  with a voucher , please contact CO  for guidance  
through the Loan Policy mailbox ( LoanPolicy.vbavaco@va.gov ).

Payment with the Incorrect  LIN 
Step  Action  
1 Review FFPS and determine whether the payment amount is 
correct for that Veteran and loan type.  Be sure that no payment 
exists under the correct LIN.  
2 The Loan Specialist will go into the incorrect LIN in FFPS and 
select the “correct ” option.  
3 Change the incorrect LIN to the correct LIN, make other 
necessary corrections , and enter detailed comments in the note 
section.  
4 Once all corrections are made, the Loan Specialist can choose 
“submit the record.”  The transaction will update WebLGY so 
that the payment is reflected on the correct LIN.  
5 To correct the record of the  incorrect LIN, RLC management 
must go into the incorrect LIN in WebLGY and perform the 
“funding fee edit ” function.  
 
Note: If the payment on an incorrect LIN has an effective date of 10 years or 
more, then the RLC  must complete a voucher and document the correct LIN 
in WebLGY with detailed comment s.

f. How to 
Process a 
Funding Fee 
Refund 
Request , 
continued  When VA determines that a guaranteed loan is ineligible for guaranty, VA has 
must perform the following steps to refund the funding fee.  In this instance, 
the lender or Veteran do not need to request a refund because VA no longer has a legal right to the funds.  Additionally, VA must inform the lender and the Veteran that the loan is not guaranteed by VA and no subsequent claim will be paid on the loan.   
 
Steps to Processing a Refund for an Ineligible Loan  
Step  Action  
1 Review the notes and documentation within the ineligible loan, 
including the full file loan review in WebLGY to verify the reason for ineligibility and removing the Loan Guaranty Certificate is in compliance with VA guidelines. See the "What to do with the  Review Findings" heading in Chapter 4, Topic 1( c) 
of the M26- 1, for a better understanding of circumstances under 
which this might occur.  
2 If the loan is ineligible, process the refund in FFPS by  changing  
the Full Refund Reason tab to “Loan Did Not Clos e.”  In the 
Refund Reason box , provide a detailed description of the reason 
for the refund and create, then approve  the refund request.  
3 Send a letter to the lender and the Veteran, to explain the reason 
for rescinding the LGC. Upload a copy of the letter into 
WebLGY in the ineligible loan record.  
4 Ensure that the Veteran’s entitlement is restored . See  
“Restoration of Entitlement” in Chapter 7, Topic  10 in the M26-
1.  
 
  
g. Funding Fee 
Refund Status  In the event a lender/servicer or Veteran contacts the RLC to determine the 
status of a refund and it has been more than 7- calendar days since the 
approval, then contact the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center (ALAC) for an update.  Be sure to provide ALAC with the wire number, the date of the approval , and LIN.  ALAC will respond with the status within their 
system.  
 
In the event ALAC indicates that the refund was offset by another federal agency, the lender/servicer is responsible for providing the refund to the Veteran and providing verification (copy of the Veteran’s account with the 
principal reduction) , within 30 -calendar days .

 Dear Mr./Ms. l ast name:  
 We have received your request for a refund of the funding fee on the above -referenced loan.  
 
What We Found  
 
(Optional Paragraph)  
 A review of the information provided verified that the Veteran’s disability compensation award date was prior to the date of closing.  Therefore, he/she is exempt from paying the funding fee.    
 (Optional Paragraph)  
 
We are in receipt of information which indicates that an overpayment of the VA funding fee occurred in connection with the above -referenced loan.  The Veteran was charged a “reservist” 
funding fee in the amount of $        (2.4%); however, the eligibility was based on  “active- duty” 
service, per the Certificate of Eligibility.  Therefore, the funding fee assessed should have been $           (2.15%).  
 (Optional Paragraph)  
 
We are in receipt of information which indicates that an overpayment of the VA funding fee occurred in connection with the above -referenced loan.  The Veteran was charged a subsequent -
use funding fee percentage of 3.3%, in the amount of $            .  However, the Certificate of 
Eligibility shows that this is their first -time use of the program.  Therefore, the funding fee 
charged to the Veteran should have been $             or 2.15% of the loan amount.

 Dear Mr./Ms. l ast name:  
 We have received your request for a refund of the funding fee on the above -referenced loan, 
which closed on insert date
.   
 Any Veteran in receipt of service- connected disability compensation at the time of the loan 
closing is exempt from payment of the funding fee (38 U.S.C. 3729(c)).  The effective date of the service -connected disability compensation award must be prior to the date of loan closing to 
be eligible for a refund of the funding fee.   
 Additionally, effective October 15, 2010, The Veterans Benefits Act of 2010, extends funding fee exemption to those individuals who were in receipt of compensation, but, ei ther because they 
re-enlisted or were recalled to active- duty, a re receiving active- duty pay in -lieu-of compensation.  
 
What We Found  
 
After careful review , we are unable to authorize a refund of the funding fee.  You filed your 
claim for VA service -connected disability benefits on insert date
.  The effective date of your 
award was insert date.  The loan closed on insert date .  Unfortunately, the effective date of your 
VA disability award was after your closing date of the above -referenced loan.   Therefore, we are 
unable to approve the refund request .

 Dear Mr./Ms. l ast name:  
 We have received your request for a refund of the funding fee on the above -referenced loan, 
which closed on insert date
.   
 Any Veteran in receipt of service- connected disability compensation at the time of the loan 
closing is exempt from payment of the funding fee (38 U.S.C. 3729(c)).  The effective date of the service -connected disability compensation award must be prior to the date of loan closing to

fee exemption to those individuals who were in receipt of compensation, but, either because they re-enlisted or were recalled to active- duty, a re receiving active duty pay in- lieu-of compensation.  
 
What We Found  
 
Unfortu nately, the effective date of the Veteran’s service -connected disability compensation 
award of insert date
 is after the closing date on the above -referenced loan. Therefore, the refund 
has been disapproved.

Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This section has been updated in its entirety . 
  
a. Types of 
Reviews  There are different types of file reviews  conducted  after the loan is guaranteed, 
which  include:  
 
• Full File Loan Reviews (FFLR) including : 
 Standard Reviews,   
 Purchas e or Regular (Cash Out) Refinances ,  
 Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans (IRRRLS) and  
 Early Payment Default  (EPD) Reviews . 
 
• Special File Reviews, including: 
 Closing Disclosure  (CD)  
 
All file reviews are performed in the FFLR application  within WebLGY (VA’s 
system of record).  
  
b. File Review 
Timeliness 
Requirements  The timeliness criteria for acceptable performance for all file reviews is 
completion of the FFLR within 20- business days at least 95 percent of the time, 
on a monthly basis.

 1. Conduct a Review After Guaranty  Is Issued , Continued  
  
c. Selection 
Criteria  Conduct a file review on cases selected by the electronic system at the volume 
determined by Central Office (CO).  
 
Review  Selection Criteria  
 In addition to the random system -selection , the system will automatically 
select closed loans for which:  
 
• The Veteran's residual income is below the standard by more
 than 10 
percent; or  
• The Veteran's debt -to-income ratio is  45 percent or greater and the residual 
income does not exceed the VA standard by at least  20 percent; or  
• Loans guaranteed more than 60- calendar  days after closing.  
 
In addition to the system selected cases, R egional Loan C enter s (RLCs) may 
identify specific lenders whose loan submissions are frequently of such poor quality that a file  review (standard or special) is necessary.  
 A standard file review must be performed on loans submitted during the 1- year 
probationary period of a non-supervised lender granted automatic authority by 
VA, selected as follows:  
 
• The first 15 loans closed automatically by the lender, and  
• 50 percent of the next 50 loans. 
 
Thereafter, cases will be selected as with any other lender.  
 EPDs are performed to identify credit underwriting deficiencies by reviewing newly closed loans where six or fewer payments have been made and the loan has gone into default.  All EPDs must be fully reviewed to verify whether the lender approved a possibly egregious loan.  
 The only exceptions for EPD reviews  are cases in which:  
 
• A  standard file review was previously completed with a close -out date 
in WebLGY , or 
• A VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) system update 
error occurred.  
 
RLCs must place detailed comments in the notes section of the loan number 
within WebLGY.

c. Selection 
Criteria , 
continued  CD file reviews ar e performed  in accordance with 38 CFR 36.4313(d)(1), to 
ensure that Veterans only pay, or are charged, certain specific fees. Many of these 
fees are third party fees, i.e., collected from the Veteran by the lender on behalf of 
other parties to the transaction.  The com plete list of these fees may be found in our 
regulations, at 38 CFR 36.4313 . 
 
Upon completion of a CD review, the RLC may  determine that the review be 
escalated to a standard review.   RLC management will follow the guidance in CD 
User Instructions to internally escalate the special CD review to a standard file 
review.  
  
d. How to 
Conduct a File 
Review  Follow these steps on each loan selected for a file  review:  
 
Step  Action  
1 Verify all required documents have been submitted in the proper 
order to WebLGY.  Chapter 5 , Topic 3 of the VA Lender's 
Handbook  provides lists of documents required for different types 
of loan submissions.    
2 If the lender’s submission is incomplete or not in the proper 
stacking order, process the file as an improper submission error in 
FFLR.  
3 Review the loan file f ollowing the file review process. For more 
detail ed instructions of  the review process , please refer to 
the FFLR User Instructions  and/or CD User Instructions . 
4 For prior -approval loans, determine whether the closed loan is 
identical to the proposed loan on which the Certificate of Commitment was based. If not, determine whether the variations are allowable per Chapter 5 , Topic 4 of the VA 
Lender’s 
Handbook . 
5 For prior -approval loans on which a conditional Certificate of 
Commitment was issued, determine whether all required conditions or certifications have been satisfied or provided. 
See Chapter 5 , Topic 4  of the VA Lender’s Handbook .

 2. Review Findings  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This section has been updated in its entirety . 
  
a. What are 
Possible Review Findings?  Upon completion of the file review, the Loan Specialist will have one of the 
following determinations: 
• No negative findings/deficiencies  
• Ineligible Loan,  
• Deficiencies, and/ or 
• Egregious Loan Referral.  
 
CO tracks the determinations  listed above and will make any necessary referrals 
to the Monitoring Unit for a possible audit of the lender.  
  
b. What to do 
with an Ineligible Loan  Pursuant to  38 CFR 36.4328 (a) and 38 U .S.C. 3721 , any evidence of guaranty 
or insurance issued by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guaranty or insurance .  Once the funding fee is paid, 
the loan is considered a VA -guaranteed loan.  The only exceptions are:  
• An ineligible Veteran.  
• An ineligible loan purpose. 
• Fraud or material misrepresentation.  
 
The loan  guaranty shall never be cancel ed for the following reasons:  
• The lender cannot sell the loan to an investor or the secondary market.  
• The lender has failed to respond to non- compliant letters.  If the loan is 
ineligible based upon the noted deficiencies, then the loan guaranty shall 
be canceled.  However, if it is not an ineligible loan, then the loan must be sent through CO Front Office  for an egregious loan review  for 
possible indemnification . 
• The lender does not want the loan insured.  
 
Example s of Ineligible Loans : The Veteran is  ineligible for the home loan 
benefit ; the Veteran intends to use the loan to purchase a business property;  an 
Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan  proceeds are used to pay 
another/subordina te lien; maximum loan amount is exce eded;  Notice of Value 
(NOV) conditions affecting the basic livability of the property cannot be satisfied; the escap e clause is not in  the contract;  the loan has a term which 
exceeds the remaining economic life of the property , or 30 years and 32 days.

with an 
Ineligible Loan, 
continued
 Consult CO Loan Policy if some doubt exists as to whether the loan is eligible 
for guaranty through an email to the Loan Policy mailbox 
(LoanPolicy.VBAVACO@va.gov ).  Contact the lender by mail and telepho ne 
to try to resolve the problem.  Place detailed notes from the telephone contact in the loan records, within WebLGY , and the lender’s record within the 
Stakeholder Information Management system (SIM) . Include  the name, title , 
and telephone number of the person contacted.  
 Follow th ese steps with ineligible loans  when the lender cannot , or fails to , 
correct the problem within 30- calendar days:  
 
Step  Action  
1 Send the lender the letter in Topic 7 of this chapter, stating clearly 
that the loan is not guaranteed, VA will not pay any subsequent claim on the loan, and that  the lender should not foreclose the loan 
because of denial of guaranty and that such action could subject the lender to VA sanctions, signed by the L oan P roduction O fficer 
(LPO) . 
2 Refund th e VA funding fee, if paid (see “Refunding 
Overpayments to the Veteran” in Chapter 8, Topic 8(j) of the 
VA Lender’s Handbook ). 
3 Restore the Veteran’s entitlement for the loan following the steps 
in M26 -1, Chapter 7, Topic 10.  
4 The LPO or A ssistant Loan Production Officer (ALPO)  must code 
the loan as a canceled loan in the VA system of record and provide a thorough explanation in the notes section of the loan, within WebLGY.  Additionally, documentation from the lender must be 
uploaded into the correspondence section of the loan file. 
5 Send the Veteran a letter explaining why he or she does not have a 
VA-guaranteed loan and upload a copy of the letter into the loan 
file.  The RLC must use the letter in Topic 6 of this chapter and 
the letter must be signed by the LPO.  
 
Once the guaranty is canceled, the ineligible loan is n o longer a VA -guaranteed 
loan.

 2. Review Findings , Continued  
  
c. What to do 
with Fraud or Deficiencies  Consider sanctions against a lender who attempts to accelerate the loan, 
particularly if the ineligibility of the loan was due to the lender's error.  
 
Evidence exists that fraud or material misrepresentation may have 
occurred  
 
• Request additional information necessary to make a preliminary assessment 
of whether fraud or material misrepresentation may have occurred.  Take 
care not to alert the parties responsible for the possible fraud or misrepresentation that they are under investigation.  
• If, after receipt of any additional information requested, it appears that fraud 
or material misrepresentation may have occurred, forward a detailed request 
for investigation to IG.  
 Deficiencies Found through the FFLR Process  
 
• Request any supplementary information or documentation that is essential to 
a proper determination as to:  
• Whether the loan meets statutory credit and /or income requirements, 
• Whether only allowable closing costs were charged to the Veteran, or  
• Whether other statutory or regulatory requirements were met.   
 
If these efforts fail to resolve the problem(s) after 60- calendar days  from the 
initial file review  complete date , review for non -compliance .

c. What to do 
with Fraud or 
Deficiencies , 
continued  Review the situation and actions already completed with the ALPO  or higher 
authority  if necessary . Ensure the following has been done prior to sending the 
letter for persistent non -compliance : 
 
• Must m ake an effort to correct systemic problems.  
• If problems appear to be local, contact lender management and discuss 
concerns about the lender’s process or problems and determine if further 
intervention is necessary.  
• As determined by RLC management, o ffer assistance by providing training 
at the RLC , the lender's office, or through other electronic media.  
 The Loan Specialist must f ully document WebLGY with:  
• Actions taken by the Loan Specialist , 
• Facts concerning the lender's willingness to correct deficiencies . 
  
d. How to 
Handle Non -
Compliant Lenders  The Loan Specialist must  send the system generated  non-compliant letter that is 
created in WebLGY, for this purpose. The letter must be sent if the lender has not responded to the second deficiency letter.  If no lender response to the non-compliant letter  the LPO/ALPO must send the letter for persi stent non-
compliance, in Topic 5, to the lender’s senior level management 30-  to 60-
calendar days after the non- compliant letter . 
 
Note: Non -compliance for not receiving the loan file for review will be handled 
by CO.

e. What to do 
with Egregious Findings
 If, after all attempts have been made to obtain additional documentation as 
noted above  or the documentation provided does not resolve the issue , the 
lender has still not resolved the significant deficiencies regarding income and/or credit, determine whether the deficiencies are serious enough to consider the loan egregious .  To be egregious , you must determine that the lender flagrantly 
disregarded VA ’s credit underwriting standards.  For example, the lender used 
income, but did not provide any docume ntation to support that income, or the 
lender considered the Veteran a good credit risk when the credit report clearly showed that the credit accounts were derogatory.    
 When deficiencies are not specific to egregious underwriting or an ineligible loan, and the lender fails to cure the deficiencies, the RLC will follow the steps listed in Topic 2(d) of this chapter.  Examples of items that are not egregious, include , but are not limited to , NOV items that do not affect the eligibility of 
the loan .  
 After determining that the loan should be considered as an egregious loan, forward the case to the LPO , ALPO , or higher authority for a second review.  If 
the LPO, ALPO , or higher authority is in agreement that the loan is egregious, 
follow the steps indicated below:  
 
Step  Action  
1 Ensure that all support ing documentation of the review  and 
response (s) by the lender are uploaded into the correspondence 
section of the loan in WebLGY.  
2 Draft a memo to the Director of Loan Guaranty Service, signed by 
the RLC Loan Guaranty Officer that  provides justification for the 
referred egre gious loan.  
3 Email the signed memo to the main LGY mailbox 
(LGY.VBACO@va.gov ) with “ Potential Egregious Loan” in the 
subject line. 
  
CO will make a determination whether indemnification is warranted, and 
provide a  written response  to be sent to the RLC  within 60- calendar days .  In 
the event the loan is determined to be egregious, CO will flag WebLGY  and 
send a memo with the indemnification agreement to the RLC .  The RLC must 
send a letter and the two indemnification agreements to the lender, for signature.  Copies of a s ample letter and an indemnification agreement are in 
Topics 8 and 9.

 3. RLC Procedures for Ordering Credit Reports  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This section has been updated in its entirety . 
  
a. General 
Credit Report Requirements  RLCs may contract with a credit reporting agency , or with ag encies, to obtain 
credit  reports.  
 Generally, "in -file" credit report(s) obtained through this method will satisfy 
most RLC  objectives.  An “in -file” credit report is computer -generated and 
contains credit and legal information from one of the main credit bureaus.  
 In certain cases, a full credit report will be needed.  The credi t report must be 
ordered using procedures  that the LPO has established based upon the contract 
that RLC has in place . 
 
Costs of establishing and maintaining any such service must be paid for out of 
RLC funds.  
  
b. Uses for the 
Credit Reports Obtained  Uses for the  credit reports may include:  
• Review of questionable original credit report used by the lender  (potentially 
egregious loan and/or EPD ). 
• Credit underwriting on release of liability and substitution  of entitlement 
requests.  
• Additional  scrutiny of questionable prior -approval applications. 
• Native American Direct loans.  
 
Do not use the in- file credit report as a sole basis for rejection -  clarify 
inconsistencies with the lender.  
  
c. Safeguard 
the Interests of Applicants  Obtain a written agreement with the credit -reporting agency that it will comply 
with the Fair Credit Reporting Act .  The Act contains provisions which ensure a 
consumer has access to their credit information and the right to dispute any such information. 
 
Refer applicant complaints of  Fair Credit Reporting Act violations by credit 
reporting agencies to the Federal Trad e Commission.

following these procedures:  
• Investigate all credit inquiries that cannot be verified as having been 
requested for an authorized purpose.  
• Ensure that billings for credit inquiries are checked against a master record to verify that the inquir ies were for a legitimate purpose.  
 
Ensure that a different employee, other than the one who initiated the inquiry, 
approves payment for the inquiry.

are such that they compromise the guaranty of the loan and must be addressed.  A lender’s failure, either one -time or on a repetitive basis, to show that loans meet VA requirements could result in 
any of the following:  
 
• VA may suspend random sampling reviews and require that all loans closed by a lender be 
submitted to VA for full review.  
• VA may suspend a lender’s automatic authority and require that all loans be submitted on a  
prior -approval basis.  
• VA may require the lender to indemnify VA a gainst loss on a loan. 
• VA may determine that a loan is ineligible for guaranty.  
• VA may impose other administrative sanctions, such as suspending the ability to perform 
functions within WebLGY  
 
What Should You Do?  
 
We are requesting that you respond, by uploading in to WebLGY, the necessary information previously  requested within 30- calendar days  from this notice .  If the response is not received,

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT  
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), pursuant to the authority at 38 U.S.C. 3720(a) , 
and Lender agree as follows:  
 1.  Lender 
agrees to indemnify VA for losses, which have or may be incurred on the following loans, if the loans or subsequent VA 
interest rate reduction refinancing loans go into default, as defined in 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 , within five years of the date of guaranty:  
         Lender :  Lender Number  VA LIN xx -xx-x-xxxxxxx, Veteran Name  
 
 
Indemnification shall be made in accordance with the following terms:  
  (a) Where, as of the date of signing of an Indemnification Agreement (Agreement), a claim under guaranty has not been submitted to VA, the property will not be conveyed to VA and no claim under guaranty shall be submitted 
by Lender
.  All VA requirements for se rvicing and payment of loan fees will be observed in respect to such 
mortgage.  In the event of a claim under guaranty from a transferee of a mortgage covered by this Agreement, 
indemnification will be in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c), whichever app lies. 
 
 (b) Where a VA guaranty claim is pending or has been paid in full and the property is owned by VA, conveyance 
of the property will be accepted by Movement Lender and indemnification will be made to VA for its 
investment.  VA's investment includes, but is not limited to:  the amount VA paid to the holder when the holder 
conveyed the property to VA; the full amount of the guaranty claim; all taxes and assessments; all maintenance 
and operating expenses, including costs of rehabilitation and preservati on; and all sales expenses, where 
applicable.  In the event VA does not convey the property to Lender , VA's loss will be calculated in accordance 
with paragraph (c).  
  (c) Where a VA guaranty claim has been paid in full and the property has been sold by VA  to a third party, the 
amount of indemnification is VA's investment as defined in paragraph (b), minus the sales price of the 
property.  
 
 (d) In the event that VA determines that reimbursement is due from Lender 
under the terms of this Agreement, VA 
shall make a demand upon Lender by certified mail, return receipt requested.  Lender shall then have 30 days 
from the date such demand was mailed to remit such sum to VA in full.  If full payment is not received within such time frame, 
Lender shall also be liable for interest on any unpaid balance from the date of mailing of VA’s 
demand until the date the payment is received by VA.  Interest shall be at the rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to se ction 11 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. § 3717) representing the 
Current Value of Funds Rate used in assessing interest on debts due to the United States.

fixed period up to 12 months  (
2 C.F.R. 
801.1110 ). 
 
Do Sanctions Against a 
Veteran Impact Use of Entitlement?  A Veteran subject to a 
debarment or suspension as a program participant (i.e., lender, bui lder, 
etc.) can still use his or her entitlement to 
obtain a VA home loan.  A Veteran subject to an 
LDP as a program participant (i.e., builder, broker, etc.) can still use his or her entitlement to obtain a VA home loan.

• This section has been updated in its entirety.  
  
a. Standards 
of Evidence An LDP sanction must be supported by facts and adequate evidence.  Adequate 
evidence means information sufficient to support the reasonable belief that a 
particular act or omission has occurred (2 C.F.R.  180.900). 
• It must not be based on unsubstantiated rumors, suspicion, or 
allegations.  
• Such evidence can be introduced into the record of the hearing and 
accorded such weight and consideration, as the circumstances warrant.  
• In some cases, secondary or hearsay evidence, signed written 
statements, etc., may be the only evidence available on some po ints.  
  
b. Inspector 
General (IG) 
and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Reports May Not be Used as Evidence IG and FBI reports may not be introduced as evidence since they are 
confidential because:  
• The source of information in such reports may not be  revealed.   
• Information in such reports may only be presented to the hearing board 
through an independent medium; i.e., by means of witnesses, 
documents, records, etc.  
• Unverified memoranda of interviews contained in investigative reports 
may not be introduced as evidence.  
 
Exception : Allegations contained in such memoranda may be introduced into 
the record by direct examination of either the person interviewed or the investigator that conducted the interview when appearing as a witness at the 
hearing.

c. Provide 
Participant s 
the 
Opportunity to Avoid Sanctions  Notify the participant in writing that sanctions are being considered and provide 
the opportunity to correct problems where possible. 
 Does not  apply to cases involving fraud or criminal activity.  
 Example : Builder Construction Deficiency. (See M26- 2
). 
• A Veteran reports that after the RLC  notified the builder of a construction 
deficiency complaint, the builder did not correct the problem or refuses to 
cooperate.  
• If the facts warrant, based on a field review of the property, notify the 
builder in writing that sanctions are being considered. Include the builder's 
option to submit documentati on or visit the RLC  to dispute the complaint. 
• If the builder fails to successfully dispute the complaint or correct the 
deficiencies determined by VA to be the builder's responsibility after 
reasonable opportunity, advise the builder by registered or certi fied mail 
that, unless satisfactory arrangements are made with the RLC  by a specific 
date, sanctions will be imposed. 
• If arrangements are not made by the builder by the specified date, impose or recommend sanctions.  
 
Example : Excluded Individual Employed b y Lender.   
• An RLC  learns that a debarred or suspended individual is employed by a 
lender.   
• No party who employs  a debarred individual may continue to conduct 
government business.   
• Consult Loan Policy prior to contacting the lender. 
• With CO concurrence, notify the lender that the individual has been 
debarred or suspended by VA and may not be employed until the sanction is 
lifted. Include a warning that continued employment of the individual in 
such capacity could result in sanctions a gainst the lender. Provide  the lender 
an opportunity to discuss the matter with the RLC . 
• If the lender still employs the individual after a reasonable opportunity to 
terminate, advise the lender by registered or certified mail that, unless 
employment is te rminated by a specific date, sanctions will be imposed.  
• If the lender doesn't correct the problem by the specified date, report the 
facts to CO with a recommendation concerning suspension or debarment .

d. Investigate 
and Assemble 
Facts and Evidence Sanctions can have severe economic consequences on program participants.  
Sound judgme nt is essential when choosing to use this option.   
 Develop sufficient facts and evidence as described in Topic 3(f) of this c hapter . 
 Complete an investigation of the facts before recommending or imposing a sanction except when either:  
• Evidence accumulat ed from ongoing RLC business is adequate and;  
• The sanction will be a reciprocal action based on a like -sanction by another 
office with in VA or another federal agency;  or 
• An investigation was already performed by VA IG or another agency, 
another office within VA, or a law enforcement agency, and there is 
adequate admissible evidence from that investigation. 
  RLCs are encouraged to consult with CO Loan Policy during any investigation regarding the development of facts and evidence . An RLC  investigation may be 
performed either to provide full support for a sanction or supplement evidence from an investigative report by the IG or other source.  
  
For each relevant finding, document:  
• Source of information, 
• Investigative activities performed,  and 
• Results.   
 
Include:  
• Dates of interviews, inspections, and other investigative activities, 
• Observations made,  
• Identity of alleged violators, victims , and possible witnesses,  
• How to contact these parties in the future,  
• Relevant conversations with or s tatements by these parties, and  
• Photographic evidence or copies of records or correspondence pertaining to 
the alleged conduct , when relevant . 
 
For sanctions based on allegations of fraud or other criminal activity, see the "Fraud and Other Criminal Activity" heading in Topic 3(f) of this c hapter for

• Letters, memoranda, notes, and reports of contact, etc., related to the 
fraudulent or criminal conduct ; and  
• A request that the IG provide the RLC  with a report containing evidence 
admissible in an administrative hearing which may sustain imposition of 
sanctions. 
 
Provide a copy of the referral to CO  Loan Policy .  Verbal referrals may be 
made in unusual situations requirin g immediate action.  Confirm in writing, as 
soon as possible, thereafter.    
 
A sanction based on allegations of fraud or other criminal activity may be imposed either before or after referral to and investigation by the IG or appropriate law enforcement agency, as long as the evidence is adequate to 
support the action.

• The conduct involved is based on causes outlined in 2 C .F.R. 801.1105  and 
of a level of seriousness commensurate with this type of sanction.  
 An LDP can be the sole sanction against a participant or a means to immediately end unacceptable conduct while more severe sanctions are considered.  A n RLC  can recommend suspension or debarment in conjunction 
with imposing an LDP.  
If the LDP is against a builder, consider including any exceptions to the LDP necessary to prevent substantial harm to Veterans who have already contracted 
for the purchase of homes from the builder .

LDP, I f 
Appropriate,

LDP solely on the basis of its affiliation.  The affiliate may be included for the 
following reason(s):  
• No knowledge of, or participation in, the acts committed is necessary.  
• The affiliate has the burden of proving it can meet VA requirements and is a 
responsible entity not controlled directly or indirectly by the participant 
receiving the LDP.  
• The right to request in writing, within 30- business days of receipt of the 
notice, a conference.  
• The right to have a conference held within 10- business days of receipt of 
the request  (2 C.F.R. 801.1111 ). 
 If no conference is requested within 30- business days, the participant has no 
right to a formal hearing.  Advise CO Loan Policy that an LDP has been imposed.  If a conference is requested within 30 -business days, arrange the conference.  
• The RLC  Director may designate another official to cond uct the conference.   
• Formal rules of procedure do not apply.  
• The participant may be represented by General Counsel . 
• The participant may present all relevant information and materials.  
 The official sends the written decision to the participant within 20- business 
days, after the conference.  
• The decision will be to withdraw, modify , or affirm the LDP.  
• If the decision is to affirm all or part of the remaining period of the LDP, advise the participant of the right to request a formal hearing in writing to the Under Secretary for Benefits within 30- business days of receipt from the 
notice of the decision. 
 Send a copy of any notice of an affirmative decision to CO Loan Policy.  
 
The RLC  Director may terminate an LDP prior to the expiration of a fixed -
period LDP where the cause for the LDP is resolved.

g. Impose 
LDP, I f 
Appropriate,  
continued Before imposing an LDP against an interstate participant operating in areas 
beyond your RLC 's jurisdiction: 
• Contact all RLC s serving jurisdictions in which the participant operates to 
find out whether:  
• They have experienced problems with the participant, and  
• They wish to impose sanctions against the participant in their 
jurisdictions and to what extent.   
• Obtain concurrence of CO on chosen course of action.   
• Coordinate the contents of the LDP notices between all affected RLC s.   
 
An RLC  may implement an LDP to a greater or lesser degree within its 
jurisdiction than another RLC , or choose not to take action when another RLC  
does.  
Ensure that the reasons for the difference in treatment are supported by adequate documentation of all relevant facts, including any differences in the 
participant's activities in each jurisdiction.  
  
h. Arrange 
Formal Hearing  If a participant against whom debarment, suspension, or an LDP is imposed 
requests a formal hearing, CO Loan Policy may first encourage the participant to have an informal meeting with the RLC  to resolve the issues.  Make every 
effort toward informal resol ution to avoid the time and cost of a formal hearing.  
  
If informal means of resolution become exhausted, arrange a hearing date, in 
consultation with CO Loan Policy.

• Participant requests postponement and presents a reasonable basis, or  
• VA requires additional time to conclude its investigations, or  
• The case has been, or is being, referred by the IG to a U.S. Attorney or the Department of Justice for consideration of criminal prosecution, or criminal 
prosecution has been initiated, but has not been concluded.  
 
If there is a criminal case pending, a hearing date will not be determined until the criminal prosec ution is concluded or the U.S. A ttorney or Department of 
Justice has no objection to the hearing.  
 If the U.S. A ttorney or Department of Justice objects to the hearing, General 
Counsel  will report the facts through RLC  management to CO Loan Policy, 
which will determine whether to grant the hearing.  
  Arrange a hearing date satisfactory to the participant.  
• Generally to take place at the RLC  and to begin on a Tuesday or 
Wednesday, not immediately preceding or following a holiday.  
• Promptly advise CO Loan Policy of the hearing date.  
 
The Under Secretary for Benefits, with the assistance of Loan Guaranty 
Service, will appoint members to the hearing board and arrange for their attendance at the hearing.    
Prompt notice should be given to all parties concerned, including board 
members, whenever any change in the hearing date is made.

 5. Reciprocal Actions Based on other Federal Agency 
Sanctions  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This section has been updated in its entirety.  
  
a. Policy  Government -wide suspensions and debarments by any Federal agency included 
in GSA's SAM  are recognized by VA.   
• No reciprocal action or notice from VA is needed.  
• The participant is automatically  excluded from the VA Home Loan 
program.  
 
RLC s have discretionary authority to impose reciprocal LDPs by giving notice 
to the participant.  VA pol icy is to impose LDPs based on LDPs by HUD/FHA 
(or the  U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA]) without looking into the facts 
of the case and terminate LDPs only when furnished satisfactory evidence of 
reinstatement by such agency.  
 
The RLC  may decline to impose an LDP if the participant's record of 
performance in the VA Home Loan program warrants, and the sanction would not be in the best interest of Veterans or VA.   
 
CO takes any necessary reciprocal action against program participants based on 
HUD withdrawal of mortgagee approval, or other sanctions besides government -wide suspensions, debarments , and LDPs.  Forward any 
notifications of such sanctions to CO.  
  
b. Procedure 
for Reciprocal Actions  VA learns of HUD /FHA or USDA  sanctions by w ay of:  
• A copy of the HUD/FHA  or USDA letter to the participant, or  
• HUD's or USDA’s list of LDPs and supplements to the list.

Sanctions , Continued  
  
b. Procedure 
for Reciprocal 
Actions,  
continued Upon learning of a HUD /FHA  (or USDA) sanction, send a notice to the 
excluded firm or individual explaining that VA is recognizing HUD/FHA's (or USDA's) LDP, with a copy to CO. Include in the notice:   
• The impact of the sanction , 
• Programs or activities the participant is excluded from, 
• The geographic area affected , and  
• A statement that the VA sanction will be in effect until the HUD/FHA (or USDA) sanction has been rescinded.  
 Generally, implement the V A LDP to the same degree
 as the HUD/FHA (or 
USDA) LDP, and no further.  In such cases, VA will not afford the participant a hearing since any appeal rights are to be exercised with HUD/FHA (or USDA).  
 However, the RLC  may use its discretion to implement the LDP to a greater or 
lesser degree than HUD/FHA (or USDA), or to not impose an LDP. For example:  
• VA may exclude the participant from a smaller or larger geographic area 
than HUD/FHA.  
• VA may allow the participant limited participation in the program.  
 
If VA chooses to impose sanctions materially more restrictive than the HUD/FHA (or USDA) action:  
• The grounds for the additional restrictions must be well documented.  
• The participant must be afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the 
additional restrictions.

c. Multi -
Jurisdictional 
Participants  Before imposing a reciprocal LDP a gainst an interstate participant operating in 
areas beyond your RLC 's jurisdiction:  
• Contact all RLC s serving jurisdictions in which the participant operates to 
find out whether:  
• They have experienced problems with the participant.  
• They wish to impose sanctions against the participant in their 
jurisdictions and to what extent.  
• Obtain concurrence from CO only if the LDP will be materially more restrictive than the HUD/FHA (or USDA) LDP for any or all affected VA jurisdictions.  
• Hearing rights are required  for a more restrictive sanction than HUD/FHA 
(or USDA).   
• Coordinate the contents of LDP notices between all affected RLC s. 
 The RLC  may implement a reciprocal LDP to a greater or lesser degree within 
its jurisdiction than another RLC , or choose not to ta ke action when another 
RLC  does.  
 
Ensure the reasons for the difference in treatment are supported by adequate documentation of all relevant facts, including any differences in the 
participant's activities in each jurisdiction.  
  
d. Do Not 
Accept Submissi ons 
from Excluded Parties  Return any submission received from a participant on the GSA SAM  or HUD 
excluded list to the participant.  
 Advise the participant that VA is refusing to take action on the case because of sanctions imposed by another Federal agency.  
 If notification of a VA reciprocal action is required, as for an LDP, and has not previously been sent to the participant, send the notice in conjunction with return of the submitted material.  
  
VA will honor commitments issued prior to impositio n of the HUD/FHA or 
USDA sanction.

 6. Withdrawal of Lender’s Automatic Processing Authority - 
Preliminary Actions  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This section has been updated in its entirety.  
  
a. Be Familiar 
with the 
Regulations  The regulations at 38 C .F.R. 36.4353  provide:  
• Criteria for withdrawal of automatic authority for supervised or non-
supervi sed lenders for various periods of time ranging from 60 -calendar  
days to 3 years.  
• That automatic authority can be withdrawn upon 30- calendar  days' notice.  
• That automatic authority may be withdrawn for imprudent lending practices or practices prejudicial to  the interests of Veterans or the g overnment.  
• These practices are of a lesser degree than would warrant complete 
debarment or suspension.  
  
b. Work with 
the Lender If information casts doubt on the conformity of the lender's credit practices to 
the purposes of the law, spot check or audit the lender's credit underwriting 
practices. Options include:  
• Request submission of substantiating credit data in selected cases, or  
• Obtain backup credit reports. 
 If the lender's underwriting shows a pattern of clo sing loans not meeting VA's 
credit requirements or standards, bring it to the attention of the lender's liaison employee (non- supervised lender) or other appropriate officials in an effort to 
improve future performance.  Participation of the Loan Guaranty Officer is 
required in such cases to assure the tone of the discussion is helpful and provides guidance.  
 
If after a reasonable period the lender fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance with  numerous significant underwriting errors and/or recurring 
deficiencies , consider requiring prior approval for all future loans.  Lenders 
with automatic authority withdrawn may still process  VA- guaranteed loans on a 
prior -approval basis.

b. Withdrawal 
for 60 days  Automatic authority may be withdrawn for 60 -calendar days based on:

 12. Sanctions Based on Unfair Contract Provisions or 
Marketing Practices  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  
• This section has been updated in its entirety.  
  
a. Sanctions 
Available  VA may refuse to appraise property for VA -guaranteed financing (i.e., impose 
sanctions) if the parties in interest are identified with previous sales involving 
VA-guaranteed financing and the contract of sale or methods or practices 
pursued in the marketing of such propert ies were unfair, unethical, or 
prejudicial to the Veteran  purchasers.  
 Whenever appropriate, provide a reasonable opportunity for the builder or other program participant to correct the problem(s) prior to imposing sanctions.  Impose or recommend debarment , suspension, or an LDP (subject to their 
specific rules and limitations) where there has been a general or continued employment of unfair contractual practices or sales methods accompanied by a disregard for the consequences to the purchasers.  
 
These sanctions may also be appropriate where special factors such as an attempt to defraud VA, the Veteran, or the lender, or a substantial financial injury to the Veteran, which the seller has not remedied, accompany an unfair 
contractual feature or sales method.  
  
b. Review of 
Sales Contracts  Lenders are required to review the provisions of each sales contract or purchase 
agreement on a proposed construction case and determine whether it is acceptable and does not contain unfair contractual provisions.  The closing of 
the loan denotes the lender has determined the contract is acceptable.

Contract Provisions or Features  Unfair contract provisions or features include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
 
Example  Unfair Contract Provisions or Features  
1 Provisions allowing the downpayment or earnest money of the 
purchaser to be forfeited or retained as liquidated damages if the 
purchaser cannot obtain VA financing.  
2 Inclusion in a lump -sum contract of an "escalator clause" which 
obligates the purchaser to pay a higher price in the event of increased costs for labor, material, or other it ems prior to delivery 
of title .  
 
Unless accompanied by a provision which gives the  purchaser the 
option of canceling the contract and obtaining a refund of the monies paid if the increased price  is not acceptable to the 
Veteran.  
3 Provisions which infrin ge upon the usual or customary freedom 
or right of an owner to sell a property, except as allowed under 
38 C .F.R. 36.4309( e) and 36.4354(b)(5) . 
 
Example . A provision that the purchaser will give a stated real 
estate agency an exclusive listing if he or she resells the property within 2 years after acquisition, or will give the seller or another 
a first option to buy . 
4 A requirement that purchasers waive or release any claim or right 
for nonperformance by the builder under the contract.   
• This does not prevent a builder from obtaining a statement from 
the purchaser at closing that he or she has inspected the house 
and has not observed any unsatisfactory construction. 
• Nor does it prevent the builder from obtaining a release from 
the purchaser in settlement of a bona fide dispute.

a. Equal 
Housing 
Opportunity Laws and Regulations  RLC s may recommend or impose sanctions (subject to the rules and limitations 
applicable to the particular sanction) against program participants for violations of statutory provisions and regulations governing equal opportunity in housing.  These laws and regulations include the following:  
 Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act (ECOA)
.  ECOA prohibits lenders from 
discriminating against credit applicants on  the basis of:  
• Race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status,  
• Age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding 
contract),  
• All or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, and  
• The applicant has in good faith exercised any full right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.  
 
It applies to applicants for nearly all types of credit, including home loans, and all aspects of the credit transaction, including:  
• The solicitation and takin g of applications  
• Information gathering and dissemination  
• Credit investigation  
• Standards of creditworthiness  
• Credit terms  
• Credit denial  
• Loan servicing and collections  
 
ECOA applies to classes of applicants as well as individual applicants; e.g., a lender m ay not ask pregnant applicants about their prospects for continued 
employment over a certain period unless the same question is asked of male applicants.  VA must comply with ECOA in its role as a processor of prior approval loans, and be watchful for viol ations by lenders when reviewing loan 
submissions.  VA may impose sanctions against a lender for ECOA violations 
or refer the case to the Department of Justice f or prosecution, if appropriate.

4 Once a final report is submitted, CO will advise the RLC  of the 
appropriate disposition of the case.  
 
Do not close a complaint, forward a final report to the complainant or respondent, or impose sanctions until the RLC  receives 
instructions from CO.  This is because sanctions may be imposed pursuant to 2 C.F.R. parts 180 a nd 801
 and a hearing required, with the burden 
of proof on VA.  CO will ensure the facts are well -developed and 
sufficient to document discrimination.

days following receipt of the CO notice and appropriately annotate the complaint.  
  
In some instances CO may determine that the complaint and supporting documentation should be referred to the Department of Justice for consideration of criminal or civil action, or to HUD, the Federal  Trade Commission, or another Federal A gency.  CO will 
provide appropriate instructions.

received.  
• Alphabetize all individual files by name.   
• Each file will contain the written complaint, and all subsequent correspondence, documents, and materials related to the complaint, the 
investigation, and ultimate resolution.  
• When the complaint has been closed, the originals of all material will be

materials, outreach , directives, informational issues, bulletins,  etc.), to 
industry partners must be reviewed, approved, and disseminated from L oan 
Guaranty Service Central Office (L GY CO) .  Regional Loan Centers ( RLCs ) 
are not permitted to issue the aforementioned external communication 
products to external stakeholders without prior approval from LGY CO, as outlined in this section.  Many lenders underwrite from centralized locations, 
but make loans from more than one geographic area , which makes  
consistency extremely important.  
 
b. CO

prior to publication to external sta keholders to include, but not limited to, 
lenders, servicers, staff appraisal reviewers, and appraisers.

coordinate with during CO’s review process . 
• Requested date of publication -  This is the date the RLC would like the 
communication to be publi shed. 
• Requested target audience (eg. lenders) . 
• Draft of the  communication to be published -  For example, if the RLC 
intends to publicize an informational webinar, submit a fully -developed 
announcement including webinar subject, date(s), time(s), registrati on

c. VA Form  
26-1880  VA Form 26 -1880, Request for a Certificate of Eli gibility , is the official 
application for determination of eligibility for the VA H ome Loan program.  
Without a properly completed VA Form 26- 1880 on file, V A will not be able 
to determine a Veteran ’s eligibility for the program.  
 
All necessary fields of VA Form 26- 1880  must be legibly completed and the 
form must be signed and dated by the Ve teran  or his/her legal representative 
(i.e., a VA -approved power of attorney or a fiduciary assigned through the 
courts.)  
 If an application is submitted through eBenefits
, it is not necessary  for the 
Veteran  to submit  VA Form 26 -1880 .  The Veteran ’s information is 
transferred from eBenefits and the VA employee can then access the record in WebLGY.  
 Note :  If the Loan S pecialist notes that VA Form 26 -1880
 is signed by 
someone other than the Veteran , he/she must verify the signatory is VA -
approved.  Check the Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator System (BIRLS)  inquiry screen in SHARE to verify the signatory and then, follow up 
with the Veteran  to ensure the application was submitted with their 
knowledge.    
  
c. Timeliness 
Requirements  Because the timeliness of the COE determination is paramount  to providing 
the Veteran  with notif ication of eligibility for a VA -guaranteed home loan, a 
timeliness requirement has been established.    
 RLCs  are responsible for issuing a  COE determination within 5 -business days 
of receipt (assigned to a Loan Specialis t) of the COE application . The 
timeliness criteria for acceptabl e performance are meeting the 5 -business day 
requirement  at least 98 percent  of the time, on a monthly basis. 
 Paper COE applications (mailed, faxed, emailed , or in person) must be 
entered into the ACE system within 2 -business days of the mailroom receipt 
date, and the application received date must be recorded in the “Details” page in the ACE system.  Then, the Loan Specialist will have 5- business days  from 
the date assigned  to process the COE determination. 
  
Note:  A determination is defined as  a returned application, an issued COE, a 
denial letter , or a case pending V eteran S ervice C enter  (VSC) referral. Any 
other status is not considered a determination for the timeliness requirement.

d. Escalation 
Procedures  On a case -by-case basis, a case must  be escalated to RLC management (L oan 
Production O fficer (LPO)/Assistant LPO) prior to escalation to C entral O ffice 
(CO).  The escalation must include RLC  Management’s analysis of the 
determination.   
 
The following steps must  be completed prior to submitting an escalated  
case to CO : 
 
Step  Action  
1 Document in the “note” function of the COE record the reason 
the case needs to be escalated.  For a list of case types  that will 
be escalated, see Appendix A. 
2 RLC management will review the employee ’s decision and 
concur or non -concur on the employee ’s recommendation, prior 
to submitting the case to CO for review.  
3 If the case needs to be referred to CO, RLC management must  
prepare a comprehensive report of findings, which includes a recommendation for the outcome of the determination.  
 Cases should be submitted to the CO  email box 
at LoanPolicy.VBAVACO@va.gov
. 
 
If the case does not need to be escalated, based on RLC  
management review, document the case notes and do not 
forward to CO.  
4 Provide CO Loan Policy with the case analysis (to inclu de 
recommendation) within the 5- business day processing 
timeframe for COEs.  
 
If notification to CO  is outside of the 5- business  day processing 
timeframe, local management must include an explanation for 
the del ay in the case recommendation.  
5 Once a final recommendation is submitted, CO will advise the 
station within 2 -business days from receipt of the escalation of 
the appropriate action to take. The time that the case is under CO  
review does not count agains t the RLC’s COE determination 
timeliness.

e. COE Issued 
in Error The COE is a critical document in determining whether the Veteran  is eligible 
for the benefit , and the loan amount the Veteran  is eligible for.  It is vital that 
every effort is taken to ensure the accuracy of each COE determination.   
 
• If VA issues a COE in error and the loan is closed, VA will honor that COE 
and no other transaction, to include Interest R ate R eduction R efinance 
Loans (IRRRLs) , cash-out refinances  or purchases , will be permitted  based 
upon the error COE .   
  
• If a COE was issued in error and the Veteran  requests an ROE , then no 
restoration of entitlement can be granted.  A COE will not be issued in this 
instance, unless the Veteran  can provide additional supporting 
documentation to establish  their eligibility for the benefit.  
 
• In the event that a COE is issued in error and the Veteran  has not closed on 
the loan , the RLC that issued the COE must immediately notify the Veteran  
and the lender , verbally and in writing, of the error and document WebLGY . 
 
• If a COE was issued in error, to include the green paper COEs, the Veteran 
must establish eligibility.  
 
In all instances above, the Loan Specialist must place a thorough explanation 
of the error in the notes section of the COE reference number.  Additionally, 
the Loan Specialist must make the necessary change to documentation that caused the error .  If the error wa s system generated, the RLC management 
must  notify VA CO immediately of the error.

Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updated to add language regarding the uncharacterized 
COS as acceptable in General COS and IRR COS cannot be used for R/NG 
COS (it must be R/NG time).  
  
a. ADS M 
Defined  An ADSM is considered a Veteran  eligible for VA home loan benefits if he or 
she served on active duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or 
Coast Guard for at least the minimum required LOS , and was discharged with 
an acceptable COS . 
 An ADSM is also a Veteran  who previously se rved or is currently serving on 
active duty full time.  This includes both officers and enlisted personnel.  
 
ADSM does not include Selected R /NG members who serve(d) full time , 
unless he or she served under the authority in Title 10 of the U.S. Code.  
Eligibility requirements for this group are discussed later in this chapter.

b. LOS 
Requirements  For Veterans whose service included any part of the period before  September 
8, 1980 (enlisted personnel), or October 17, 1981 (officers), the minimum 
required LOS is as follows:  
  
• 90 days or more, any part of which occurred during wartime.  If the 
discharg e documents reflect 90 or more days of continuous active duty 
service with an acceptable COS, the Veteran is eligible, regardless of the 
narrative reason for discharge.  
OR 
• 181 continuous days or more during peacetime.  If the discharge 
documents reflect 1 80 or more days of continuous active duty service with 
an acceptable COS, the Veteran is eligible, regardless of the narrative 
reason for discharge.   
 A greater LOS requirement has been established for Veterans who:  
 
• Enlisted (and service began) after September 7, 1980, or  
• Officers whose service began after October 16, 1981. 
 
Such Veterans are subject to the 2- year requirement
 and must have completed 
either:  
 
• 24 months or more of continuous service, or  
• The full period for which ordered to active duty , but not less than 90 days 
(any part during wartime) or 181 continuous days (peacetime).

Continued  
  
c. Specifics on 
the 2 -year 
requirement  Generally, both enlistment and commencement of active duty in a regular 
component of the Armed Forces must have occurred after September 7, 1980, 
for the 2 -year requirement  to apply ( the 2 -year requirement  does not apply if 
the individual was a lready serving in the Armed Forces on or before 
September 7, 1980, when an overlap occurs ).  However, the 2 -year 
requirement  applies to individuals who enlisted before September 7, 1980 if:  
• They were separated from service without completing  the 90 or 181 
continuous days  active duty requirement , then began active duty after 
September 7, 1980, regardless of any Reserve duty prior to that date.  
OR 
• Enlistment was under the Delayed Entry Program and active duty began 
after September 7, 1980.  
OR 
• The Veteran  was an officer whose service began after October 16, 1981.  
 
Refer the case to local RLC/R egional O ffice management if the applicant has 
enlisted service in other than a regular component of the Armed Forces and it 
is unclear whether the 2 -year requirement  applies.  
  
d. LOS  
Exception 
Note  If an ADSM is later discharged  without having met the full 2 -year 
requirement , and no valid LOS exception exists, eligibility is lost.  It may be  
possible for a Veteran  to have been eligible when a prior VA loan was 
obtained while on active duty, and then no longer be eligible to participate in 
the program after having been discharged.

f. Other 
Qualifying 
Service  Active duty pursuant to Executive Order 10957, dated August 10, 1 961, is 
considered active duty in a non- training assignment.  The DD- 214 denotes 
separation from active duty status, but not from membership in the R/NG  
component . 
  
 Example 1:  John served 90 days active duty, 89  days in peacetime, and 1 day 
during the Korean conflict.  He is eligible.  
  
 Example 2:  Katie enlisted in 2003 , for 24 months, but was discharged for 
pregnancy after 18 months.  She neither completed 24 months of continuous service, nor completed the period for which she was ordered to active duty. 
Katie is not eligible.  
  
 Example 3:  Ernest was a Nationa l Guard member activated in 2005 , under 
Title 10 U.S.C. orders.  His DD- 214 narrative states that he completed the term 
for which he was ordered to active duty.  Ernest completed at least 90 days during wartime, and he completed the period for which he was  ordered to 
active duty.  Ernest is eligible.  
  
 Example 4:  Jane, a National Guard member, completed 90 days active duty as 
AGR under T itle 10 U.S.C. in 1979.  In 1981, she received anothe r active duty 
assignment under T itle 10.  The orders called for 24 months, but she was 
released after 18 months so she could attend college.  She is not eligible based on her 1979 service because she did not complete 181 days (which is required during a peacetime era), and she is not eligible based on her 1981 service because she did not complete the full term for which she was ordered to active 
duty.

g. Cadets  Military academy cadets can be screened for eligibility using the General Rule 
of Eligibility for ADSM s.   
 
• The length and COS  requirements for enlistees also applies to cadets.  
• Cadet discharge information may be entered on the  DD- 214, or it may 
consist of a letter from the academy itself.  
• Transcrip ts alone are not sufficient evidence of service.  
• Service as a cadet that is contiguous with service as an enlistee may be 
considered to be a single LOS .  
 
Note :  Cadet service does not include ROTC membership.  Membership in 
ROTC does not qualify for the VA home loan guaranty benefit.  
  
Example: Hugo was a Naval Academy cadet for 18 months.  He withdre w 
from the academy and entered i nto active duty where he served for 6 months.  
Both his time at the academy and his discharge from active duty service was 
honorable.  Hugo is eligible.  
  
h. Service 
with Allied Countries in World War II  
Exception  A Veteran  who served in the active military or naval service of a government 
allied with the United States in World War II under conditions other than dishonorable is eligible, if he or she meets 
all of the following conditions:  
• The applicant served 90 days or more , any part of which occurred 
during World War II, or by reason of injury or disability incurred in service in line of  duty served less than 90 days , and  
• The applicant's service was at a time when the government allied with 
the U nited S tates was at war  with  the common enemy,  and 
• At the time of entrance into such active service, the applicant was a citizen
 of the United States,  and 
• The applicant is a resident  (citizen ship not required) of the United 
States when application is made, and

r. Applicability 
of Other 
Exceptions  The exceptions for a Veteran  discharged or released for a SCD , an un -
remarried surviving spouse of a Veteran  who died while in service or from a 
SCD , a spouse of a serviceperson missing in action or prisone r of war or 
exceptions to the 2- year requirement  apply to eligibility through these other 
types of qualifying service.  
  
s. General 
Notes Pertaining to Exceptions  • If the DD-214 reflects multiple potential exception s in the narrative, the 
Veteran  only needs to qualify for a single exception.  
• Examples of DD- 214  narratives that are not exception s include the 
following:  
• Physical standards (includes a failure to meet) , 
• Disability incurred while on unauthorized absence , 
• Volunteered to serve with National Guard / Reserves , 
• Resignation , 
• Voluntary – Miscellaneous reasons , 
• Conscientious objector , 
• Erroneous entry , and  
• Substance abuse failure.  
 
Note:  AGR members who have been activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders 
must have a  narrative that indicates the Veteran  completed the term to which 
ordered to active duty.  
 
   
Example : Chang enlisted in 1987, and was discharged after 7 months.  His 
DD-214 narrative stated “COG, Dyslexia”.  Though Chang does not meet the 
requirements established for the COG exception, he does meet the CIWD  
exception  because Dyslexia was listed in the narrative.  Therefore, Chang is 
eligible.

Continued  
  
t. COS  
Requirements  A Veteran  must complete at least one satisfactory period of service to be 
deemed eligible.  If a Veteran  is discharged with an unsatisfactory CO S, but 
had a previous or subsequent tour that was satisfactory, the Veteran  may still 
qualify using the satisfactory tour.  For enlisted Service members, a 
reenlistment or extension will satisfy that the COS  was satisfactory.  
 
An acceptable COS  includes:  
•  Honorable , 
•  General , and  
• Under  Honorable Conditions . 
 In instances where the DD -214 has a COS of Uncharacterized, it is treated as 
General.  
 
Note:  The Department of Defense ( DOD) is responsible for annotating  the 
discharge status on the DD -214 (or o ther separating documentation).   Based 
on experience, each Secretary of  the DOD may use different language to 
represent the discharge status for a Veteran .  VA employees making 
eligibility determinations should pay close attention to the description of a 
Veteran s’ COS  to ensure compliance with VA requirements.

Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updated to provide clarification that IRR COS is not 
sufficient to meet VA’s  COE requirement and correspondence courses do 
not count towards creditable service time.  
  
a. General 
Rule for 
Eligibility – R/NG  Members of the R /NG, who have neither a qualifying tour as an ADSM , nor a 
qualifying Title 10 U.S.C. activation , must have 6 creditable years of service 
and receive an Honorable discharge to be eligible. 
 
Note : If a member of the R/NG has a qualifying tour as an ADSM, use that 
tour to determine eligibility.  
  
c. Selected 
Reserve Defined  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit within the Ready Reserve 
designated by their respective services and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have priority over all other reserves.  All Selected Reservists are in an active status.  The Selected Reserve also includes individuals in active duty for training status.  
Selected Reserve members participate actively in training periods (drills) and serve on active duty for ADT each year.  This includes reserve members of the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.  This category also 
includes members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard.  
  
d. AGR 
Defined  Some Selected Reserve members may also be designated as AGR.  Such 
members have been ordered to active duty at so me point in their R/NG career. 
It is necessary to determine which type of orders an AGR served under (e.g. Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32 U.S.C.).  If the service is performed un der Title 32 
U.S.C., then the 6- year requirement applies.

Continued  
  
e. Individual 
Mobilization 
Augmentee (IMA)  
Eligibility  
 IMA members perform their inactive training duty with an active duty 
organization and are not typically assigned to a Reserve or Guard unit.  As members of the Selected Reserve, they are subject to immediate, involuntary order to active duty whenever a Pr esidential reserve call -up is invoked under 
Title 10, United States Code, Section 12304 (10 U.S.C. 12304). They are also 
subject to involuntary order to active duty in time of war or national emergency when declared by the President or Congress under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 12301, 12302, or 12303. IMA members activated under this Title would qua lify as if they were an ADSM.  
  
f. IRR 
Eligibility  The period of IRR service is not creditable toward the 6 -year requirement  for 
R/NG members, nor does it count toward the service requirements established for ADSM.   Also, IRR COS does not count .  The R/NG time COS must be 
Honorable.  
  
g. Procedures 
for Determining Eligibility  • Step 1: Does the Veteran  have a qualifying tour as an ADSM as per the 
General Rule of Eligibility for ADSM?  
• Yes.  Go no further.  Issue the COE using the enlistee status. 
• No.  Go to step 2. 
• Step 2: Has the Veteran  been activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders?  
• Yes.  Apply the General Rule of Eligibility for ADSM and if 
eligible issue the COE as ADSM.  If not eligible , go to step 3.  
• No.  Go to step 3.  
• Step 3: Does the Veteran  have a qualifying tour as per the General Rule of 
Eligibility for AGR?  
• Yes.  Issue the COE utilizing the AGR status.  
• No.  Go to step 4. Review the list  of exceptions ( Topic 7).  
• Step 4: Are there any exceptions that might apply?  
• Yes.  Review the criteria for the exception and ensure it does apply to the Veteran . 
• No.  Applicant is not eligible .

h. COS  
Requirements 
– R/NG  If discharged, R/NG members must have received an Honorable discharge for 
their reserve service.  A discharge of General, Under Honorable Conditions, Under Other Than Honorable Conditions, Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable is not acceptable.  If the member is s till actively participating, no COS  determination 
is required.  
An Honorable COS  must be provided for each separate tour or component.  If 
an R/NG member has a gap in tours with the same component, or changes components, each separate tour must be qualified in order for it to count 
toward the 6- year requirement . Care must be taken to ensure that a document 
that evidences a COS  applies to the period of service in question. 
 Example 1:  Jim joined the National Guard and served 6 creditable years.  
However, he received an Under Honorable Conditions discharge.  Jim is not eligible.  
 
 Example 2:  Lauren is currently a member of the National Guard.  Her 
statement of service letter indicates she has been a member and actively participating  for 7 continuous years.  No COS  is mentioned.  Lauren is 
eligible.  
 
 Example 3:  After acquiring 5 years of creditable reserve service, Geraldine 
was discharged in 2007, with an Honorable discharge.  In 2008, she joined the 
Army Reserves for 2  years.  She  attended drills and earned inactive duty for 
training (IDT) points for both years, and was honorably discharged.  Geraldine is now eligible since she has at least 6 creditable years of service and an 
Honorable discharge for each tour served.  
  
 Example 4: Mortimer served in the Army Reserve for 3 years and was 
discharged.  A year later he again enlisted in the Army Reserves and served for 3 more years.   Mortimer has evidence of his honorable discharge for the second tour, but does not have documentation evidencing the COS  of his first 
tour.   Mortimer has not provided sufficient evidence to be considered eligible.

h. COS  
Requirements 
– R/NG, 
(continued ) Example 5:  Mortimer provides additional evidence in the form of an 
honorable discharge from the time he spent  in the IRR .  Mortimer still has not 
provided sufficient evidence to be considered as eligible since time spent in 
the IRR is not creditable, nor i s the COS  for IRR service applicable.  
  
 Example 6:  Mortimer presents a case whereby he claims he evidently served 
honorably on the first tour in the Reserve;  otherwise he would not have been 
eligible to enlist for a second time.  The basis for such a claim is invalid.  A reenlistment or subsequent enlistment is not sufficient evidence that a 
previous tour was served honorably.  
  
i. LOS  
Requirements – R/NG  R/NG  members must complete 6  creditable years of service.  
 Note :  For Army, Navy, Air Force, or Coast Guard R/NG Veteran s, 
membership in the Reserves or National Guard begins on the date the enlistment contract is signed, even if the member does not report for  training 
for several months.  The Marine Corps does not consider the Veteran  a 
member of its Selected Reserve until he or she begins active- duty training.  
 The period of service served as a member of the IRR is not creditable for qualifying purposes.  
 If an R/NG member has a qualifying tour as an ADSM, the member should be granted eligibility based upon that tour.  This allows the Veteran  to utilize the 
lower funding fee established for ADSM.  
 
If an AGR member has been activated under Title 10 U.S.C., the General Rule 
for Eligibility for ADSM applies.

Continued  
  
j. Creditable 
Service 
Defined  For a period o f R/NG  service to be deemed creditable , the Veteran  must have 
received at least one point , in addition to the automatic 15 membership points, 
during the anniversary year.  The first and the last year may have been prorated.  As a result, those years may not have the 15 membership points.  However, the pror ated membership points plus the IDT or ADT may allow the 
Veteran to have a creditable year.  
 
The anniversary year covers the 12 -month period commencing on the month 
and day that the Veteran  began service.  If a Veteran  entered service on March 
3, each anni versary year runs from March 3 to March 2 of the following year . 
 
To calculate a qualify ing year, add membership points and ADT and 
IDT/weekend drill points , which must equal at least 16 points . Correspondence 
course  points  must not  be added because they are not qualifying points . 
 
 Example 1 : Geraldine enlisted in the Reserve on July 3, 2001.  She attended 
one drill in November 2001, and did not return the rest of the year.  She received points for the year, therefore the year  (July 3, 2001 through July 2, 
2002)  is deemed to be creditable.  
  
 Example 2 : Geraldine did not drill for the next 13 months, but did attend drills 
regularly thereafter until her discharge on July 2, 2007.  Her point statement reflected IDT points for 5 years  and membership points for 6 years.  Geraldine 
is not eligible since she did not earn qualifying points for 6 years.  
 
Note :  The 6 years  of service need not be continuous, nor in the same 
component or unit.  
  
k. Retired 
R/NG  
Members  Members of the Reserves or Guard who have completed 20 years of service 
often receive a ‘20 -year letter’ , which verifies the successful completion of 20 
years as an active R/NG member.

applicant's unit to verify current service.  Th e statement of service must clearly 
indicate:  
• The Veteran ’s full name , 
• Social security number (last 4 digits is acceptable) , 
• The date of entry i nto active duty , 
• The duration of lost time, if any , 
• The name of the co mmand providing the information, 
• The type of orders the Veteran  is serving under (typical ly Title 10

 4. Activated Reservist and National Guard  Members  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updated to revise the requirement for documentation 
for NG to include both the NGB22 and the NGB 23.  
  
a. Activated 
R/NG 
Members Defined  R/NG members typically perform their duties under an inactive duty training 
status; IDT consists of weekend drills.  When a n R/NG member is activated, 
the member may be serving under an ADT status, or may be serving in a duty status that is not part of any training exercise (e.g. mobilization).  
 
  
b. Exception  If an R/NG member has been activated in a  non-training status, the member 
may be eligible to qualify using the General Rule for Eligibility that covers ADSM.  To qualify, the following conditions must exist:  
• Activation must be under Title 10 U.S.C.,  
• Activation cannot be for training purposes,  
• The member must meet the General Rule for Eligibility LOS 
requirements established for ADSM, and  
• The member must meet the General Rule for Eligibility COS 
requirements established for ADSM.  
 
 Example 1 : In 1991, Clyde’s National Guard unit was activated under Title 10 
U.S.C. orders for a non -training purpose.  Clyde served for 5 months and was 
given a General discharge after having completed the period to which he was 
ordered to active duty.  Clyde is eligible because he met the 90 days for 
ADSM requireme nt.

b. Exception, 
continued Example 2: In 1994, Ben’s National Guard unit was activated under Title 32 
U.S.C. orders for a non -training purpose.  Ben served for 10 months and was 
honorably discharged after having completed the period to which he was 
ordered to active duty.  Ben is not eligible because his service is considered active duty for training under Title 32 U.S.C.  However, he did accrue points that may be counted toward the 6- year requirement.  
 
In some cases, the DD -214 for an R/NG member who was activated under 
Title 10 U. S.C. in a non- training status erroneously indicates the period of 
service was for active duty training.  If there is uncertainty about the accuracy of a training declaration on a DD -214, the Loan Specialist will escalate the 
case to RLC management for revi ew.  The RLC management may confer with 
CO for clarification, and make a determination.  
  
c. Reserve vs. 
National Guard – A Comparison  Reserve members who have been activated typically fall under Title 10 U.S.C. 
orders since unlike the National Guard; Res ervists are not subject to 
activations by the state.  However, the type of orders must be verified so as to ensure the member was not activated under an authority other than Title 10 U.S.C. 
 
 Example 1 : Carl was a member of the Army Reserve and in 1991, was 
activated for a non -training purpose and served for 95 days before being 
honorably discharged.  Carl provided a copy of his orders as evidence that his 
activation was under Title 10 U.S.C.  Carl is eligible.  
  
 Example 2:  Murphy was a member of the Naval reserve.  He was activated 
due to the potential commencement of a war action in 1990, but his orders were not issued under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C.  His unit was demobilized without having the orders convert to Tit le 10 U.S.C.  Murphy is 
not eligible.

d. Other 
Activation 
Classification  National Guard members may be activated under other classifications of orders 
as well as Title 10 U.S.C.  Typically, the Guard member will be activated either under Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32.  Any classification of activation orders may be for training purposes only.  
 
 Example:  Clive was a member of the National Guard.  In 2003 , he was 
activated for a non -training purpose and served for 95 days before being 
honorably discharged.  Eligibility cannot be determined for Clive until it can 
be established that he had been activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders.  
  
e. Activation 
for Trai ning 
under  Title 10  Activations for the purposes of training, even under Title 10 U .S.C., only 
count toward the 6- year requirement .  AGR members activated for training 
cannot have such service used for qualifying via the General Rule for Eligibility for AD SM. 
 
 Example:  Jeremiah was a member of the Naval Reserve.  He was activated in 
2008, served for 6 months, and was honorably discharged.  His DD- 214 
indicated he had been activated for MOS training.  Jeremiah’s service only 
counts toward his 6 -year requirement .

f.  Tacking 
Rule – R/NG  If the period of a Title 10 U.S.C. , non-training activation is not sufficient to 
meet the LOS  requirements established under the General Rule for Eligibility 
for ADSM, the period of service counts toward the 6- year requirement  for 
R/NG members.  
 
If the R/NG member is subsequently activated again in a non- training status 
under Title 10 U.S.C., the  period of service may be tacked together with 
previous non- training Title 10 tours in an attempt to meet the LOS  
requirement.  Once the minimum LOS  requirement has been met, the R/NG 
member may qualify using the General Rule of Eligibility for ADSM.  The 
tacked tours must all have an Honorable discharge in order to make the R/NG 
eligible.  
  
 Example 1 : Marci was activated for 60 days under Title 10 U.S.C. orders in a 
non-training capacity.  She was demobilized and granted an Honorable COS .  
Marci is not eligible because her service was less than 90 days.  
  
 Example 1a: After 1 year , Marci was again activated under Title 10 U.S.C. 
orders in a non- training capacity for wartime service.  Once Marci reached the 
day 30 of her activation, she became eligible while still active.  She remained 
eligible up to the moment she was discharged.  
  
 Example 1b: Marci was H onorably discharged from the second tour after a 
total of 45 days of service. Her DD-214 narrative disclosed that she completed 
the period to which she was ordered to active duty.  Marci remains in an eligible status.  
 
If Marci received anything other than an Honorable discharge for the second tour, or if the DD- 214 narrative failed to reflect that Marci completed the 
period of service for which she was called to active duty, she would lose her 
eligibility.

 5.  Rules for Calculating Length of Active Duty Service  
 
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updated to revise grammar and formatting.  
  
a. Purpose  The General Rule for Eligibility requires active service of 90 days, 181 
continuous days, or 24 continuous months, depending on applicant's 
circumstances.  This section contains the rules and procedures necessary for 
determining the length of an applicant's ac tive duty service.  
  
b. Procedures 
for Calculating Length of Active Service  The following steps are used to calculate the length of a Veteran 's active duty 
service.  Rules for analyzing lost time, travel time, whether time is qualifying or not, and whether  tacking applies , can be found under appropriate headings 
following this chart.  
 
Step  Action  
1 Identify period(s) of active service by comparing the entry date 
onto active duty with the separation date . 
2 If the Veteran  has more than one period of active service, add the 
periods together if necessary to establish eligibility permitted 
under the tacking rule, which is described below.  
3 Evaluate reasons for any lost time . 
4 Exclude (d educt ) non-qualifying lost time . 
5 Deduct other non -qualifying types of time . 
6 If necessary to establish eligibility, obtain certification of travel 
time. 
7 Add certified travel time .

 5.  Rules for Calculating Length of  Active Duty Service , 
Continued  
  
c. Tacking 
Rule  Two or more periods of active service, any part of which occurred during 
wartime with an acceptable COS , may be added together to total the 90 days 
active service required during wartime.  
 
Tacking may not  be used to establish eligibility under the 181 continuous days 
during peacetime requirement or the 24 continuous months requirement because separate periods are not considered to be continuous.  
Example:  In 1992, Karen's reserve unit was ordered to active  duty in the 
Persian Gulf.  She served 75 days.  In 1995, Karen was ordered to active duty, and sent to the Republic of Haiti in support of Operation Uphold/Maintain 
Democracy.  She served 45 days.  Karen is eligible for a regular COE because she completed  90 days of active service during wartime (Persian Gulf War) by 
"tacking" the two periods of active service together.  
  
d. Lost Time  If the Veteran's proof of military service contains no reference to lost time, it 
will be assumed there was none. 
 Certain types of lost time must be deducted from the period of active duty service.  When deduction of lost time would render the applicant ineligible, 
and the reason for the lost time is not clearly indicated on the discharge 
papers, determine the reason for the lost time by consulting the appropriate branch of the service or permitting the Veteran to provide documentation.  
 
Lost time does not constitute a break in an otherwise continuous period of 
active duty.  It merely reduces the LOS.  
  
e. Qualifying 
Lost Time  This is time lost for reasons other than those considered as non -qualifying.  
For enlisted ADSMs, this time is generally already added to the end of the 
service requirement.  As a result, this time is not excluded.

active duty:  
• Periods of agricultural, industria l and indefinite furlough,  
• Time under arrest in the absence of acquittal , 
• Time the applicant was determined to have forfeited pay by reason of 
absence without official leave, or  
• Time spent in desertion or while undergoing sentence of court martial .

g. Other Non -
qualifying 
Time  The following time may not be included in the period of active service:  
• Time spent as a temporary member of the Coast Guard Reserve, even if 
the applicant was on active full -time duty with pay,  
• Time between the date of induction, of enlistment in the Reserves, or of commission, and actual entrance upon active service, unless applicant was 
issued orders placing him or her on active duty for authorized travel, and  
• Periods of active duty for training (AC DUTRA or ADTNG).

h. Travel 
Time  Certified travel time may be included in the period of active service for an 
applicant whose discharge or separation papers indicate at least 83  days , but 
less than 90 days , active service during wartime, or at least 174  days , but less 
than 181 days , continuous active service during peacetime.  
 
Travel time must be certified by the applicant's branch of service and may include:  
• Authorized travel to and from active duty , or 
• Travel required to  proceed home by the most direct route, beginning after 
midnight on the date of discharge or release . 
 
An applicant dissatisfied with the certificati on may submit a statement to VA 
explaining his or her objection to the service department's travel 
determination and/or determination of:  
• The location of the Veteran 's home or place of residence upon discharge 
or release from active duty , 
• The length of travel time allowed for the Veteran  to reach home upon 
discharge or release from active duty , or 
• The amount of authorized travel time to the place of entry upon active 
duty.  
 
Submit the applicant's statement and any pertinent evidence to the servic e 
department for recertification.  An applicant dissatisfied with the 
recertification will be advised of his or her right to apply to the Chairman, 
Board of Correction of Military Records of the service department . 
  
i. Service for 
Pay Purposes  Many discharge or sep aration papers provide the LOS  for pay purposes.  This 
should not be relied upon as a measure of active duty service.

Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updated to revise the DIC funds that are not acceptable 
to include 1151 and pension.  
  
a. Surviving 
Spouse 
Definition  Unmarried surviving spouses of Veteran s who die on active duty , or later 
from  service- connected causes , may also be eligible for the  VA-guaranteed  
home loan benefit.  Also, a surviving spouse of a Veteran  who dies on active 
duty or from  service- connected causes  may still be eligible if remarried on or 
after age 57 , and on or after December 16, 2003.  
  
b. Basic 
Eligibility  The VSC  must first determin e that the applicant is a  surviving spouse , eligible 
for or in  receipt of certain types of DIC.  In addition, the surviving spouse 
must meet VA’s definition of a surviving spouse, as described below under Basic Eligibility.   
 The surviving spouse of a Veteran , who died while in active service or from  a 
SCD , that  is not a qualified Veteran in their own right , is eligible regardless of 
the LOS of the deceased Veteran . (See Exception 2  of this section.)  
 Eligibility may also be gra nted to the spouse of an active- duty member who is 
listed as missing in action (MIA) or a prisoner of war (POW) for at least 90 days.  Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited to one -time use 
only.  
 Surviving spouses of Veteran s who died from service connected causes  
may also be eligible if any of the following conditions are met:  (1) the 
Veteran  was rated totally disabled for 10 years or more immediately 
preceding death; or (2) was rated totally  disabled for not less than 5 years 
from date of discharge or release from active duty to date of death, or (3) the Veteran  was a former prisoner of war who died after September 30, 1999, and 
was rated totall y disabled for not less than 1 y ear immediately preceding 
death.

b. Basic 
Eligibility , 
continued Surviving spouse entitlement is determined using a VA Form 26 -1817 , 
Request for Determination of Loan Guaranty Eligibility -  Unmarried 
Surviving Spouses .  A review must first be made to determine if the surviving 
spouse is eligible based on his/her own service.  If the surviving spouse is 
determined to be a qualified Veteran  in their own right , then pro cess as a 
normal entitlement with a VA Form 26 -1880 , Request for a Certificate of 
Eligibility . 
 If the surviving spouse has Veteran  status as a result of his/her own military 
service, then the surviving spouse should attempt to qualify as a Veteran .  If 
he/she cannot qualify as a Veteran , then the application should be determined 
whether  he/she qualifies as a surviving spouse.  
 If the surviving spouse is submitting a  loan  application for an IRRRL , there is 
no need to submit a  COE  application , as long as the surviving spouse 
appeared on the loan to be refinanced  with the Veteran .  If the surviving 
spouse was not on the loan, he/she would only be permitted to complete a cash-out refinance , upon qualification as a surviving spouse .  
 A surviving spouse with their own entitlement may be exempt from paying a funding fee, if in receipt of DIC .  The DIC must be awarded as primary, 
secondary, ancillary or Chapter 38.  If the surviving spouse is in receipt of 1151 or pension, they do not qualify for the VA home loan benefit.  
 
The Loan Specialist must review information in SHARE, Virtual VA , and 
VBMS to determine whether the surviving spouse is receiving DIC.  
  
c. Escalation  The proc ess of issuing COEs is multi -pronged and there are instances where a 
case will need to be escalated to CO  Loan Policy for review and determination.  
In those instances, local management must  review the case and contact CO  
Loan Policy for guidance.

d.  
Exception 1: 
Remarried Surviving Spouse  A remarried surviving spouse must apply to the Pension Management Center 
of jurisdiction to determine eligibility for con tinued receipt of DIC.  Upon 
redetermination of a qualifying grant for DIC , the spouse may reapply to the 
Atlanta RLC for eligibility for home loan benefits.  
 A remarried, surviving spouse whose marriage is void or annulled by a court, is not considered a remarriage; i.e., does not make the surviving spouse ineligible .  A surviving spouse who remarries on or after attaining age 57 and 
on or after December 16, 2003, may be eligible for the home loan benefit.  
 Example 1: Jane, the surviving spouse of a Veter an who died in active service 
during the Vietnam era was remarried in 1980, and then divorced in 1985.  She is eligible, and remains so unless she remarries.  
 
Example 2: John, the surviving spouse of a Veteran who died in active service during the Gulf War  era and is in receipt of DIC was remarried at age 58.  He 
is eligible, and remains so after his marriage.  
  
e.  
Exception 2: Total Disability and POW  Eligibility for home loan benefits is extended to the surviving spouse of a 
Veteran : 
• Who was rated totally disabled for a period of 10 or more years 
immediately preceding death,  but did not die from a  SCD , is eligible 
for home loan benefi ts; 
• Who was rated totally disabled for a period of not less than 5 years 
from the date of discharge or  other release from active duty;  
• Who was a former POW who died after September 30, 1999, and the 
disability was rated totally disabled f or a period of not less than 1 year 
immediately preceding death;  and 
• Is in receipt of a qualifying DIC benefit award  (primar y, secondary, 
ancillary, or Chapter 38) .  DIC benefits awarded from 38 U .S.C. 1318 
or 1151 do not qualify for the VA -guaranteed  home loan benefit .

f. Exception 3: 
Spouse of  
Serviceperson 
Determined MIA or POW  The spouse of a serviceperson who is listed for more than 90 days as MIA or 
a POW is eligible as long as the S erviceperson remains in such status and the  
spouse remains married to the S erviceperson.  
 For purposes of thi s exception, MIA/POW includes a Servicemember  
captured in the line of duty by a hostile force or forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign government or power.  
 
Note: The spouse is limited to one use of the VA home loan benefit, pursua nt 
to 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(3).  
  
g. Special 
Procedures  Special procedures for processing a surviving spouse electron ic application 
created in the WebLGY Portal:  
 
Step  Action  
1 Review the completed, signed, and dated VA F orm 26 -1817  in 
correspondence.  If the 26 -1817 is not in the system, a return 
application will be sent requesting that one be uploaded prior to 
proceeding . 
2 Research SHARE and possibl y VBMS t o determine eligibility of 
the surviving spouse.  
3 If the s urviving spouse is eligible, the Loan S pecialist will 
process the COE to show entitlement code “06” and email to the 
lender.  
4 If the surviving s pouse is not eligible, the request will be denied 
and the proper letter will be uploaded to correspondence section in WebLGY.  A statement to this affect will be placed in “Notes”, and a copy emailed to the lender and the appropriate attachments, including  an appeal form, sent by mail to the surviving spouse (if 
both addresses are provided).  
 
  
h. Entitlement  The entitlement of the spouse is independent from that of the Servicemember . 
Therefore, the spouse's entitlement is not reduced by any prior use of entitlement by the Servicemember , and the Servicemember  entitlement is not 
reduced by any use of entitlement by the spouse.

 7. Length of S ervice  Exceptions for A ctive D uty 
Servicemembers  
  
Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updated to remove R/NG exception and renumber the 
topics and place R/NG exception under Topic 8.  
  
a. Exceptions  
For ADSM  There are exceptions to the minimum LOS  requirements for ADSM.  Only two 
exceptions are applicable to those Veteran s who are not subject to the 2- year 
requirement .  All exceptions apply to those Veteran s subject to the 2- year 
requirement .  
  
b. Exception 
1: Discharge 
for a SCD A Veteran  discharged or released for a SCD  is not subject to a minimum LOS  
requirement.  A discharge for a SCD  is the only exception for R/NG  members.  
 
The Veteran  must have been discharged or released specifically due to the SCD .  
If the Veteran  was discharged or released from service for a reason other than a 
SCD , this exception does not apply.  
 The subsequent awarding of SCD  compensation by VA is not evidence that a 
Veteran  was discharged due to a SCD , regardless of the percentage of the 
rating . 
 DD-214  or NGB  22 Narrative may include:  
• Discharge for SCD , 
• Disability with severance pay , 
• Disability without severance pay,  
• Disability – Retired list, and 
• Temporary Disability Retired List.  
 
 Example 1:  Jose was injured on h is second day of recruit training.  The injury 
was determined to be service- connected and resulted in his  discharge for 
disability.  Jose is eligible.  
  
 Example 2: Rupert was injured during his first week of USMC recruit training 
and was thereby deemed to  be ineligible for the military occupational specialty 
(MOS) for which he had contracted, but was otherwise fit for duty.  The Marines offered Rupert an alternative MOS, but he instead opted to be discharged since no other MOS appealed to him.  Rupert was not discharged 
due to a SCD , so he is not eligible.

b. Exception 
1: SCD 
(Continued)  Example 3:  Irving enlisted in 2003, and was discharged 2 months later due to 
hardship.  At the time of discharge, Irving was awarded SCD compensation. 
Irving is not eligible.  Thoug h he was recognized as having a  SCD, the 
disability was not the reason for his early discharge.  
  
 Example 4:  George enlisted in 1986, and was honorably discharged 5 months 
later.  The narrative on his DD -214 stated that he had been placed on the 
Temporary Disability Retired List.  George is eligible. Though the term ‘temporary’ was used , the Discharge for Disability exception still applies 
since the disability was the specific reason for George’s discharge.  
 
 VA SCD  compensation documentation is not adequate evidence to indicate a 
Veteran  was discharged due to a SCD .  The following are required documents 
to determine a SCD  exception:  
 Application Materials for SCD  exceptions include:   
1.  VA Form 26 -1880
, Request for a Certificate of Elig ibility , 
2.  Official service records/documents (or data contained in internal electronic systems) substantiating discharge or release for  a SCD , and 
3.  A DD- 214. 
 Refer to your local station management if:  
• The Veteran claims discharge or release for a SCD  and documentation 
is unclear,  
• The adequacy of documents submitted to verify service is in question, or 
• Doubt exists for any other reason.

c. Exception 
2: Veteran  is 
Currently on 
Active Duty  This exception applies to ADSMs who are currently on active duty.  
 An enlistee who is currently serving on active duty must only meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day (peacetime) minimum LOS requirement.  
• The 24- month requirement does not apply until the Veteran  has been 
discharged.  
• The COS  is automatically considered to be honorable.   
 
If the Veteran  has a qualifying prior active duty tour, that tour can be used for 
qualification purposes.  
  
Example:  Wilbur enlisted in the Army 90 days ago (wartime) and is still 
serving on active duty.  Wilbur is eligible.  A statement of service signed by or at the direction of the adjutant or personnel officer or commanding officer of the applicant's unit i s required as proof of 
military service.  An electronic signature on the document is acceptable.  The statement of service must clearly indicate:  
• The Veteran ’s full name , 
• Social security number (last 4 digits is acceptable) , 
• The date of entry onto active duty , 
• The duration of lost time, if any , and  
• The name of the command providing the information. 
 
If the statement of service being provided is for an activated member of the 
R/NG, it must include the type of orders under which the Veteran  is serving 
(typica lly Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32) and whether the Veteran  is serving in a 
training status.  If VA systems indicate that person is on active duty and has 
been for the required length of time, a conditioned COE can be issued without 
the documentation noted abo ve.

d. Subsequent 
Discharge  If the Veteran  is later discharged prior to completing the minimum LOS 
required for the era of service, or is discharged under Other Than Honorable, 
Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable conditions, the Veteran  is no longer eligible. 
Please be aware that a COS  indicated as Other than Honorable or Bad Conduct 
will be submitted to a VS C for review in order to determine if an upgrade to an 
acceptable COS  can be made.   These cases would follow the escalation 
process stated in section 1c of this Chapter.  
 
 Example:  Mike enlisted in 1992 , and served 90 days on active duty.  At that 
point he became eligible and used his home loan benefit.  However, he was discharged for misconduct after having served just 18 months.  His COS  was 
Under Honorable Conditions.  Therefore, while Mike was once eligible and received a valid COE, he is no longer eligible since he did not complete the 
required 24 months of service.  
  
e. Special 
Procedures for "Still on Active Duty" Exception  The procedures below apply to ADSMs who have not met the 2 -year 
requirement , but are eligible because they are still on activ e duty and have met 
the 90 or 181 day requirement of the General Rule for Eligibility.   
 
If Then  
Applicant is eligible 
by reason of this exception and is still 
on active duty … …COE should be conditioned to read, "Valid unless 
discharged or released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of continuous active duty 
as of date of note is required."  
Veteran  
subsequently fails to complete 2 years or the full period for which ordered to active duty , or is 
dishonorably discharged,  and is 
no longer eligible … 1. Do not restore entitlement used for a loan 
while in service or allow the use of any remaining entitlement. (IRRRLs do not require restoration or updated proof of eligibility.  Therefore, the Veteran  may still 
obtain an IRRRL).  
2. Do not ret urn any COE received for updating 
or with a restoration request. 
3. Notify the Veteran  in writing of the reason for 
lost eligibility, including information on 
appeal rights.

f. Exception 3: 
Compensable 
SCD An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirement to warrant the c ompensable SCD  exception.  
 This exception appli es when an enlistee was discharged for reasons other  than 
a SCD , but was later determined to have a compensable SCD . 
 
 Example 1:  Warren enlisted in 1999, and was discharged for failing to meet 
physical standards 15 months later.  He was later determined to have a 
compensable SCD .  Warren is eligible.  
  
 Example 2:  Franklin enlisted in 1986 , and served 63 days before being 
discharg ed due to an erroneous entry.  He was later determined to have a 
compensable SCD.  Franklin is not eligible since he did not meet the 90 day 
(war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) requirement.  
  
 Example 3:  Clarabelle enlisted in the Na tional Guard and completed 4 years 
of creditable service.  As per her NGB  22, she was discharged due to a SCD .  
She never served on active duty, and was never activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders.  Clarabelle is eligible since she 
was specifically discharged  from the 
Guard due to a SCD . 
  
 Example 4 : Jasper enlisted in the National Guar d and was discharged after 3  
years due to a lack of participation. Subsequent to his discharge, he was awarded a compensable SCD claim. Jasper is not eligible since he was not 
discharged due to a SCD . 
  
 Example 5:  Elton served 12 days in the Air Force.  As per the narrative on his 
DD-214, Elton was discharged due to a personality disorder.  He was 
subsequently awarded a 100 percent  rating from  VA for a  SCD  related to the 
personality disorder.  This should be referred to the VSC to determine whether 
he could have been discharged for a SCD .

4: Early Out  An early -out discharge under 10 U.S.C. 1171 is available only:  
• To enlisted persons, w ithin 3 months before expiration of the term of 
enlistment or extended enlistment.  
• Does not apply to Public Health Service (PHS) or National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  since only officers serve in 
these organizations. 
• ADSM with an early -out discharge  after serving 21 months of a 3- year 
enlistmen t does not meet the requirement, and  
• ADSM with an  early -out discharge  after 21 months served of a 2- year 
enlistment must fall under this exception to be eligible.  
 
 Qualifying reasons include:  
• Overseas Returnee,  
• Separation from medical holding detachment , 
• Acceptance into ROTC , 
• Secretarial Authority , 
• Released within 3 months of End of Active Obligated Service , 
• To accept reserve commission , and 
• Non-retention on active duty . 
 
 Example 1:  Gus enlisted in 1984 , for 2 years.  He was discharged 22 months 
later under Secretarial Authority.  Gus had evidence that his en listment period 
was 2 years. Gus is eligible.  
  
 Example 2:  Derek enlisted in 1992 , for 3 years.  He was discharged after 23 
months so he could accept a reserve commission.  Though he completed more 
than 21 months of service, Derek is not eligible since his enlistment term was 
greater than 2 years.

h. Exception 
5: 
Convenience of the Government 
(COG ) This exception applies to Army Veteran s who served at least 20 months of a 2 -
year enlistment.   Veterans who enlisted for ONLY 2 years  can use this 
exception .  If the e nlistment was for a longer period, the Veteran  cannot use 
the exception.   The Veteran must provide  evidence of the 2- year enlistment.  
 
Veteran s who were discharged for a qualifying COG reason prior to the 24 
month mark are in this category.  Be sure to review the  DD- 214 narrative.  
Qualifying reasons include:  
• COG, 
• Parenthood,  
• Separation to attend training , 
• Surviving son or daughter , and  
• Army Veteran s discharged for body fat or weight control failure may 
utilize the COG exception provided they meet the COG requirements  
(Army only) . 
 
Note:  A discharge for pregnancy is not the same as a discharge for 
parenthood.  
  
i. Exception 6: 
Reduction in Force  (RIF)  An ADSM  must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirement to warrant the RIF exception.  
 A RIF discharge is the result of a reduction in the size of the military.  
 The RIF discharge must have been involuntary.  The discharge is presumed to have been involuntary unless documentation indi cates otherwise.  
 Qualifying DD-214  narratives include:  
• Reduction in Force , 
• Strength Reduction, and  
• Early Transition .

j. Exception 7: 
Hardship  An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirem ent to warrant the hardship exception. 
 
Ideally, box 25 of the DD- 214 should indicate one of the following:  
• 10 U.S.C. 1173, 
• ARMY 635 -200 Ch6, 
• USAF 36- 3208 Sect 3c , 
• NAVY 1910 -110 or 3620210, or  
• USMC Article 6407. 
 If box 25 does not reflect any of the above references, refer the case to local station management for determination.  
 Qualifying DD-214 narratives include:  
• Hardship,  
• Dependency , 
• Sole parent , and  
• Humanitarian . 
  
k. Exception 8: 
EPTS  An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirement to warrant the EPTS exception. 
 EPTS does not include a failure to meet physical standards.  A physical standards failure can occur at any time during a Veteran ’s career.  Typically, 
such a designation reflects an inability to pass a physical fitness test.    
Qual ifying DD-214 narratives  include existing  prior to service , and f ailure to 
meet procur ement medical fitness standards.  Medical fitness standards failure 
indicates the Veteran  did not meet the minimum qualifications for enlistment, 
and that the medical reason for such failure was  not discovered until after the 
date the Veteran  was sworn into service.

8: EPTS  
(continued)  Example 1:  Mervin enlisted in 1993, and served 120 days.  Mervin was 
discharged for a condition that existed prior to service.  Since Mervin 
completed more than 90 days of service during wartime, he is eligible. 
 
Example 2: Archibald enlisted in 1982, and was discharged after 150 days for failing to pass the physical fitness test.  Archibald is not eligible since he was discharged for failing to meet the physical fitness standards of his branch, 
not because of a medical reason.  
  
l. Exception 9 : 
CIWD An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirement to warrant the CIWD exception.  
 The CIWD discharge is the result of a physical or
 medical condition that was 
not characterized as a disability, but did interfere with the performance of duty.   
 
By definition, CIWD reasons are not disabilities. The DD- 214 narrative may 
directly state ‘Condition Interfered With Duty’ or may instead only reflect the 
actual condition.

l. Exception 9: 
CIWD, 
(continued)  Qualifying DD-214  narratives may include , but are  not limited to:  
• Condition Interfered With Duty , 
• Medical condition, not a disability , 
• Physical condition, not a disability , 
• Personality disorder , 
• Failure to medically qualify for flight training , 
• Chronic airsickness , 
• Chronic seasickness , 
• Enuresis , 
• Sleepwalking , 
• Dyslexia , 
• Severe nightmares , 
• Claustrophobia , and  
• Disability without severance pay . 
 
The subsequent award of a  SCD rating by VA does not alter the discharge 
status of a Veteran  who was discharged due to a CI WD reason.  The Veteran  
must still meet the LOS requirements established for the CIWD exception. 
 
 Example:  Rudolph was discharged after 21 days due to sleepwalking.  He was 
later awarded SCD compensation by VA for an injury incurred when he 
walked into a door while sleepwalking.  Rudolph is not eligible for the CIWD 
exception because he did not meet the LOS  requirement, nor was he eligible 
based upon the SCD  rating by  VA.  The military discharged Rudolph because 
of the condition, not because of a disability.  
  
m. Exception 
10: Expiration of Term of Service  A person must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirement to warrant the Expiration of Term of Service exception.  
 
A DD- 214 narrative that states ‘Expiration of Term of Service’ indicates the 
Veteran  completed the full term which he or she was ordered to active duty. 
This typica lly applies to Activated Guard / Reserve personnel (must have been 
activated under Title 10 U.S.C.  and not in a training capacity).

m. Exception 
10: Expiration 
of Term of 
Service,  
(continued ) This exception can also apply to an ADSM and it do es not require evidence of 
a 2-year enlistment.  
 
Qualifying DD-214  narratives include:  
• Expiration of Term of Service , 
• Completion of Required Active Service, and  
• Release Due to Demobilization . 
 
 Example 1 : Abner was a National Guardsman who was activated under Title 
10 U.S.C . orders in  2007.  He served for 11 months  and was discharged.  His 
DD-214 narrative indicated he was released due to a demobilization of his 
unit. Abner  is eligible since he served 90 or more  days in wartime and 
completed the time for which he was ordered to active duty.  
  
 Example 2 : Stanley was a National Guardsman who was activated under Title 
10 U.S.C . orders in 2004.  He served for 13 months in Iraq, and was 
discharged.  His DD -214 narrative indicated he was released due to 
misconduct.  Stanley is not eligible since he did not complete the term of required service.  Note that his 90 or more  days of ser vice in Iraq did not make 
Stanley eligible.  
  
 Example 3:  Fenwick’s DD-214 reflects 1 year, 11 months of active duty 
service commencing in 1986.  The narrative states “Completion of Required Active Service”.  Though Fenwick did not complete the requisite  24 months, 
he is eligible since he completed the full term for which he was ordered to 
active duty.  
  
n. Exception 
11: Sole 
Survivor   A person must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum 
LOS  requirement to warrant the Expiration of Term of Service exception.  
 
The narrative of a DD -214 may provide the following language: Veteran  was 
discharged or released from a period of active duty of 90 days or more by 
reason of a sole survivorship discharg e.

• This section has been updated to re -number the topics and place R/NG 
exception under Topic 8.  
  
a. Exception 
for R/NG  The R/NG only has one exc eption for completion of the 6 -year LOS 
requirement.   
  
b. Exception 
1: Discharge 
for a  SCD A discharge for a SCD is the only exception for R/NG members.  
 
The Veteran must have been discharged or released specifically due to the SCD.  
If the Veteran was discharged or released from service for a reason other than a SCD, this exception does not apply.  
 The subsequent awarding of SCD compensation by VA is not evidence that a Veteran was discharged due to a SCD, regardless of the percentage of the rating.  
 DD-214  or NGB 22 Narrative may include:  
• Discharge for SCD,  
• Disability with severance pay,  
• Disability without severance pay,  
• Disability – Retired list, and  
• Temporary Disability Retired List.  
 
 Example 1:  Rhonda  was injured on h er second day of training  while on active 
duty.  The injury was determined to be service -connected and resulted in h er 
discharge for disability.  Rhonda is eligible.

Change Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  
• This section has been updat ed to re -number the topic and move an example 
from R/NG COS to Active Duty Servicemember COS.  
  
a. Active Duty 
Servicemember 
COS  
Requirements  A Veteran  must complete at least one satisfactory period of service to be 
deemed eligible.  If a Veteran  is discharged with an unsatisfactory COS , but 
had a previous or subsequent tour that was satisfactory, the Veteran  may 
still qualify using the satisfactory tour.  For enlisted Service members, a 
reenlistment or extension will satisfy that the COS  was satis factory.  
 An acceptable COS  includes:  
• Honorable , 
• General , and  
• Under Honorable Conditions . 
 Note:  The Department of D efense ( DOD)  is responsible for annotating the 
discharge status on the DD -214 (or other separating documentation).   
Based on  exper ience, ea ch Secretary for DOD may use different language to 
represent  the discharge status for a Veteran .  VA employees making 
eligibility determinations should pay close attention to the description of a Veteran s’ COS  to ensure compliance with VA requirements.    
 
Example : Phillip enlisted in 1984, and served in the Navy for 2 years.  At 
the end of his tour, he reenlisted for another 2 years.  Up to the point of reenlistment, Phillip’s service was satisfactory.  6 months after  Phillip      
re-enlisted , he was subjected to a court martial.  Phillip was ultimately 
discharged under a Dishonorable COS.  Even though Phillip was discharged under dishonorable conditions, Phillip is eligible based upon the completion 
of his first satisfactory 24 -month tour.

b. R/NG COS 
Requirements  If discharged, R/NG members must have received an Honorable discharge for 
their reserve service.  A discharge of General, Under Honorable Conditions, 
Under Other Than Honorable Conditions, Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable is not acceptable.  If the member is still actively participating, no COS determination is required.  
An Honorable COS must be provided for each separate tour or component.  If an R/NG member has a gap in tours with the same component, or changes components, each separate tour must be qualified in order for it to count toward the 6- year requirement. Care must be taken to ensure that a document 
that evidences a COS applies to the period o f service in question. 
  
c. Acceptable 
Forms of Verification  A Veteran  or Servicemember ’s COS  is a critical element  in the determination 
of eligibility for the home loan benefit.  Each classification  of a Veteran  or 
Servicemember  may have alternative forms of documentation that 
demonstrate an acceptable COS  during a period of military service.  
Following are a list of acceptable alternative forms of verification for each classification of Veteran  or Servicemember :  
 
Service  Forms o f Verification  
ADSM  DD-214 
 Statement of Service Letter  
 VIS – Veteran  information solution: may be used

d. Subsequent 
Discharge  If the Veteran  is later discharged prior to completing the minimum LOS 
required for the era of service, or is discharged under Other Than Honorable, Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable conditions, the Veteran  is no longer eligible.  
 Do note that a COS  that is Other than Honor able or Bad Conduct will be 
submitted to a VSC for review in order to determine if an upgrade to an acceptable COS  can be made.  
 
 Example : Mike enlisted in 1992 , and served 90 days on active duty.  At that 
point , he became eligible and used his home loan benefit.  However, he was 
discharged for misconduct after having served just 18 months.  His COS  was 
Under Honorable Conditions.  Therefore, while Mike was once eligible and received a valid COE, he is no longer eligible since he did not complete the 
requi red 24 months of service.

b. Bonus 
Entitlement  Bonus entitlement is a fluctuating amount, and may only be changed by  
Congressional action.  The exact amount of the bonus entitlement that is available depends on the county where the subject property is located.  The bonus entitlement is $68,250 and an y loan amount made using this authority 
must exceed $144,000.  VA allows for a greater loan limit when the subject property is located within a high- cost county, which in turn has the effect of 
increasing the amount of entitlement that a Veteran  has available.   
 The level of bonus entitlement for non- high cost areas is set at $68,250, 
which provides for a full guaranty on additional financing up to $273,000 (68,250 x 4 = $273,000). When coupled with the base entitlement, the bonus entitlement provides for a combined entitlement of $104,250, which translates 
into a maximum guaranteed loan amount of $417,000 ( $144,000 + $273,000 
= $417,000).    
 
The lev el of bonus entitlement in high- cost areas is set  at 25  percent  of the 
loan limit amount in the county.  The maximum guaranty amount will be based on the One -Unit (single -family residence) limit, as prescribed by the 
Federal Housing Finance Agency.

• This section has been updated to re -number the Topic , reformat  and add 
closing disclosure as an acceptable document for proof that the property 
disposal .  
  
a. General 
Rule for 
Restoration of Entitlement  In order to restore the entitlement that was used to obtain a current or prior 
VA-guaranteed loan, at least one  of the following four sets of conditions must 
be satisfied:  
 
DISPOSAL AND REPAYMENT   
• The property which secured the old VA loan has been disposed of by 
the Veteran  or has been destroye d by fire or other natural hazard, and  
• The loan has been paid -in-full, or if VA has suffered a loss on the loan, 
the loss has been paid -in-full, or VA has been released from liability as 
guarantor or insurer . 
 
REFINANCE   
• The old VA loan has been paid -in-full (or will be paid-in-full by the 
new loan) ,  
• The Veteran  will be using his or her entitlement to obtain a new loan 
secured by the same property which secured the VA loan paid -in-full, 
and 
• The new loan will refinance a mortgage or other lien on the property.  
 ONE -TIME RESTORATION   
The old VA loan has been paid -in-full, but the property securing it has not 
been dispose d of (and the conditions for REFINANCE above are not met).  
These conditions of restoration can be used by the Veteran  one time on ly
.  
After such use, any  future restoration will require the Veteran  to dispose of all 
property previously financed with a VA loan.  
 SUBSTITUTION OF ENTITLEMENT   
A qualified Veteran  has agreed to assume the loan and substitute his or her 
entitlement for that of the Veteran  whose entitlement is currently tied to the 
loan.

b. Specifics on 
"Disposal and 
Repayment"  The following chart explains restoration under "Disposal and Repayment" 
conditions in further detail. 
 
Issue  Explanation  
Timing  The timing of the disposal of the property and repayment 
of the loan does not matter; either can occur before or 
after the other, or at the same time,  as long as both have 
occurred prior to restoration.  
Disposal  Disposal includes either:  
• Sale of the property, including sale by assumption, or 
sale by installment sales contract, under which the 
Veteran  retains legal title to the property subject to 
the right of the purchaser to  acquire legal title upon 
satisfying all contract te rms (the loan paid -in-full), or 
• Transfer of the deed (e.g. quit -claim deed).  
 
Proof of 
Disposal  Evidence of disposal:  
• VA Form 26- 1880 : Veteran ’s declaration of 
ownership of property pre viously encumbered by a 
VA loan,  
• Closing disclosure, HUD -1 settlement sta temen t or 
similar documentation, or  
• Warranty deed evidencing transfer of ownership. 
  
Relocation 
Contract  A signed contract  under a company plan to purchase a 
borrower's home when he or she is transferred will meet the disposal requirement  once the loan is paid -in-full.  A 
signed contract alone does not meet the disposal requirement.  Consult local RLC management in such 
cases .

"Disposal and 
Repayment"  
(continued)  Issue  Explanation  
Evidence of 
Loan Payoff  The following are acceptable as conclusive evidence of 
a paid -in-full loan:  
• Evidence in the electronic information systems the 
loan is paid -in-full. 
• Canceled L oan G uaranty C ertificate  or notice from 
the lender.  
• Station's determination that the loan is statistically paid-in-full. 
• Other reliable evidence (e.g. California escrow closing statement, closing disclosure or HUD -1 
settlement statement that clearly indicates payment 
of the loan in full).  
• A cancelled security deed that clearly identifies the 
subject VA loan (VA L oan Identifi cation N umber ), 
or describes the property and loan in sufficient 
detail so as to ensure the deed is for the subject VA 
loan. 
• Contact with the holder confirming paid- in-full 
status . 
• For pri or direct loans; check with the portfolio 
oversight unit . 
 
Note :  
• A credit report entry is not sufficient  evidence a 
loan has been paid -in-full because reporting may 
not show a mortgage not yet reported, but recently 
closed .  
• A warranty deed evidencing property transfer only evidences the conveyance of real property; it does not verify the loan has been paid -in-full. 
• A closing disclosure/ settlement statement must be 
reviewed so as to ensure the VA loan was paid off as part of the transaction, and not merely  assumed 
by the borrower (loan taken ‘subject to’).  
 
Loans Coded 
“Not Reported 
As Active”  Loans coded “Not Reported As Active” may be coded 
as Paid -in-Full.

b. Specifics on 
"Disposal and 
Repayment"  
(continued)   
Issue  Explanation  
Repayment of 
Loss  Entitlement can be restored if:  
• The Government has paid a claim for guaranty or 
insurance and the Veteran  has fully repaid any loss 
incurred by the Government due to such claim payment, OR  
• VA accepted, or authorized the holder to accept, a 
voluntary conveyance of the property (deed- in-lieu 
of foreclosure) and the Veteran  fully repays any loss 
incurred by the Government due to such 
conveyance.  
 
Where a joint loan is involved, the Veteran  must only 
repay his/her portion of the guaranty that was allocated.  
 VA's waiver or compromise of the right to collect indebtedness from the Veteran  does not satisfy this 
requirement, nor does discharge of debt through 
bankruptcy.  Actual repayment of the Government's loss is required for restoration of entitlement.  
 
Release of VA's 
liability  When the Secretary of Defense accepts a conveyance 
and assumes , but does not pay off , the loan, evidence 
that DoD has acquired the property and assumed the loan is construed as releasing VA from liability as 
guarantor or insurer.

Refinance loan is being sought, and the Veteran 
currently has a VA loan on the subject property, OR  
• The Veteran  previously had a VA loan on the subject 
property, and there is currently some type of lien on 
the property.  
 
Designation  VA designates such loans as a ‘Cash -Out Refinance’ 
when cash proceeds are obtained at the closing, or  as a 
‘Regular Refinance, if the borrower does not obtain cash proceeds from the transaction.  ‘Regular Refinance’ is the designation VA uses to describe what the mortgage

c. Specifics on 
Refinance 
(continued)  Issue  Explanation  
Requirements  The Cash -Out or Regular Refinance VA loan must be 
used to refinance either:  
• An existing VA loan , 
• A conventional or FHA loan, or   
• Any other type of lien that is secured by the 
subject property.  
 
A Cash -Out or Regular Refinance can only be 
performed in cases where there is an existing lien on the subject property; if the property is held ‘free & clear’, a VA refinance cannot occur.   There is no seasoning requirement for a lien that is to be paid off with a VA refinance.  
 A Cash -Out or Regular Refinance loan requires the 
borrower to meet all qualifying criteria established for VA purchase loans, to include occupancy requirements.  
The Veteran  must provide a signed certification that the 
property to be refinanced is the same property for which the Veteran  previously used the entitlement to be 
restored.

d. Any Other 
Type of Lien 
That is Secured by the Subject Property
 
   Issue  Explanation  
COE Conditions  The issued COE will contain a condition which states 
that the COE is only valid for a refinance of the subject property.  
 The Veteran  must provide a signed certification that the 
property to be refinanced is the same property for which the Veteran  previously used the entitlement to be 
restored.  
 
IRRRLs  IRRRLs do not require a restoration; therefore, they are 
not within the scope of thi s discussion.  
 
  
e. Restoration 
of Entitlement Examples  The following chart provides examples for restoration of entitlement.  
 
Example 1  Jebediah bought a home in 1985 , using a portion of his 
VA entitlement.  He sold the property and paid his loan in full in 1987.  The entitlement encumbered on Jebediah’s VA loan can be fully restored.  
 
Example 2  Rafael does not sell the subject property, but he does 
execute a quit -claim deed.  He has effectively disposed 
of the property, but the encumbered entitlement cannot be fully res tored until the VA loan is paid- in-full. 
 
Example 3  Jake purchased a property in Memphis using his VA 
entitlement.  Jake lost his property to foreclosure, whereby VA incurred a loss.  Jake cannot obtain a restoration of the entitlement encumbered on the subject property until the loss has been paid -in-full.  However, 
Jake may have the ability to use his remaining entitlement.  
 
Note : The new loan amount and county loan limits 
would both be factors in future eligibility 
considerations .

e. Restoration 
of Entitlement 
Examples  
(continued)  Example 4  Bentley sold his home and allowed Cornelius to assume 
his VA loan.  Cornelius did not substitute entitlement, but he did assume the liability for the loan.  Though Bentley no longer owns the property and is not liable for the loan, his entitlement remains encumbered until the loan has been paid -in-full. 
 
Example 5  - 
Regular/Cash - 
Out Refinance  Sally purchased a home with a VA loan and then 
refinanced the loan with an FHA loan.  She now wants to refinance the same home back to a VA loan.  She can obtain a restoration for refinance only to use with a regular refinance on her existing property.  
 
Example 6  - 
Regular/Cash - 
Out Refinance  John has an existing VA loan and wants to obtain a VA 
cash-out refinancing loan.  He can obtain restoration 
since the requirement for the prior VA loan to be paid-
in-full is considered met when closing of the new loan 
occurs.  
 
Example 7  – 
One-Time 
Restoration  Jody purchased a home with a VA loan using all of her 
entitlement, and then refinanced it to a conventional 
loan.  She now wants to purchase another home to occupy, using a VA loan.  Jody can do so under "one -
time" restoration conditions.  However, she may not be granted restoration again to purchase another home until both of those properties are disposed of and paid -
in-full.   
 
Example 8  - 
Disposal and Repayment  Anthony purchased a home with a VA loan, then sold it 
by assumption and obtained a release of liability , but 
did not obtain a substitution of entitl ement.  The loan 
was subsequently foreclosed, and VA paid a claim to the lender.  No debt/loss was established against Anthony; however, he cannot have the entitlement he originally used to purchase the home restored unless he repays the Government for the  loss incurred.  Anthony 
can use remaining entitlement to purchase another 
property.

f. Waiver of 
Restoration 
Requirements  One or more of the requirements for restoration of entitlement may be waived 
by the Secretary only if the Veteran  was a victim of disastrous circumstances 
caused by conditions beyond his or her control.  "Disastrous" usually pertains to acts of nature.  If  station management believes such action is warranted, 
they must submit the case to CO  Loan Policy for consideration, accompanied 
by a full development of the pertinent facts , emailed to 
LoanPolicy.VBAVACO@va.gov . 
  
g. Procedures 
for Restoration  Process requests for restoration of entitlement as follows:  
 
Step  Action  
1 Process by the RLC or RO of jurisdiction.   
2 Require submission and review of:  
• VA Form 26 -8106 , and  
• VA Form 26 -1880  or electronic application .  
 Supporting documents concerning the Veteran 's service when 
required to substantiate entitlement.  
 For restoration under "refi nance" conditions, also require 
certification that the property to be refinanced is the same as the 
one for which Veteran  used the entitlement to be restored.  
 
3 For insufficient or incomplete applications, request additional 
information using system letters and suspend processing pendi ng 
receipt of requested materials.   
Also, suspend processing if prior eligibility was established while Veteran  was on active duty, Veteran  has since been 
discharged or released, and evidence that service was "other than dishonorable" is needed.  
Do not suspend processing for i ncomplete VA Form 26 -1880
 
when incomplete items are not pertinent to the case.  
4 Determine the status of the previous loan(s).  
5 If restoration is approved, code electronic system and issue  the 
COE.  
6 Send the updated COE and any original discharge or separation 
papers submitted to the Veteran .

 12.  How to Process a Certificate of Eligibility , Continued  
  
c. Steps to 
Process   Appeals are escalated to the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) and BVA is 
responsible for reviewing and making a ruling.  VA CO  does not govern this 
process but, as needed, will serve as a consultant to field offices.  The steps 
below outline how an Appeal of a COE should be received and processed.  
 
Step  Action  
1 RLC receives Notice of Disagreement ( NOD ) and must 
document the date stamp in the notes of when the NOD was first received.  
 
Verify that the NOD is within 1  year of the original denial letter.  
2 Using the reference number and the social security number, 
verify that the Veteran  does not have another reference number 
with relevant information attached.  
3 Verify in VACOLS that no other appeals have been submitted.  
A pending decision may affect a r equest for a COE.   
 
If there is an appeal pending that will affect the COE determination, notify the Veteran  that VA will wait until a 
decision has been made on the previous appeal.  
4 Review NOD.  Upload NOD into WebLGY and verify that the 
NOD indicates  a disagreement with VA’s decision.  
 
If the NOD does not indicate disagreement, notify the Veteran  of 
what is needed and document the system notes.  
5 Determine if the COE can be issued.  If a COE can be issued, do 
not record this as an appeal.   
 
If a C OE cannot be issued, upload the NOD and complete the 
SOC, as required.  
6 Create  the applicable SOC letter.  Mail the final letter to the 
Veteran , including VA Form 646 , Statement of Accredited 
Representative in Appealed Case , and POA ( as necessary ).   
7 Document all action (s) in the necessary system of record  (i.e. 
WebLGY and/or VACOLS) .  
8 If Form 9,  Appeal to Board of Veterans’ Appeal , is received 
within 60- calendar days, Form 8, Certification of Appeal , must 
be completed, VACOLs update d, and the paper appeal file sent 
to BVA with overnight tracking.
