Which \nPublications \nAre Available \nElectronically? VA Pamphlet 26-7, VA Lender’s Handbook, along with H26-94-1, VA \nServicing Guide, are now available elec tronically on the Internet.  Changes to \nthe handbook and Servicing Guide will be  available on the Internet when \nsigned.  Lenders are strongly encouraged to begin accessing these publications electronically.    Excerpts from certain Loan Guaranty circulars  beginning in 1996 are also \navailable electronically.  Circulars contain inform ation about changes to VA \npolicies and/or procedures and informa tion that regional o ffices are required \nto release to lenders and/or servicers in their area.  Circulars, which only \ndiscuss internal VA procedures, are not included. \n \nb. Internet \nAddress The Internet address is: http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/pam26_7.html.   \n \nc. Commercial \nServices There are also commercial services di stributing VA documents electronically.  \nFor example, the Mortgage Resource Center (800-848-4904)  offers them on \ndiskettes for those without access to the Internet as we ll as over the Internet \n(http://www.allregs.com ).  They can notify lenders  by electronic mail when \nlender’s handbook chan ges or circulars are issued. \n \n \n      \n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-3 2.  Misleading Advertisements \n \nChanged Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 \nThis section has been chan ged to create subsection letterin g.  \n \na. Policy The Department of Veterans Affairs alwa ys strives to provide all veterans the \nmost up-to-date and pertinent informati on about their benefits.  Toward that \nend, all appropriate efforts by lenders to  further educate or  remind veterans \nabout their home loan benefit and the lende r’s availability to assist the veteran \nin obtaining the benefit is appreciated.  However, it is inappropriate to direct \nany information about benefits to vete rans which is in any way misleading. \n It must be clearly understood that VA has a very specific mission to serve \nveterans, who are declared by Congress to be a “special cla ss of citizen,” and \nveterans rely on VA to provide dependa ble service and reli able information \nconcerning their benefits.    Any action on the part of lenders or  other program pa rticipants which \njeopardizes VA’s credibility with veterans  or induces veterans to obtain loans \nwhich are clearly not in their best inte rests would be viewed by VA as actions \nwhich are detrimental to the best interest s of veterans.  If such a determination \nis made, grounds for suspension from participation in the VA Loan Guaranty Pro\ngram could be established. \n \nb. Examples Example 1 : \n In increasing numbers, VA has been rece iving inquiries and complaints from \nveterans concerning advertisements and solicitations they have received from \nlenders which state that VA has a new program to refinance their VA loan \nand lower their interest rate, an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL).    The IRRRL program has been available to veterans since the enactment of \nThe Veterans’ Disability Compensati on and Housing Benefits Amendments \nof 1980 ( Public Law 96-385 ).   \n \nIn addition, many of these solicitation s suggest that the lender has some \nspecial relationship with VA that enables only them to offer this loan \nopportunity.  Some even clearly attemp ts to give the impression that the \n“letter” the veteran received came from VA. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-4 2.  Misleading Advertisements, Continued \n  \nb. Examples \n(continued)  Example 2 : \nAnother unacceptable advertising approach that some lenders have been using is to invite veterans to “skip” payments  and refinance their loan.  It generally \ngives the appearance that VA condones sk ipping payments and rolling them \ninto the new IRRRL. This is not the case.    It is irresponsible to s uggest to any mortgagor that  this program encourages \nskipping payments, or that this is an  appropriate means of getting around the \nprohibition against receiving cash from the transaction.   \n Any advertising that promotes skippi ng payments as a means of obtaining \ncash for other purposes is unacceptable. \n \nc. Lender \nResponsibility VA encourages all lenders to continue offering VA financi ng to all eligible \nand qualified veterans, and it is r ecognized that mortgage lending is a \ncompetitive industry.  However, VA insi sts that lenders refrain from any and \nall practices which might mislead veterans  into actions which are contrary to \ntheir own best interests.    If your firm has been engaging in such advertising, or is considering doing so, \nVA strongly recommends that  anything in your promoti onal material which is \nin any way inaccurate or misleading be deleted.  If there is uncertainty about \nthe accuracy or propriety of the adver tisement or solicitation, please consult \nwith the appropriate local VA office or  the Loan Policy staff at VA Central \nOffice at (202) 273-7368. \n \nd. Sanctions Sanctions of program participants for viol ations of regulations  are set forth in \n38 CFR part 44 .   Refer to Chapter 17  for additional info rmation on sanctions \nof program participants.  \n[Public Law 96-385]  \n \n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-5 3.  Automated Underwriting \n \nChanged Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 \n This section has been changed to  create subsec tion lettering. \n Subsection a has been changed to ad d a reference to the Zippy program. \n Subsection c’s reference to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s automated \nunderwriting systems has been changed to “provider of these systems.”  \nThis chan ge is due to the increase in the number of approved s ystems. \n \na. General VA has approved the use of several au tomated underwriting systems.  The \nsystems are  \n Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector , \n Fannie Mae’s DU , \n Countrywide’s CLUES System , and \n Chase’s Zippy  \n \nNote :  The Chase and Countrywide system s may only be used in connection \nwith their loans.  \n The systems are only for use by VA automatic lenders, and only on loans \neligible for automa tic processing.   \n These systems assign a risk classifica tion which determines the level of \nunderwritin\ng and documentation needed. \n \nb. Lender \nResponsibility The automated systems do not approve or  disapprove loans.   They merely \ndetermine a risk classifica tion.  It is still the lende r’s decision whether or not \nto approve the loan.    Lenders are still responsible for meeting all VA requirements for all  loans; \nhowever they may take advantage of certain documentation waivers based on \nthe risk classification. \n \nc. VA’s Role Although VA has approved the use of thes e systems, we are not the vendor. \nThe terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider \nof these s ystems. \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-6 4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) \n \nChanged Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 \nThis section has been chan ged to create subsection letterin g.  \n \na. \nCompatibility \nof VA Program \nwith HMDA As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  (HMDA) data, \nmany lenders are increasingl y concerned that they ar e taking all appropriate \nmeasures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to home mortgage loans.  VA believes that  it is important for lenders to be \naware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in \nmeeting this goal.  The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for \nindividuals with low-to-m oderate incomes.  Howe ver, lenders should not \noverlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans \nfor such applicants.  The “VA Credit St andards” are written as guidelines and \nare meant to be interprete d and used just that way,  taking into consideration \nall of an individual loan applicant’ s financial, employment and family \ncircumstances.    This topic provides guidance on area s of underwriting that may be of \nparticular concern when processing app lications for low-to-moderate income \nborrowers.  Many of the concepts are discussed in Chapter 4 , Credit \nUnderwriting, but are repeated here to emphasize their importance and \napplicability to underwriti ng loans to minority and low-to-moderate income \napplicants. \n \nb. Purpose This topic in the “VA Lender's Ha ndbook” is intended to encourage \nunderwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be \napproved but may not appear  approvable upon direct a pplication of the credit \nstandards.  The examples discussed are certainly not all in clusive, but they \nshould help the underwriter recognize th at there are those whose lifestyle, \nminority status, or location require cons ideration of extraordinary, yet valid, \nfactors in the underwriting process in order to find a ba sis for correctly \nmaking an approval decision.  Underwriters are encouraged to gi ve consideration to every possible \nappropriate factor in se eking a proper basis for a pproving loan applications \nfor ever\ny qualified veteran. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-7 4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Continued \n  \nc. Use of VA \nPrior Approval \nProcedure Although lenders that have automatic au thority should use that authority to \nthe maximum extent possible, another important tool available to lenders \nseeking to increase credit access by minor ity and lower income borrowers is \nthe optional use of VA’s prio r-approval processing.   \n Loan applications that may not be  clearly approvable under VA’s published \ncredit standards but which, in the lender’s view, contain compensating \nstrengths, may be sent to VA on the pr ior-approval basis.  Lenders should \nsubmit an explanation as to why the lo an was not closed automatically and \npoint out the reasons wh\ny they believe the loan ma y be approvable. \n \nd. Employment \nand Income \nStability A borrower’s employment and income st ability are vital to the underwriting \nof a loan.  There are characteristics  that should be considered when \nunderwriting loans for low-to-moderate  income borrowers when evaluating \nacceptable employment and income.  Changing of Jobs  \nIt is possible to establish stable  and reliable income without having \nestablished a stable empl oyment history in one position or job.  It is not \nunusual for some borrowers to  change jobs frequently, even changing lines of \nwork.  The borrower may be simply going where there is available work.  To \nestablish stability and co ntinuance of income, the borrower must demonstrate \nthe ability to maintain an income at a constant level over the recent 2-year \nperiod even if he or she has wo rked for a variety of employers. \n Part-Time Employment  \nIt is not uncommon for people with limited income from their primary \nemployment to take on part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Ideally \nthe borrower should show a two-year hist ory, but one year may be considered \nfor an otherwise strong borrower.  Underw riters must review such income for \nprobable continuance and tr y to assure that the part-time employment is \nreasonable and sustainable.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-8 4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Continued \n  \nd. Employment \nand Income \nStability (continued)  Periods of Unemployment  \nIn parts of the country, it is not unus ual for some indivi duals to work for \ncertain times of the year and draw unemployment for the remainder of the \nyear (such as field workers).  A peri od or periods of une mployment will not \nautomatically be considered unfavor ably, provided the unemployment is \nregular and seasonal, or is a li mited occurrence between jobs, and \nunemployment compensation has been r eceived during those periods.  If the \napplicant has a history of such an income pattern, unemployment \ncompensation as well as income receiv ed during periods of employment may \nbe used when calculatin g an individual’s income for loan approval purposes. \n  \ne. Source of \nFunds to Close Another area where low-to-moderate income borrowers sometimes differ \nfrom others is the source of funds to close loans.  It is not unusual or \nunacceptable for some borrowers to save money at home versus using depositories.  In order to be acceptable,  a reasonable explanation of how the \nborrower saved the funds should be provided. \n \nf. Credit \nHistory In the area of credit, the lack of an established credit history should not be a \ndeterrent to loan approval.  As provided in the credit standards, a satisfactory \npayment history on items such as rent, util ities, phone bills, etc., may be used \nto establish a satisfactor y credit histor y. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-9 4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Continued \n  \ng. Consider All \nFactors As stated in the credit standards, no  single factor is a determinant in any \napplicant’s qualification fo r a VA-guaranteed loan. \n \n A veteran who has maintained an ex cellent credit history, (such as \nsatisfactory payment of a shelter ex pense comparable to the proposed \nshelter expense) may be approvable in  spite of shortfall in the residual \nincome.  In such an instance, it might  be appropriate to consider that the \nveteran has established a lifestyle which is substantially different from the average used in establishing the residual income tables in the credit standards. \n A veteran with a good credit record who meets the residual income \nguideline (without exceeding it by 20 per cent) may be appr ovable in spite \nof a high debt-to-income ratio if the proposed shelter expense is not \nsignificantly greater than the amount th e veteran has been accustomed to \npaying. \n \nh. \nCompensating Factors The use of compensating factors is en couraged for marginally approvable VA \nloans, and a detailed explanation of  their use in underwriting loans is \nprovided in the credit standards.    A compensating factor that has come into  play quite recently is the numerous \nfinancial and homeownership coun seling programs being provided by a \nvariety of sources including banks, mo rtgage lenders, and community groups.  \nThese counseling programs are designed to  help applicants work out payment \nplans for old debts, design savings pl ans, and teach basic budgeting skills.  \nPrograms often include homebuyer e ducation lessons and post-closing \ncounseling to assist the new homeowners once the loan is made.  Participation \nby an applicant in such a counseling program can be viewed as a strong \ncompensating factor for a case in which it is otherwise difficult to conclude \nthat a borrower is qualified under a trad itional interpretati on of the credit \nstandards. \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 20 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-10 5.  VA Restructuring of th e Loan Processing Function \n \nChanged Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 \n This section has been changed to  create subsec tion lettering.  \n Subsection a has been created by comb ining the two previous subsections \ninto one.  This new subsection encour ages lenders to use their automatic \nauthority in every possible instance before submitting a loan to VA for \nunderwritin g. \n \na. Use of Prior \nApproval Processing by Automatic Lenders Lenders with automatic authority must use their automatic authority in every \npossible instance before submitting a lo an to VA for underwriting on the prior \napproval basis.   \n Except for cases specifica lly precluded from automa tic processing, such as \njoint loans, the only cases lenders should consider  submitting to VA for prior \napproval are those in which the underwr iter firmly believes approval can be \njustified.  However, the specific facts of the case appear to preclude approval.  \nIn such instances, the underwriter must include:  \n a detailed explanation of why the lo an should be approved by VA, plus \n a thorough justification for not approving the loan on the automatic basis.   \n It will not be sufficient to justify submitting the loan to VA solely to comply \nwith the veteran’s or the real estate a\ngent’s request to do so. \n \n\n--- PAGE 21 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nCurrent Issues  \nCI-11 6.  Modified Guaranty  Submission Procedure  \n \nChanged Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 \n This section has been changed to  create subsec tion lettering.  \n Subsection a added a reference to the Automated Certificate of Eligibility, \ndeleted references to obsolete funding fee forms and updated the \n“Certificate of Reasonable Va lue” to ‘Notice of Value.” \n Subsections a and b have been ch anged to correct typographical and \ngrammatical errors.  Changes have been highlighted.   \n Subsection c has been chan ged to provide the subsection reference. \n \na. What must \nLenders Submit? Lenders must submit copies (except for the COE, which must be an original) \nof the items below in the order listed , to VA when requesting guaranty for all \nloans except Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs).  There are \nno changes to IRRRL procedur es for requesting guaranty. \n 1. VA Form 26-0286, Loan Summary Sheet  \n \n2.

Lender Any person or entity (private sector or government) that originates, holds, \nservices, funds, bu ys, sells or otherwise transfers a loan guaranteed b y VA. \n  \nb. Supervised \nLender A lender that is subject to mandatory periodic examinati on and supervision by \nan agency of the United States or of  any State or terr itory, including the \nDistrict of Columbia.  VA determines whether the level of examination and supervision to which a lender is subject satisfies the requirement.  Examples of supervised lenders include:  \n Financial institutions which are members of the Federal Reserve System, \n Financial institutions whose accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration \n(NCUA), \n Financial institutions which are members of the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, \n Federal Savings Banks, \n National Banks, \n Farm Credit System Institutions, \n State Chartered Banks, \n Insurance Companies, \n Credit Unions, \n Savings and Loan Associations, and \n Private banks. \n \nA state actin\ng as a lender is also considered supervised. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 26 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1:  Lender Approval Guidelines  \n \n1-3 \n 1.

Non- \nsupervised Automatic Lender A lender who has applied for authority to close loans on an automatic basis \nand has been formally gran ted such authority by VA. \n  \ne. Agent An Agent may also be referred to as a Mortgage Broker. An Agent is a person \nor entity that performs any activity on behalf of , or in the name of, a \nsponsorin g lender.   \n  \nf. Sponsoring \nLender A lender that uses an agent to perform any portion of the work involved in \noriginating and closing a VA-guaranteed loan is the “sponsoring lender” for \nthat a gent. \n  \ng. Mergers and \nAcquisitions Lender mergers and acquisitions are disc ussed in section 8 of this chapter. \n \nh. Prior \nApproval A Prior Approval lender is neither a s upervised or non-supervised automatic \nlender.  All prior approval loans must  be submitted to VA for underwriting \nand approval prior to closing the loan.  \n All lenders, whether or not th ey have automatic authority, must  submit the \nfollowing types of loans to  VA for prior approval: \n \n Joint loans (Veteran/Veteran  or Veteran/non-Veteran). \n Loans to Veterans in receipt of  VA nonservice-connected pension. \n Loans to Veterans with a VA appointed fiduciary.  \n Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs) made to refinance \ndelinquent VA loans. \n Manufactured home loans (except when the manufactured home is \npermanently affixed to the lot and considered real estate under state law) \nunless the lender has been separate ly approved for this purpose. \n Unsecured loans or loans secured b\ny less than a first lien. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 27 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1: Lender Approval Guidelines \n1-4 1.  Definitions and Authorities, continued \n  \nh. Prior \nApproval, continued Lenders with automatic authority may also elect  to submit a loan (of a type \nnot on the above list) for pr ior approval when issues or circumstances cannot \nbe resolved by the lend er’s own underwriting st aff (see section 5 of Current \nIssues ). \n \n The submission must include the underwr iter’s analysis a nd explanation of \nwhy it is being submitte d for prior approval.  \n Do not use this provision to shift the burden of a loan rejection to VA. \n \nLenders without automatic authority must submit a ll loans to VA for prior \napproval except IRRRLs made to refinance VA loans that are not delinquent. \n \ni. Automatic \nAuthority  (Authority to \nClose Loans on \nan Automatic Basis) Automatic authority is authority for a lender to close VA-guaranteed loans \nwithout the prior approval of VA.  Le nders with automatic authority should \nuse it to the maximum extent possible.  The following lenders have automatic \nauthority:  \n all supervised lenders, \n certain non-supervised lenders who a pply for and are gr anted automatic \nauthority by VA, and \n any lender (even a lender who does not otherwise have automatic authority) \nfor the limited purpose of closing an  IRRRL, as long as the loan being \nrefinanced is not delinquent. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 28 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1:  Lender Approval Guidelines  \n \n1-5 \n 1.

Supervised \nVersus Non-supervised Automatic Lenders A non-supervised lender that wishes to close loans on an automatic basis must \nobtain both VA authorization for auto matic authority and obtain VA approval \nof other elements of its automatic lending operations (that is, underwriter \napproval).  This difference between supe rvised and non-supervised lenders is \noutlined below.  \nAuthority Supervised Lender Non-supervised Automatic \nLender \nTo close loans on the automatic \nbasis No VA approval needed. Must submit application and be \nauthorized by VA to close loans on an automatic basis. \nTo use certain underwriters No VA approval needed.  \nAny of the lender’s \nunderwriters may underwrite loans processed on the automatic basis. Must submit application and \nobtain VA approval for each person to underwrite VA loans processed on the automatic basis. \nTo close loans in particular states  No VA approval needed. \nLender may close loans in any state.  No VA approval needed. Lender \nmay close loans in any state.   \nTo use agents to process VA loans Must submit request and \nobtain VA recognition of each agent with whom the lender has an on\ngoing relationship. Must submit request and obtain \nVA recognition of each agent with whom the lender has an ongoing relationship.  \n \n \nk. IRRRL \nException IRRRLs, except those intended to refi nance delinquent VA loans, can be \nclosed automatically by any lender in any state w ithout specific approval of \nautomatic authority, underwriters, or the state in which the loan is made.  Use \nof agents to process IRRRLs is subjec t to the same requi rements as agents \nprocessin g other t ypes of loans (see Topic 7 of this chapte r). \n \n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1: Lender Approval Guidelines \n1-6 2.

Sending the \nInitial \nInformation \nPackage to VA This section applies to all lenders (s upervised, non-supervis ed automatic, and \nprior approval). \n First-time VA lenders must send the certain information to the VA Regional \nLoan Center (RLC) or the Honol ulu Regional Office according to \njurisdiction.  A complete  list may be found at: \nhttp://www.benefits.va.gov/hom eloans/contact_rlc_info.asp . The information \nthat should be sent includes:  \n specimen signatures of all officers,  underwriters, or other personnel \nauthorized to sign documents relate d to VA-guaranteed loan activities, \n VA Form 26-8812 , VA Equal Opportunity Lender Certification , and \n a letter identifying the lender’s corpor ate address, the le nder’s owners, any \nlending personnel or officers that VA or HUD ever debarred or took other \nadverse action against, and a list of all the lender’s branch offices that are \ninvolved in VA mortgage lending. \n In addition, VA may, at its discretion, or der a credit report on  a lender and/or \ninterview principal officers. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1:  Lender Approval Guidelines  \n \n1-7 \n 2.  Before a Lender Starts Making Loans, continued \n  \nb. What \nHappens Next? The VA RLC of jurisdiction will provide information to the lender, including \ntraining on VA loan processing, and a VA ID number to use for all VA \nlending transactions and documents as  an identifier of the lender. \n The lender may download a copy of this VA Pamphlet 26-7, Lender’s \nHandbook, at http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/pam26_7.html . \n To receive new lender information from  the VA, including updates to this \nmanual, the lender will need to  sign up for GovDelivery at \nhttps://public.govdelivery.c om/accounts/USVAVBA/subs criber/new?preferen\nces=true.  \n The VA RLC of jurisdiction will serve as the lender’s primary contact point with VA.  Please direct all  technical questions, re quests for training, or \nrequests for VA publications and materials to that office. \n As soon as a lender becomes familia r with the laws, regulations, and \nprocedures pertaining to VA-guarant eed loans, it may begin making VA \nloans.  A non-supervised lender must submit a ll loans except certain IRRRLs to VA \nfor prior approval, unless the lender  applies for, and receives, specific \nauthority from VA to close loans on the automatic basis.  A lender supervised by one of the Federal entities described in Topic 3 of this \nchapter can begin closing loans on the automatic basis immediately. \n A lender that must submit a request to VA for recognition as supervised must \nsubmit all loans except certain IRRRLs to VA for prior approval until it receives recognition as supervised.

Lenders That are Considered Supervised \n \nChange Date February 1, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n  \na. Supervision \nby Certain Federal Entities VA considers any lender subject to mandatory periodic examination and \nsupervision by any of the following Fe deral entities to be supervised: \n \n The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n The Comptroller of the Currency \n The National Credit Union Administration \n The Farm Credit Administration \n \nLenders supervised by these Federal en tities are not required to request \nrecognition from VA.  Indicate which of the above  Federal entities supervises  the lender in the initial \ninformation package submitted to VA.  If VA needs clarification of the lender’s status, VA will request appropriate documentation from the lender. \n \nb. \nCircumstances \nunder which VA \nRecognition as Supervised is Needed These instructions apply to a lender that wishes to be recognized as a \nsupervised lender by VA, but is not directly supervised by one of the Federal entities listed in Topic 3, Subsection a, of this chap ter.  In such cases, the \nlender must request that VA specifically  recognize it as supervised and must \nbe a wholly owned subsidiary or af filiate of a VA recognized supervised \nlender.     The relationship between a wholly-owned  subsidiary or affiliate of a VA-\nrecognized supervised lender and that supervised lender is to be the basis for \nrecognition as supervised, documentation of the structure, capitalization, and \nownership of the subsidiary or affiliat e and its legal/financial relationship to \nthe supervised lender must be submitte d to the VA office with jurisdiction \nover the lender’s home office.  VA will inform the lender of its decision b\ny letter. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 32 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1:  Lender Approval Guidelines  \n \n1-9 \n 3.  Lenders That are Considered Supervised, continued \n  \nd. If a Lender is \nSupervised A supervised lender has the authorit y to close VA-guaranteed loans on an \nautomatic basis (without the prior approva l of VA) except for certain types of \nloans that must be submitted to VA for prior approval by all lenders. \n These loan types are listed in Topic 1 of  this chapter under “Prior Approval.” \n The supervised lender must obtain VA rec ognition of agents it uses to make \nVA loans. See Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. \n \nIf the lender uses an agent, it must s ubmit the following to the VA office with \njurisdiction over its home office by January 31 of each year:  \n a list of the VA-recognized agency re lationships it wishes to renew, \n the annual renewal fee (see Topic 10 of  this chapter) for each lender agent \nthat acts for the lender and had been  recognized by VA as the lender’s agent \nas of September 30 (120 days before payment is due), and \n any other informati on requested by VA. \n Although VA offices may issue an annual reminder notice to lenders that the \nabove information is due, lenders bear  the ultimate res ponsibility for timely \nsubmission of the information and appropr iate fees.  Failure to pay annual \nrenewal fees could result in loss of a lender’s automatic processin\ng authorit y. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 33 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1: Lender Approval Guidelines \n1-10 4.

If the lender has automatic authority, its  agent can close loans automatically \non its behalf.  This can be done to th e extent the loans could be closed \nautomatically if made by the le nder, provided VA requirements for \nrecognition of an agency re lationship and reporting it on VA Form 26-1820, \nReport and Certification of Loan Disbursement,  have been complied with. \n If the lender is a non-supervised automati c lender, this mean s all loans must \nbe reviewed and approved by a VA-a pproved underwriter employed by the \nlender.

The Issue Changes in ownership or corporate structure of a lender may impact its \ncontinued qualifications for automati c authority.  Lenders must notify VA \nwhenever a merger, acquisition, or cha nge in the ownership of the lender \noccurs, so that VA can evaluate any imp act on the lender’s pa rticipation in the \nVA Home Loan program.   Although only the terms “merger” and “acquisition” and “selling,” \n“acquiring” or “surviving” entities are us ed in this paragraph, the concepts \nand procedures in this paragraph apply to  every type of rest ructuring that has \na significant impact on an organization’s ownership, structure,  or assets, and \nso on. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 49 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1: Lender Approval Guidelines \n1-26 8.

Calculation of Adjusted Net Worth \n  \nChange Date February 1, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n  \na. Method Net worth for VA purposes is determined b y 38 C.F.R. §36.4352(b)(4)(ii).  \n   \nb. CPA \nRequirement Adjusted net worth must be calcu lated by a CPA using an audited  and \ncertified balance sheet from the lender’s  latest financial statement, per the \nabove re gulation. \n  \nc. Calculation Adjusted net worth is total assets, minus total liabilities, minus  the following \nunacceptable assets: \n Any assets of the lender pledged to s ecure obligations of another person or \nentity. \n Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related \nentities, in which the lender’s office rs or stockholders have a personal \ninterest, unrelated to thei r position as an officer or stockholder.  Personal \ninterest indicates a relationship between the lender and a pe rson or entity in \nwhich that specified person has a financ ial interest in or is employed in a \nmanagement position by the lender. \n Any investment in related entities in which the lender’s officers or \nstockholders (or their family members) ha ve a personal intere st unrelated to \ntheir position as an of ficer or stockholder. \n That portion of an investment in jo int ventures, subsid iaries, affiliates \nand/or other related entities, which is carried at a value greater than equity, \nas adjusted (“equity, as adjusted” mean s the book value of the related entity \nreduced by the amount of unacceptable asse ts carried by the related entity). \n All intangibles, such as goodwill, covena nts not to compete, franchisee fees, \norganization costs, and so on, except una mortized servicing costs carried at \na value established by an arm’s-leng th transaction and presented in \naccordance with generally-accepted accounting principles. \n That portion of an asset not readily  marketable and for which appraised \nvalues are very subjective carried at a value in excess of a substantially \ndiscounted appraised value.  Assets such as antiques, art work, and gemstones are subject to th is provision and should be carried at the lower of \ncost or market. \n Any asset that is principally used for th e personal enjoyment of an officer or \nstockholder and not for normal business purposes. \n \n\n--- PAGE 64 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1:  Lender Approval Guidelines  \n \n1-41 \n 14.

Purpose A quality control (QC) plan must be submitted with every non-supervised \nlender’s application for automatic authorit y.  This exhibit outlines the criteria \nwhich the QC plan must satisfy.  Although supervised lenders are not \nrequired to submit a QC plan with th eir application, VA will review the QC \nplan when VA perform s a lender audit. \n  \nb. Audit \nProgram The QC plan must provide for: \n \n a program of internal or external audit of the lender’s compliance with VA \nloan processing and underwr iting requirements, or \n independent review by management personnel knowledgeable of such \nrequirements who have no direct loan processing or underwriting \nresponsibilities. \n  \nc. Adequate \nScope The QC plan must provide: \n \n Audits or reviews are not less than ten percen t of all VA-guaranteed \nmortgages originated by the lender monthly, including its branches and \nauthorized agents except that lende rs making more than 140 VA mortgages \nmonthly may use statistical  sampling methods in lie u of the ten percent. \n Loans processed by all loan offi cers and underwriters and a random \nselection which includes loans from all branch offices and authorized \nagents.   \n Procedures for expanding scope when  fraudulent activity or patterns of \ndeficiencies are identified.  \n For lenders participating in LAPP, that  reviews include the QC procedures. \n Procedures for validating third pa rty verification data obtained through \nAutomated Underwriting Systems (AUS). \n For each branch office that originates VA loans, an on-site branch office \nreview should be conduc ted at least once annuall y. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 65 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1: Lender Approval Guidelines \n1-42 14.

Deficiencies \nReported to VA The QC plan must: \n \n Require prompt reporting of any vi olation of law or regulation, false \nstatements or program abuses by the lender, its employees or any other \nparty to the transaction to th e VA office of jurisdiction, and \n Provide for furnishin g audit or review findin gs to VA on demand.   \n  \ng. Current VA \nUnderwriting \nPolicies and Procedures Maintained The QC plan must ensure that: \n \n The lender’s procedures ar e revised in a timely ma nner to accurately reflect \nchanges in VA requirements.   \n Each of the lender’s offices, including  its approved agent(s) and branches, \nmaintains copies of a ll VA publications, includ ing regulations, handbooks, \nand releases, which are relevant to  the lender’s VA loan origination \nactivities.  They must be accessible to  all employees, periodically reviewed \nwith appropriate sta ff, and kept current. \n \nh. Only \nAuthorized \nPersons Process Loans The QC plan must ensure that all loans submitted by the lender to VA for \nguaranty are processed by em ployees of the lender or its authorized agent(s). \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 66 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 1:  Lender Approval Guidelines  \n \n1-43 \n 14.

Funding Fees \nPaid The QC plan must ensure that VA fu nding fees are remitte d within 15 days \nfrom the date of loan closing and late  charges and interest penalties are \npromptl y submitted. \n  \nj. Escrow Fund \nManagement The QC plan must ensure that escr ow funds received from borrowers are not \nexcessive and are not used for any purposes other than that for which they are \nreceived. \n  \nk. Debarred \nPersons Not Employed The QC plan must ensure that th e lender does not employ for VA loan \norigination, or underwriting, any individua l who is debarred or suspended. \n \nl.

How to Establish the Applicant’s Eligibility for a VA Loan \n \nChange Date March 28, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \n \na. What is Eligibility Eligibility means the Veteran meets the basic criteria of length of service \n(LOS) and character of service (COS) fo r the home loan benefit. Entitlement \nis the amount a Veteran has available for a guaranty on a loan.  An eligible \nVeteran must still meet credit and inco me standards in order to qualify for a \nVA-\nguaranteed loan. \n \nb. The \nLender’s Role The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) issued in WebLGY is the proof of \neligibility for the lender.  The lender must ensure the applicant is an  eligible Veteran before an appraisal \nis ordered, the loan cannot be proc essed or closed.  Lenders should never  \nclose a loan before they establish el igibility. VA cannot guarantee a loan for \nan ineligible Veteran.    Once a COE is issued there may be cond itions on the COE which must be met \nin order to receive a guaranty.  The c onditions that could appear on the COE \nare:  \n Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) - Valid unless discharged or \nreleased subsequent to date of th is certificate.  A certification of \ncontinuous active duty as of date of  note is required. This COE is not \nvalid if the ADSM was discharged afte r the date of the certificate. In \nthis instance, a new COE must be obtained.   \n Funding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937  to the Regional \nLoan Center (RLC) of Jurisdiction.  Please have the lender contact the \nRLC for loan processing. \n Funding Fee – Veteran is not exem pt from funding fee due to non-\nservice connected pension.  Loan  application will require prior \napproval processing by VA.  \n Reserve or National Guard Member  – Valid unless discharged or \nreleased subsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of \ncontinuous service in the Selected Re serve or National Guard as of the \ndate of the note is required.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 73 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-3 \n 1. How to Establish the Applicant’s Eligibility for a VA Loan, \ncontinued  \n \nb. The \nLender’s Role, continued   Reserve/National Guard Funding Fee – Entitlement is based on service \nin the Selected Reserve and/or Nati onal Guard so an increased funding \nfee is required. \n Refinance Restoration – Restored entitlement previ ously used or \ncharged for a VA Loan Indetification Number (LIN) as shown here is \navailable only for use in connecti on with the property which secured \nthat loan. \n One-Time Restoration – Entitlement previously used for a VA LIN has \nbeen restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38 \nU.S.C. 3702 (b)(4) .  Any future restoration requires disposal of all \nproperty obtained with a VA loan.  \n Subsequent Use Funding Fee – Enti tlement code of “5” indicates \npreviously used entitlement has been  restored.  The Veteran must pay a \nsubsequent use funding fee on any fu ture loan unless the Veteran is \nexempt. \n Surviving Spouse – Eligibility of th e surviving spouse and the validity \nof guaranty entitlement hereby evidenced will be null and void if any \nchange in marital status occurs, subs equent to the date of this COE and \nprior to the date a loan to the wi dow or widower is closed, unless the \nlender making the loan was not aware of any change in marital status \nand obtained on the date the loan clos ed an affidavit from the surviving \nspouse in the form pres cribed by the Secretary.  \n Prisoner of War/Missing in Acti on (POW/MIA) – This certificate \nevidences eligibility under 38 U.S.C 3701 (b)(3)  of the individual \nnamed as the spouse of a Servicemem ber missing in action or prisoner \nof war.  Any unused entitlement wi ll terminate automatically upon the \nreceipt of official no tice that the Servicemem ber is no longer in a \ncategory specified in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(3)  or upon dissolution of \nmarriage.  \n Paid-in-Full Loan – Entitlement char ged on a paid-in-full loan cannot \nbe restored until the Veteran applies fo r restoration of entitlement.  The \nlender shall submit the applica tion electronically through VA’s \nAutomated Certificate of Eligib ility (ACE) online application. \n Foreclosed Loan – Entitlement char ged on a foreclosed loan cannot be \nrestored until VA’s loss on the loan ha s been fully repa id.  Information \nabout repayment of the loss may be  obtained by cont acting an RLC. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 74 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-4 \n 1.

The \nLenders Role, continued   \nAlthough this chapter discusses some of the basic eligibility  criteria, it is not \nintended to provide a lender with all the knowledge necessary to make an \neligibility determination; consequentl y, all the various exceptions and nuances \nof eligibility are not included.  Appe ndix 1-A at the end of this chapter \nprovides a quick reference and overvie w of basic eligibility criteria. \n Lenders must use VA’s ACE online app lication to obtain the COE. Go to \nVA’s Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications toolbar; then select Eligibility  and follow the prompts.   In many cases, a COE \ncan be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders  should select the link to submit an \nelectronic application.  Th is method allows lenders to upload supporting \ndocumentation and submit an application el ectronically to be processed by one \nof the RLCs.  A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at \nhttp://www.ebenefits.va.gov  or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26- \n1880 , Request for a Certificate of Eligibility  and mailing it to the listed RLC.  \nSimultaneous applications may delay COE processing.  To ensure quicker \nresponses, it is preferable to apply online. \n \n \nc. IRRRL \nEligibility Determination  \nVA systems will not generate a VA case number for an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL) if th ere is no record of an active VA \nloan.  This means if a lender successfu lly obtains a case nu mber for an IRRRL, \na COE is not required.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 75 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-5 \n 2. What the Certificate of  Eligibility Tells the Lender \n \nChange Date March 28, 2019 \n This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. \n \n \na. Eligibility     b. Amount of Entitlement   \nThe lender may rely on a COE as proof th e Veteran is eligible for the home \nloan benefit.  Although elig ible for the home lo an benefit, Vete rans must still \nqualify based on income and credit be fore loan approval is granted. \n \n \nEntitlement is the amount available for use on a loan. The amount of basic \nentitlement is $36,000.  This may be reduced  if a Veteran has used entitlement \nbefore which has not been restored.  The amount of basic entitlement will be \ndisplayed near the center of the CO E. For example it may say:    \n                                                        \n“THIS VETERAN’S BASIC ENTITLEMENT IS $_________ .  TOTAL ENTITLEMENT CHARGE D TO PREVIOUS VA \nLOANS IS $_______ .” \n \nFor loans greater than $144,000, bonus enti tlement may be available.  For \nloans greater than $144,000, but less than $484,350, the entitlement is 25 \npercent.  For loans greater than $484,350, the maximum en titlement is 25 \npercent of the loan limit, which can va ry by county. For a lis t of loan limits by \ncounty, visit  http://www.benefits.va.gov/ homeloans/lenders.a sp.  Please note \ncounty limits can change yearly.  VA w ill post the limits for each year on our \nwebsite as they change. \n \nThe Veteran may have entitlement for loans greater than $144,000, the COE does not reflect the bonus en titlement.  Instead, an asterisk \nby the word “available” refers to a no te, which explains the possibility of \nadditional entitlement. \n \nIf the Veteran previously used entitlement, which has not been restored, \navailable entitlement is re duced by the amount used on the prior loan(s).  The \nlender has three options in this situation: \n \n Make the loan knowing that VA’s guar anty is limited to the amount of \navailable entitlement, or \n Have the Veteran apply for restoratio n of previously used entitlement, \nor \n The Veteran may provide a downpaym ent in conjunction with their \nremaining entitlement.                                                                          \n \n               Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 76 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-6 \n 2.

Additionally, on COEs with \nan “exempt” status, lenders may treat any service-conne cted disability income \namount appearing in the “condition” secti on of the COE as verified income.  \nThere is no need to fax in VA Form 26- 8937 to confirm the status or amount \nshowin\ng on the COE. \n \n \nf. Additional Conditions Listed on Some COE Forms   \nAdditional conditions that th e lender and Veteran must comply with are listed \non the COE, under the conditions headi ng.  The following table provides the \nactions a lender should take fo r each condition, if applicable: \n \nConditions   What to Do  \nValid unless discharged or released \nsubsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of c ontinuous active duty \nas of the date of note is required.  Ensure the Veteran is still on \nactive duty before closing the loan. If the Veteran is discharged or  released prior to loan closing, request a  new COE and do not close the loan until  received. \nExcluded entitlement previously used for \na VA LIN as shown herein is available only for use in c onnection with the \nproperty that secured that loan. If the entitlement used for the \nprior loan identified in this condition is needed for the proposed loan, ensure the proposed loan will be secured by the same property as the prior loan.

The \n“Subsequent Use Funding Fee” Condition Conditions   What to Do  \nEntitlement previously used for \na VA LIN has been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38 U.S.C. \n3702(b)(4) .  Any future \nrestoration requires disposal of all property or properties obtained with a VA loan.  The Veteran must have proof that all \nproperties with VA-guaranteed loans have been disposed. \nThe Veteran is not exempt from the funding fee due to receipt of non-service connected pension.  Loan application will require prior approval processing by VA.  Non service-connected pension must \nbe submitted to VA for prior approval.  Concurrence is required from Pension Service, so allow extra time for processing.  \nFunding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937  to the \nRLC of jurisdiction.  Please \nhave the lender contact the RLC \nfor loan processing. The Veteran has a fiduciary and the \nloan must be submitted to VA for prior approval. Concurrence is \nrequired from Fiduciary Service, so \nallow extra time for processing.  \n  \n The “Subsequent Use Funding Fee” indi cates the Veteran has used their \nhome loan benefit before, so a higher funding fee is required. \n  \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 80 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-10 \n 3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility \n \nChange Date March 28, 2019  \nThis chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \n \na. Procedures Lenders must first atte mpt to obtain a COE through the ACE application, \nwhich can be accessed through the VIP.    If a COE cannot be obtained immediately, lenders should sele ct the electronic \napplication link that permits them to submit an electronic application.  If the \nCOE is issued with reduced entitlemen t and restoration is needed, use the \n“Correct COE” function to request an updated COE.   \n The WebLGY system allows lenders to upload documentation, such as discharge papers or evidence to supp ort restoration (Closing Disclosure, \nHUD-1 etc.), along with the el ectronic application. Lenders should not  \nupload scanned documents without first completing an elec tronic application. \nUsing this feature, rather than mail,  is the preferred method, as it greatly \nreduces processing time.  \n Inability to obtain a COE in WebL GY does not mean the Veteran is \nineligible, only that the system does  not have sufficient information to \nmake an automatic determination.  Le nders should always continue the \napplication process as described in the preceding paragraph. \n Application for an Un married Surviving Spous es. A surviving spouse \nof a Veteran, who dies on activ e duty or from service-connected \ncauses, may still be eligible for a COE.  If the surviving spouse is \nremarried on or after age 57, and on or after December 16, 2003, they still may be eligible.  Eligibility ma y also be granted to the spouse of \nan active duty member who is listed  as MIA or POW for at least 90 \ndays.  Eligibility under this MIA/PO W provision is limited to one-time \nuse only.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 81 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-11 \n 3.

Procedures, \ncontinued  a) Surviving spouses of Veterans who died from non-service connected \ncauses may also be eligible if a ny of the following conditions are \nmet:  (1) the Veteran was rated tota lly disabled for 10 years or more \nimmediately preceding death; or (2 ) was rated totally disabled for \nnot less than 5 years from date of  discharge or release from active \nduty to date of death, or (3) th e Veteran was a former POW who \ndied after September 30, 1999, and was rated totally disabled for not \nless than 1 year immediately preceding death. The above eligibility requirements are determined by VA Compensation Department.  Once completed, they will determine if the surviving spouse is eligible for qualifying Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC).  \nb) If applying for the first time, su rviving spouses must complete VA \nForm 26-1817 , Request for Determination of Loan Guaranty \nEligibility-Unmarried  Surviving Spouses , instead of VA Form 26-\n1880 . \nc) Both the VA Form 26-1817  and WebLGY should be completed by \nusing the name of the surviving spou se, date of birth, social security \nnumber, and then upload the VA Form 26-1817  in WebLGY. \n \n \n  \n\n--- PAGE 82 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-12 \n 4. Proof of Service Requirements \n \nChange Date March 28, 2019  \n This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na. Discharged \nVeterans (Regular Military) The DD214 Form , Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty,  will \ngenerally contain all the information needed for VA to make an eligibility \ndetermination for person s who served on active duty of the a regular \ncomponent of the Armed Forces.  The regular Armed Forces include active \nduty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.  \n \n VA will accept legible copies of the DD214 Form . \n Veterans separated after Oct ober 1, 1979, should furnish Member \nCopy 2, 4, 8, or any copy of a DD214 Form  that includes the COS and \nthe narrative reason for separation.  Veterans separated from military \nservice after January 1, 1950, should have received  DD214 Form . Veterans separated from active duty before January 1, \n1950, received documentation other than DD214 Form .  To be \nacceptable, it should indicate: \n \na) LOS, and \nb) COS \n \n \nb. Veterans \nStill on Active Duty Proof of service for Veterans on active  duty is a Statement of Service (SOS) \nsigned by, or by the direction of, the ad jutant, personnel office, or commander \nof the unit or higher headquarters they ar e attached to. Ther e is no one unique \nform used by the military for an SOS.  While an SOS is typically on military \nletterhead, it may also be electronic and both are acceptable.  The SOS must \nclearly show the: \n \n Veteran’s full name, \n social Security Number (SSN) or  the last 4 digits of the SSN, \n entry date on active duty, \n duration of lost time, if any, and \n name and point of contac t for the command or unit. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 83 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-13 \n 4. Proof of Service Requirements, continued \n \nc. Discharged Reserve/ Guard Members  \nThere is no one form used by the Reserves  or National Guard that is similar to \nDD214 Form .  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit with the Ready \nReserve designated by their respective services and approved by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff as so essential to in itial wartime missions that they have \npriority over all other reserves.  The National Guard is a unique element of the U.S. Military that serves both \ncommunity and country.  Any state gover nor or the President of the United \nStates can call on the Guard in a moments notice.  Discharged members of the Army or Air National Guard may submit NGB \nForm 22 , Report of Separation and Record of Service , and NGB Form 23B , \nRetirement Points Summary Statement , with the COS document.  Members of \nthe Reserves should submit their points statement with COS.  Typically, all members of the Reserv es and/or Guard receive an annual \nretirement points summary which indicates the level and length of participation.  The applicant should submit the latest retirement point \nstatement received, along with evidence of honorable service. \n VA will accept le\ngible copies. \n \nd. Current Reserve/ Guard Members Individuals who are still members of  the Reserves/National Guard must \nprovide an SOS signed by, or by the di rection of, the adjutant, personnel \noffice, or commander of the unit or highe r headquarters they  are attached to. \nThere is no one form used uniformly by the military for an SOS.  While an \nSOS is typically on military letterhead, some may be electronic and both are \nacceptable.    The statement of service must clearly show the:  \n Veteran’s full name, \n the SSN or the last 4 digits of the SSN, \n entry date of the applican t’s Reserve/Guard duty, and \n the unit must state the creditable (act ually drilled) years served in the \nReserves or the National Guard. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 84 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-14 \n 4.

Current \nReserve/ Guard Members, Continued   \nIf called to active duty, a copy of the or ders must accompany the SOS with the \nname and point of contac t for the command or unit. \n The statement must clearly indicate that th e applicant is an “active” reservist or \nNational Guard member and not just in  a control group (i nactive status). \n If Veterans cannot locate proof  of service, they can re quest military documents \neither through the National Archives, http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ , or by \ncompleting SF- 180 , Request Pertaining to Military Records.  The completed \nform should be submitted to the appr opriate address shown. It should not be \nsent to VA.  In many cases, VA internal systems will have sufficient information to make \nthe eligibility determination for those who served on active duty.  Lenders and \nVeterans should not delay requesting a COE pending receipt of requested \nmilitary documents.    \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 85 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-15 \n 5. Basic Eligibility Requirements \n \nChange Date March 28, 2019  \n This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na. General \nRule for Eligibility A Veteran is eligible for VA home loan be nefits if he or she served on active \nduty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Ma rine Corps, or Coast Guard after \nSeptember 15, 1940, and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable after either: \n \n 90 days or more, any part of wh ich occurred during wartime, or \n 181 continuous days or more (peacetime). \n \nb. 2-year \nRequirement A greater length of service is  required for Veterans who: \n \n enlisted (and service began)  after September 7, 1980, or \n entered service as an of ficer after October 16, 1981 \n \nThese Veterans must have completed either: \n \n 24-continuous months of active duty, or \n the full period for which called or ordered to active duty, but not less \nthan 90 days (any part during wa rtime) or 181 continuous days \n(peacetime). \n \nCases involving other than honorable disc harges will usually require further \ndevelopment by the VA Compensation Depa rtment.  This is necessary to \ndetermine if the service was under other than dishonorable conditions. \n \n \n \nc. Wartime \nand Peacetime Refer to the Following Periods of Service  \nWartime Peacetime \nWorld War II  9/16/1940—7/25/1947 Post World War II period  \n7/26/1947—6/26/1950 \nKorean conflict  6/27/1950—1/31/1955 Post Korean period  \n2/1/1955—8/4/1964 \nVietnam era  8/5/64—5/7/1975 (The Vietnam era begins 2/28/1961 for those individuals who served in the Republic of Vietnam.)

Basic Eligibility Requirements, continued  \n \nd. Eligibility \nfor Reserves and/or Guard  \nMembers of the Reserves and National Guard who are not otherwise eligible \nfor loan guaranty benefits are eligib le upon completion of 6 years of service \nin an active or drilling status in the Re serves or Guard (unless released earlier \nspecifically for a service-connected disa bility).  The applicant must have \nreceived an honorable character of disc harge.  A general or under honorable \nconditions discharge is not a qualifying or acceptable character of discharge.  Service in the Individual Ready Reserve or Control Group (inactive status) is \nnot qualif\nying length of service for the home loan pro gram.   \n \n e. Basic Eligibility Table  \nThe table below provides a quick refere nce to some of the most commonly \neligible Veterans.  This table is not exhaustive.  A Veteran’s eligibility for \nhome loan benefits may only be determined by VA.  \n \nf. Eligibility of Spouses of Veterans  \nSome spouses of Veterans may have hom e loan eligibility.  They are the: \n \n unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran, who died as a result of \nservice or service- connected causes, \n surviving spouse of a Veteran w ho dies on active duty or from \nservice-connected causes, who rema rries on or after age 57 and on or \nafter December 16, 2003, and \n spouse of an active duty member who is listed as MIA or a POW for \nat least 90 days. Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited \nto one-time use only. \n surviving spouses of Veterans w ho died from non-service connected \ncauses may also be eligible if cer tain conditions are met.  Those \nconditions are found in Topic 3, subs ection b(1), of this chapter. \n surviving spouse who is eligible for or in receipt of certain types of \nDependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC). \n \n g.

Basic Eligibility Requirements, continued  \n \nh. Other Qualifying Service  \nCongress has periodically granted Ve teran status to groups other than \nmembers of the Army, Air Force, Na vy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, \nsuch as certain members of the Public  Health Service, and cadets at the \nservice academies.  Lenders should cont act one of the RLCs for assistance \nwhen one of these unique cases is encountered.  \n i. Exceptions to LOS  \nThere are numerous exceptions to th e LOS requirements outlined in this \nsection.  For example, 1 day of service is sufficient for an individual who is \ndischarged or released from service (regular active duty or Reserve/National \nGuard) due to a service-connected disa bility which would be listed on the \ndischarge paperwork.  Because of the complexity and number of exceptions, this chapter does not atte mpt to cover all of them.  Because there are \nexceptions, lenders should not assume a Ve teran is not eligible.  Instead, they \nshould create an application and allow VA to make a formal determination of \neligibility.  \n j. When a COE is Denied  \nThe table below provides a quick refe rence to some additional types of \neligible Veterans.  This table is not exhaustive.  A Veteran’s eligibility for \nhome loan benefits may only be determined by VA.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 88 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-18 \n 6. Restoration of Previ ously Used Entitlement \n \na. Basic Restoration  \nEntitlement previously used in c onnection with a VA home loan may be \nrestored under certain circumstances.  Once restored, it can be used again for \nanother VA loan.  Restoration of previ ously used entitlement is possible if: \n \n property which secured the VA-guarant eed loan has been sold, and the \nloan has been paid in full; or \n eligible Veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding \nbalance on a VA loan and substitute  his or her entit lement for the \nsame amount originally used on the loan.  The assuming Veteran, \nsubstituting his/her entitlement, mu st also meet occupancy, income, \nand credit requirements.  This shoul d be completed before requesting \nthe Loan Guaranty Certificate in WebLGY, on the new loan. \n \n b. Special Restoration Cases  \nIn addition to the basic restor ation criteria outlined above, a  \nVeteran may obtain restorat ion of the entitlement used on a prior VA loan \nunder any of the following circumstances:  \n Regular “cash-out” refinance where the prior VA loan has been paid \nin full and the Veteran has made app lication for a refinance loan to be \nsecured by the same property which secured the prior VA loan.  This \nincludes refinancing situations, in which the prior loan will be paid off \nat closing from a VA refinancing loan on the same property, or \n One –time restoration where the prior VA loan has been paid in full, \nbut the Veteran has not disposed of  the property securing the loan.  \nThe Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on the \nprior loan in order to purchase a different property, one time only.  \nOnce such restoration is used, the Veteran’s COE will indicate the one-time restoration.  The COE will also advise that any future restoration (purchase or cash-out refi nance) will require disposal of all \nproperty or properties obtained with a VA loan.  \nExample.  A Veteran used all his en titlement to purchase a home for \n$453,100 in a non-high cost county in Maryla nd.  Prior to job relocation to \nGA, he refinanced the loan to a non-VA loan.  The loan was paid in full; \nhowever, he still owned th e property.  He now want s to purchase a home in \nGA and applies for a one-time restoration.  This is possible.  If the Veteran \nwants to use the benefit in the future  for another purchas e or regular “cash-\nout” refinancing, both properties would have to be disposed of before \nentitlement can be restored.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 89 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement  \n \n2-19 \n 7. Misuse of Veteran’s Entitlement \n \n a. What Constitutes Misuse?  \n \nA basic requirement of the law governi ng the VA home loan program is that \nthe Veteran has a bona fide  intention of occupying his or her property as a \nhome.  Home loan entitlement is not  being used properly if the Veteran \narranges to sell or convey the property to a third party prior to closing the \nloan.  \n \nb. What to Do?  \nContact the VA RLC with jurisdiction over the property for advice regarding \nany case in which there may be a qu estion regarding the legality of \nentitlement use.   \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 90 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-1 Chapter 3.

List of \nEligible Loan Purposes The law authorizes VA to guarantee loans made to eligible veterans only for \nthe following purposes:  \n• To purchase or construct a residence,  including a condominium unit to be \nowned and occupied by the veteran as a home: \n− the loan may include simultaneous purchase of the land on which the \nresidence is situated or will be situated, \n− loans may also be guaranteed for th e construction of a residence on land \nalready owned by the veteran  (a por tion of the loan may be used to \nrefinance a purchase money mortgage or  sales contract for the purchase of \nthe land, subject to reasonab le value requirements), and \n− the residential property may not consist of more than four family units \nand one business unit except in the ca se of certain joint loans.  (See \nsection 1 of chapter 7  for this exception.) \n• To refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan for the purpose of a \nlower interest rate. \n• To refinance an existing mortgage loan  or other indebtedness secured by a \nlien of record on a residence owned a nd occupied by the veteran as a home. \n• To repair, alter, or improve a reside nce owned by the veteran and occupied \nas a home. \n• To simultaneously purchase and improve a home. \n• To improve a residence owned and occ upied by the veteran as the veteran’s \nhome through the installation of a sola r heating system, a solar heating and \ncooling system, or a combined solar heating and cooling system, or through \nthe application of a residential energy  conservation measure.  These energy \nefficiency improvement loans can be ma de in conjunction with any type of \nVA purchase or refinancing loan. \n• To purchase a one-family resident ial unit in a condominium housing \ndevelopment approved by VA. \n• To purchase a farm residence to be owned and occupied by the veteran as a \nhome.  If the loan includes the purchase of farmland, the farmland is \nappraised at its residential va lue only.  (See section 12 of chapter 11 ). \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 95 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-6 2.  Eligible Loan Purposes, Continued \n \nb. Ineligible \nLoan Purposes VA cannot guarantee loans made for inelig ible loan purposes.  Examples of \nineligible loan purposes include:  \n• Purchase of unimproved land with the in tent to improve it at some future \ndate (that is, the land purchase is not in conjunction w ith a construction \nloan). \n• Purchase or construction of a dwelling for investment purposes. \n• Purchase or construction of a combin ed residential and business property, \nunless, \n− the property is primarily for residential purposes, \n− there is not more than one business unit, and \n− the nonresidential area does not exceed 25 percent of the total floor area. \n• Purchase of more than one separa te residential unit or lot unless  the veteran \nwill occupy one unit and there is evidence that: \n− the residential units are unavailable separately, \n− the residential units have a common owner, \n− the residential units have been tr eated as one unit in the past, and \n− the residential units are assessed as one unit, or \n− partition is not practical, as when one  unit serves the other(s) in some \nrespect; for example, common approaches or driveways. \n \nc. Cash to \nVeteran Generally Not an Eligible Loan Purpose Cash to the veteran from loan proceeds is permissible only fo r certain types of \nrefinancing loans and under very limited circumstances, as follows: \n \n• For IRRRLs, see section 1 of chapter 6 . \n• For cash-out refinancing lo ans, see section 3 of chapter 6 . \n \nFor other types of refina ncing loans and all purcha se/acquisition loans, the \nveteran generally cannot receive cash from loan proceeds.  The only exception is the refund of items for whic h the veteran paid cash, which were \nsubsequently included in the loan amount.  Example :  Earnest money can be refunded to the veteran on a no-\ndownpayment loan.  \n  \n \n\n--- PAGE 96 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-7 3.

Does VA \nhave Maximum \nLoan Amounts? Unlike other home loan programs, there are no maximum dollar amounts \nprescribed for VA-guaranteed loans.    Limitations on VA loan size are primarily attributable to two factors:  1. Lenders who sell their VA loans in the secondary market must limit the \nsize of those loans to the maximums prescribed by Government National \nMortgage Association (GNMA) or wh atever conduit they use to sell the \nloans. \n 2. VA limits the amount of the loan to the reasonable value of the property \nshown on the NOV plus the cost of energy efficiency improvements up to $6,000 plus  the VA  funding fee, with the following exceptions.   \n \nException Maximum Loan \nIRRRLs • Existing VA loan balance, plus \n• The cost of any energy efficiency \nimprovements up to $6,000, plus  \n• Allowable fees and charges, plus  \n• Up to two discount points, plus  \n• VA funding fee. \n \n(Lenders must use VA Form 26 -8923 , IRRRL \nWorksheet, for the actual calculation.)  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 97 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-8 3.

The  “rule of thumb” for GNMA is that the \nVA guaranty, or a combination of VA guaranty plus downpayment and/or \nequity, must cover at least 25 percent of the loan. \n \n\n--- PAGE 99 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-10 4.

Maximum \nGuaranty Table Public Law 112-154, the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp \nLejeune Families Act of 2012 , signed August 6, 2012, extended the \ntemporary increase in the maximu m guaranty.  The increase expired \nDecember 31, 2011, but Public Law 112-154, extended it through December \n31, 2014.  The maximum guaranty varies depending on the location of the \nproperty.  While VA does not have a maximum loan amount, there are \neffective “loan limits” for high-cost counties.  The limits are derived by \nconsidering both the median home pri ce for a county and the Freddie Mac \nconforming loan limit.  To aid lenders in determining the maximum guaranty in high-cost counties, VA has created a Loan Limit  chart, with instructions.  \nThis will be updated yearly. \n \n• In general, maximum guaranty, assumi ng the veteran has full entitlement, is \nas shown in the table below. \n    \nLoan Amount Maximum Potential \nGuaranty Special Provisions \nUp to $45,000 50 percent of the loan \namount.

The Law on \nOccupancy The law requires a veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan to certify that he \nor she intends to personally  occupy the property as his or her home.  As of the \ndate of certification, th e veteran must either \n \n• personally live in the property as his or her home, or \n• intend, upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling, to \npersonally move into the property and use it as his or he r home within a \nreasonable time. \n The above requirement applies to all types of VA-guaranteed loans except IRRRLs.  For IRRRLs, the veteran need onl y certify that he or she previously \noccupied the property as his or her home.  \nExample :  A veteran living in a home purchas ed with a VA loan is transferred \nto a duty station overseas.  The vete ran rents out the home.  He/she may \nrefinance the VA loan with an IRRRL based on previous occupancy of the \nhome. \n \nb. What is a \n“Reasonable \nTime?” Occupancy within a “reasonable time\" means within 60 days after the loan \nclosing.  More than 60 days may be considered reasonable if both of the \nfollowing conditions are met: \n \n• the veteran certifies that he or she will personally occupy the property as his \nor her home at a specific da te after loan closing, and \n• there is a particular future event that  will make it possible for the veteran to \npersonally occupy the property as his or her home on a specific future date. \n Occupancy at a date beyond 12 months af ter loan closing generally cannot be \nconsidered reasonable by VA. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 102 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-13 5.  Occupancy, Continued \n  \nc. Occupancy \nby Veteran’s \nSpouse or \nDependent \nChild Occupancy (or intent to occupy) by the spouse or dependent child satisfies the \noccupancy requirement for a vetera n who is on active duty and cannot \npersonally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time.  In the case of a \ndependent child, the veteran’s attorney -in-fact or legal guardian of the \ndependent child must make the certification and sign VA Form 26-1820 , \nReport and Certification of Loan Disbursement. \n Occupancy by the spouse may also satis fy the requirement if the veteran \ncannot personally occupy the dwelling w ithin a reasonable time due to distant \nemployment other than military service. In these specific cases, consult your \nRegional Loan Center  (RLC) to determine if this type of occupancy meets \nVA requirements. \n \nNote :  The cost of maintaining sepa rate living arrangements should be \nconsidered in underwriting the loan.  \nFor an IRRRL, a certification that the s pouse or dependent child (or children) \npreviously occupied the dwelling as  a home will satisfy the requirement. \n \n \nd. Occupancy \nRequirements  \nfor Deployed  Active Duty Servicemembers  Single or married servicemembers, wh ile deployed from their permanent \nduty station, are considered to be in  a temporary duty status and able to \nmeet the occupancy requirement.  This is true without regard to whether or \nnot a spouse will be available to occu py the property prior to the veteran’s \nreturn from deployment.  \n  \ne. Occupancy \nAfter \nRetirement If the veteran states that he or she will retire within 12 months and wants a \nloan to purchase a home in  the retirement location: \n \n• Verify the veteran’s eligibility for retirement on the specified date. \n- Include a copy of the veteran’s applic ation for retirement submitted to his \nor her employer. \n• Carefully consider the applicant’s income after retirement. \n- If retirement income alone is insufficient, obtain firm commitments from an employer that meet the usual stability of income requirements. \n Note :  Only retirement on a specific da te within 12 months qualifies.  \nRetirement “within the next few years”  or “in the near future” is not \nsufficient. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 103 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-14 5.  Occupancy, Continued \n  \nf. Delayed \nOccupancy Due \nto Property \nRepairs or Improvements Home improvements or refinancing loans for extensive changes to the \nproperty which will prevent the vete ran from occupying the property while \nthe work is being completed, constitu te exceptions to the “reasonable time” \nrequirement.    The veteran must certify that he or she intends to occupy or reoccupy the \nproperty as a home upon completion of  the substantial improvements or \nrepairs. \n   \ng. Intermittent \nOccupancy The veteran need not maintain a physical  presence at the property on a daily \nbasis.  However, occupancy “as the ve teran’s home” implies that the home is \nlocated within reasonable proximity of the veteran’s place of employment.  If \nthe veteran’s employment requires the veteran’s absence from home a \nsubstantial amount of time, the following two conditions must be met:  \n• the veteran must have a history of continuous residence in the community, \nand \n• there must be no indication that the veteran has established, intends to \nestablish, or may be required to estab lish, a principal residence elsewhere. \n \nUse of the property as a seasonal va cation home does not satisfy the \noccupancy requirement . \n \nh. Unusual \nCircumstances Discuss unusual circumstances of occupancy with the appropriate VA office  \nor submit a description of the circumstances to the VA office  for prior \napproval. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 104 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-15 5.  Occupancy, Continued \n  \ni. The \nCertification The veteran certifies that the occupa ncy requirement is met by checking the \nappropriate occupancy block and signing: \n \n• VA Form 26-1802a , HUD/VA Addendum to the Uniform Residential Loan \nApplication, at the time of  loan application (prior  approval loans only), and \n• VA Form 26-1820 , Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement, at the \ntime of loan closing (all loans).   \n This satisfies the lender’s obligati on to obtain the veteran’s occupancy \ncertification.  The lender may accept the occupancy certi fication at face value unless there \nis specific information indicating the veteran will not occupy the property as a \nhome or does not intend to occupy within a reasonable time after loan closing. \n Where doubt exists, the test is whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that the veteran can and will occupy the prope rty as certified.  \nContact the appropriate VA office  if the lender cannot resolve issues \ninvolving the veteran’s inte nt by applying this test. \n \n\n--- PAGE 105 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-16 6.

Requirement VA no longer prescribes inte rest rates for VA-guaranteed loans.  The interest \nrate is negotiated between the vetera n-borrower and the lender to allow the \nveteran to obtain the best available rate. \n \nb. Changes to \nthe Agreed Upon Interest \nRate The lender and borrower are expected  to honor any lock-in or other \nagreements they have entered into which impact the interest rate on the loan.  \nVA does not object to changes in the agreed upon rate, as long as no \nlender/borrower agreements are violate d.  The following procedure applies in \nsuch cases.   Any increase in the interest rate of more than one percent requires:  \n• re-underwriting to ascertain the veteran’ s continued ability to qualify for the \nloan, \n• documentation of the change, and  \n• a new or corrected Uniform Resident ial Loan Application, (URLA) with \nany corrections initialed and dated by the borrower. \n Reference :  For prior approval lo ans, see section 4 of chapter 5 . \n \n\n--- PAGE 106 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-17 7. Discount Points \n  \nChange Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 \n• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   \n  \na. Requirement Veterans may pay reasonable discount points on VA-guaranteed loans.  The \namount of discount points is whatever  the borrower and lender agree upon.  \nDiscount points can be based on the prin cipal amount of the loan after adding \nthe VA funding fee, if the funding fee will be paid from loan proceeds. \n \nb. When Can \nPoints be Included in the \nLoan? Discount points may be rolled into the loan only in the case of refinancing  \nloans, subject to the following limitations:  \nInterest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans  \nA maximum of two discount points can be rolled into the loan. \n If the borrower pays more than two poi nts, the remainder must be paid in \ncash . \n \nRefinancing of Construction Loans, etc. \nLoans to refinance are: \n \n• a construction loan, \n• an installment land sales contract, or \n• a loan assumed by the veteran at an in terest rate higher than that for the \nproposed refinancing loan   \n Any reasonable amount of discount points ma y be rolled into the loan as long \nas the sum of the outstanding balance of the loan plus allowable closing costs \nand discount points does not exceed  the VA reasonable value.  \n \nReference :  See the maximum loan limitations  in section 3 of  this chapter. \n \nCash-out Refinancing Loans \nWhile discount points cannot specifically  be included in the loan amount, the \nborrower can receive cash from loan proceeds, subject to maximum loan \nlimits (See section 3 of this chapter) .  The cash received by the borrower can \nbe used for any purpose acceptable to the lender, including payment of reasonable discount points. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 107 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-18 7.

Maximum \nMaturity • Amortized loans:  30 years and 32 days,  \n• Nonamortized loans: 5 years. \n In addition, every loan must be repaya ble within the estim ated economic life \nof the property securing the loan.  The period for repayment of a loan is measured from the date of the note or \nother evidence of  indebtedness. \n \nb. Maturity \nExtending \nBeyond the \nMaximum VA regulations provide that any amounts, which fall due beyond the \nmaximum maturity automatically, fall due  on the maximum maturity date.   \n Thus, if a lender inadvertently makes a loan that exceeds the maximum maturity, it may still be subject to guaranty.    However, the regulations also limit the amount that can be collected as a final \ninstallment, such as, they prohibit ex cessive ballooning.  The holder of a loan \nthat violates this provis ion may desire to correct the situation through means \nwhich are legally proper in the jurisdiction. \n \n\n--- PAGE 109 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-20 9.

Requirement All VA loans must be amortized if the maturity date is beyond 5 years from \nthe date of the loan.  Loans with term s less than 5 years are considered term \nloans and need not be amortized.  Generally, for amortized VA loans:  \n• payments must be approximately equal, \n• principal must be reduced at least once annually, and \n• the final installment must not exceed two times the average of the preceding \ninstallments. \n Exceptions to these requirements are made in the case of:  \n• GPMs – See section 7 of chapter 7 , \n• Growing Equity Mortgages (G EMs) – See section 8 of chapter 7 , \n• alternative amortization plan s prior approved by VA, and \n• construction loans. \n \nb. Alternative \nAmortization \nPlans  Certain amortization plans which do not meet the requirements described in \nsubsection a above may be used if ap proved in advance by VA.  A lender may \nsubmit an amortization plan to VA for prior approval if the plan: \n \n• is generally recognized; that is, is us ed extensively by established lending \ninstitutions, but \n• does not meet the requirements of appr oximately equal periodic payments \nand a reduction in principal not less often than annually. \n \nException :  GPMs and GEMs. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 110 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-21 9.

Protection \nAgainst Loss VA guarantees a portion of the loan, identified on the VA Loan Guaranty \nCertificate (LGC) by percentage and dollar amounts.  If a loss ultimately occurs on the loan, VA will reimburse the loan holder for all or part of such loss:  \n• limited by the stated percentage and dollar amount of the guaranty, \n• limited by any VA maximums for reas onable and customary foreclosure \nexpenses, and \n• subject to the lender’s compliance wi th applicable law and regulations. \n \nb. Lender \nResponsibility It is the lender’s responsib ility to comply with all laws and regulations related \nto the VA Home Loan program, and ther eby prevent VA’s denial or reduction \nof a payment on a future claim.  A lende r can accomplish this by ensuring that \nits employees who perform work related to VA lending:  \n• understand and comply with VA policies,  procedures and regulations, and \napplicable law, and \n• direct questions to VA when issues ar ise that are not addressed in this \nhandbook or other materials provided by VA. \n \nc. When is a \nLoan that was \nClosed \nAutomatically Guaranteed? A loan is automatically guaranteed by  VA upon closing (prior to issuance of \nthe LGC) provided the loan was made by:  \n• a supervised or a nonsupervised lend er with automatic authority, and \n• the lender complied with app licable law and regulations.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 113 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-24 11.  What Does a VA Guaranty Mean to the Lender?, Continued \n  \nd. When is a \nPrior Approval \nLoan \nGuaranteed?  A prior approval loan is also gua ranteed by VA upon closing (prior to \nissuance of the LGC) provided:  \n• the closed loan matches the proposed  loan upon which the Certificate of \nCommitment was based, and \n• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations. \n  \ne. What is \nEvidence of \nGuaranty? Evidence of guaranty is VA Form 26-1899, Loan Guaranty Certificate, which \nis generated electronically via VA’s webLGY application.  The LGC \nrepresents tangible proof to the lende r that VA’s guaranty is given in good \nfaith.  It is contingent upon:  \n• the veteran, property and purpose of the loan being eligible, \n• no fraud or material misrepresentat ion on the part of the lender, and \n• the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. \n For example, VA may deny or reduce paym ent on a future claim based on the \nlender or holder’s noncompliance whether or not VA has issued evidence of \nguaranty on the loan.  The LGC also has an audit indicator th at, if noted Yes, lets the lender know \nthe case has been identified for full review .  In these instances, the lender then \nneeds to submit a complete loan origination package to the appropriate VA office for review.  Packages should be submitted within 15 days of the LGC being generated. \n \nf. Total Loss of \nGuaranty Willful fraud or material misrepresentation by the lender or holder, or by an \nagent of either, will relieve VA of lia bility for payment of any claim on the \nloan.  VA also has no liability in the case of: \n \n• forgery on the note, mortgage, loan app lication, or other loan documents, or \n• a Certificate of Eligibility or disc harge papers that are counterfeited, \nfalsified, or not issued by the Government. \n A holder of a VA loan who acquired the loan without  notice or knowledge of \nfraud or material misrepresentation in procuring the guaranty will not be \ndenied payment of any claim on the loan  by reason of such fraud or material \nmisrepresentation. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 114 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-25 11.  What Does a VA Guaranty Mean to the Lender?, Continued \n  \ng. Partial Loss \nof Guaranty A holder of a VA loan who fails to comply with applicable laws and \nregulations may receive only partial pa yment of a claim if  VA’s liability \nincreases due to the holder’s noncomp liance.  Material misrepresentation \nwhich is not willful has the same consequence.   No claim will be paid on such loan until the amount of any increase in VA’s liability is known.  The bur den of proof is on the holde r to establish that VA’s \nincreased liability is not due to  the holder’s noncompliance or \nmisrepresentation.  Examples  of noncompliance with applicable  law and regulations which may \nlead to an increase in VA’s liability include: \n \n• failure to obtain and retain the requi red lien on property to secure the loan, \n• failure to include the powe r to substitute trustees, \n• failure to procure and main tain insurance coverage, \n• failure to advise VA as to default, \n• failure to provide notice of inte ntion to begin foreclosure action, \n• failure to provide notice to VA in a ny suit or action, or notice of sale, \n• improper release, conveyance, substi tution or exchange of security, \n• lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction, \n• failure to assure that escrowed/earma rked funds are expended in accordance \nwith the agreement, and \n• failure to take into consideration li mitations upon the quantum or quality of \nthe estate or property. \n \n\n--- PAGE 115 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 3:  The VA Loan and Guaranty \n \n3-26 12.

Corrections \nto LGCs LGCs are generated using data entere d from several sources, including the \nVA Funding Fee Payment System  (VA FFPS).  If a lender discovers an error \nin reported data, such as  date of loan closing, before  they have generated the \nLGC, they must access the VA FFPS system to make the correction.  This will then result in the correct closi ng date being shown when the LGC is \nobtained.    If the error is discovered after  the LGC has been generated, lenders will need \nto contact the appropriate VA RLC  for assistance.

Maintenance \nof Loan \nRecords Lenders must maintain copies of all loan origination records on  \nVA-guaranteed home loans for at least 2 years from the date of loan closing.  Even if the loan is sold, the original lender must maintain these records (or legible copies) for th e required period.  \n Loan origination records include:  \n• the loan application (including any preliminary application), \n• verifications of empl oyment and deposit, \n• all credit reports (including preliminary credit reports), \n• copies of each sales contract and addendum, \n• letters of explanation for adverse cred it items, discrepancies and the like, \n• direct references from creditors, \n• correspondence with employers, \n• appraisal and compliance inspection reports, \n• reports on termite and other in spections of the property, \n• builder change orders, and \n• all closing papers and documents. \n Lenders must make these records accessible to VA personnel conducting \naudit reviews. \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 117 ---\nChapter 4  Credit Underwriting  \n \nOverview  \n \nIn this Chapter  This c hapter contains the following topics.  \n \nTopic  Topic Name  See Page  \n1 General Underwriting Information  4-2 \n2 Income – Required Documentation and Analysis  4-7 \n3 Income Taxes and Other Deductions  4-32 \n4 Assets and Closing Requirements  4-35 \n5 Debts and Obligations  4-38 \n6  Debts Owed to the Federal Government  4-44 \n7 Credit History – Required Documentation and \nAnalysis  4-49 \n8 Automated Underwriting  Cases (AUS)   4-56 \n9 How to Complete VA Form 26 -6393, Loan Analysis  4-64 \n10 How to Analyze the Information on VA Form 26 -\n6393, Loan Analysis  4-70 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 118 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-2 \n 1. General Underwriting Information    \n \nChange Date   \nFebruary 22, 2019   \n• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \na. \nUnderwriting \nInformation  VA Underwriting Standards require lenders to always utilize the following \nguidance when underwriting VA -guaranteed loans:  \n  \nLenders are encouraged to make VA loans to all qualified Veterans who apply.  \nVA’s underwriting standards are intended to provide guidelines for \nunderwriters.  Decisions must be based on sound application of the standards, \nand underwriters are expected to use good judgment and flexibility in applyi ng \nunderwriting guidelines.  Not all possible circumstances are addressed \ntherefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexibility in \nadministering this important Veterans’ benefit.  \n \nb. Basic \nRequirements  By law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that \nthe Veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated \nincome that bears a proper relation to the anticipated terms of repayment.  \nVA’s underwriting stan dards are incorporated into VA regulations at  \n38 C .F.R. 36.4340  and explained in this chapter.  This chapter addresses th e \nprocedures for verifications and analysis involved in underwriting a  \nVA-guaranteed loan.  In the event the lender fails to perform their \nresponsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of \nauthority to underwrite and close VA loans . \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 119 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-3 \n 1.

Lender’s \nResponsibilities  Lenders are responsible for:  \n \n• developing all credit information,  \n• properly obtaining all required verifications and the credit report,  \n• ensuring the accuracy of all information on which the loan decision is \nbased,  \n• complying with the law and regulations governing VA’s underwriting \nstandards, and with VA’s underwriting policies, procedures, and \nguidelines, and  \n• certifyi ng as to compliance with all of the above.  \n                                                                                  Continued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 120 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-4 \n 1.

Lender’s \nProcedures  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature  as \ndefined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act , \ncommonly referred to as the E -sign Act.  \n \nThe procedures below address only the credit underwriting of the loan.   \nChapter 5 of this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed \nwhen making a VA loan.   \n \nStep  Action  \n1  \nInitiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System \n(CAIVR S) inquiries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this  \nchapter . \n2  \nObtain all necessary verifications.   \n \nThe borrower’s authorization can be obtained separately for the \nlender’s required verifications, or on one blanket authorization form.  \n  \nThe Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY \nprovides verification of the amount of the Veteran’s availab le \nentitlement, verification of exempt/non -exempt from the VA Funding \nFee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability \ncompensation.  Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal.  \n \nThe tri -merged credit report and verifications can be order ed by the \nlender or its agent or a party designated by the lender to perform that \nfunction.  However, these documents must always be delivered by the \ncredit reporting agency or verifying party directly to the lender or its \nagent, and never to another party .  VA only permits the Veteran to \npay for the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs \nthat the lender may incur through other parties for obtaining the \ncredit report.  \n \n Continued on next page   \n\n--- PAGE 121 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-5 \n 1.

However, some \nspecial underwriting considerations also apply and can be found in Chapter 7 \nof this handbook . \n \nf. Refinancing \nLoans  The underwriting standards det ailed in this chapter apply to purchases and \nregular “cash -out” refinances.  IRRRLs  generally do not require any \nunderwriting unless the loan is delinquent.  IRRRLs made to refinance VA \nloans 30 days or mo re past due must be submitted to VA for prior approval \nunderwriting.  The underwriter must have concluded that:  \n \n• the circumstances that caused the delinquency have been corrected, and  \n• the Veteran can successfully maintain the new loan.  \n \nRefer to Chapter 6 of this handbook for details on all types of refinancing \nloans.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 123 ---\n  VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-72. Income – Required Documentation and Analysis\nChange Date  September 26, 2019 \n•Subsection k has been updated for clarification.\na. \nUnderwriter’s \nObjectives  It is the underwriter’s  objective to identify and verify income available to \nmeet:  \n•the mortgage payment,\n•other shelter expenses,\n•debts and obligations, and\n•family living expenses.\nb. Effective\nIncomeIncome is considered effective when it is determined to be verifiable, stabl e \nand reliable, and anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future. Income \nanalysis is not an exact science.  It requires the lender to underwrite each loan \non a case -by-case basis, using good judgement and flexibility when warranted.\nTo determine whether income is stable and reliable, the probability of \ncontinued employment must be determined through examination of the:  \n•borrower’s past employment record,\n•borrower’s training, education, and qualifications for his or her current\nposition, and/or\n•type of employment.\nOnly verified income can be considered in the repayment calculation.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 124 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-8 \n 2. Income – Required Documentation and  Analysis , continued  \n \nc. Spousal \nIncome  Verify and treat the income of a spouse who will be contractually obligated on \nthe loan the same as you would the income of a Veteran borrower that will be \nobligated on the loan.  However, to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act (ECOA), do not ask questions about the income of the \nborrower’s spouse unless the:  \n \n• spouse will be contractually liable,  \n• borrower is relying on the spouse’s income to qualify,  \n• borrower is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance \npayments from the  spouse or former spouse, or  \n• borrower resides and/or the property is in a community property state.   \n \nIn community property states, information concerning a spouse may be \nrequested and considered in the same manner as for the borrower, even if the \nspouse w ill not be contractually obligated on the loan.  See Topic 5, subsection \na, of this c hapter for additional guidelines for community property states when \nconsidering a spouse’s debts and credit history.  \n \nThe non -purchasing spouse’s (NPS) credit history does  not need to b e \nconsidered; however, the NPS’  liabilities must be considered to determine the \nexten t of the household liabilities.  \n \nd. ECOA \nConsiderations  Always inform the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) that they do not have \nto divulge information on the receipt of child support, alimony, or sep arate \nmaintenance.  However, for this income to be considered in the loan analysis, \nit must be divulged and verified.  \n \nIncome cannot be discounted because of sex, marital status, age, race, or oth er \nprohibite d bases under ECOA.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 125 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-9 \n 2. Income – Required Documentation and  Analysis , continued  \n \ne. Income from \nNon-Military \nEmployment  Verify a minimum of 2 years  of employment.  Generally, in the borrower’s \ncurrent position, 2 years of employment is a positive indicator of continued \nemployment.  \n \nIf the borrower has been employed by the present employer less than 2 years:  \n \n• verify prior employment , plus present employm ent covering a total  of \n2 years, or  \n• provide an explanation of why 2 years of employment could not be \nverified,  \n• compare any different types of employment verifications obtained \n(such as Verification of Employment (VOE), paystub(s), W2s, and tax \nreturns) for consistency, and  \n• clarify any substantial differences in the data that would have a bearing \non the qualificati on of the borrower(s).  \n \nUse of Employment Verification Services  \n \nLenders may use any employment verification service that provides the same \ninformation as the “full” verification generated through the “Work Number” \nfor all applicants. Generally, this will  include the following information:  \n \n• the current date,  \n• employer name and address,  \n• Veteran’s full legal name, social security number (compl ete or \ntruncated) and job title,  \n• employment status (Active or Inactive),  \n• length of employment and start date,  \n• salary r ate and pay frequency,  \n• average hours per pay period,  \n• summary of year to date information including base pay, ov ertime, \ncommissions and bonuses,  and \n• reference number for the verification.  \nContinued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 126 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-10 \n 2.

Previously, \nVA required an original VA Form 26 -8497. The requirements for obtaining a \npaystub have not changed. Hence, the paystub may be an original or a copy \ncertified by the lender to be a true copy of the original.  \n \nThe lender may not charge a fee to obtain the employment verification \ninformation.  \n \nVerificat ion with VA Standard Documentation  \n \nAcceptable verification consists of  VA Form 26 -8497 , Request for Verification \nof Employment (VOE) or any format which furnishes the same information as  \nVA Form 26 -8497, plus:  \n \n• paystub(s) covering the most r ecent 30-day period with year -to-date \ninformation, if the employer normally provides a pay stub(s) to the \nborrower.  \n• if the employer does not indicate the probability of continued \nemployment on the VOE,  the lender is not required to request anything \nadditional on that subject.  \n \nThe VOE and pay stub(s) must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for \nnew construction) from the closing date.  \n \n• For loans closed automatically, the date of the VOE and pay stub(s ) \nmust be within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for \nnew construction) from the closing date.  \n• For prior approval loa ns, the date of the VOE and pay stub(s) must be \nwithin 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 \ndays for  new construction) from the closing date.  \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 127 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-11 \n 2.

Additional documentation for a borrower(s) employed in building trades \nor other seasonal or climate -dependent work must provide, in addition to the \nstandard documentation (VOE and pay stub(s)), the following:  \n \n(a)  Documentation of the borrower’s total earnings year -to-date,  \n \n(b)  Signed and dated individual income tax returns for the previous 2 years, \nand \n \n(c)  If borrower works out of a union, evidence of the union’s history with \nthe borrower.  \n \nAlternative Verification Documentation  \n \nAlternative documentation may be submitted in place of a VOE if the lender \nconcludes that the borrower’s income is stable, reliable, and anticipated to \ncontinue  for the foreseeable future; that is, if the borrower’s income qualifies \nas effective income.  T wo years  of employment with the same employer is not \nrequired to reach this conclusion.  \n \nAlternative documentation consists of:  \n \n• paystub(s) covering at least the most recent 30-day period with year -to \ndate information,  \n• W-2 Forms for the most recent 2 year s, and/or  \n• telephone verification of the borrower’s current employment.  \n  Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 128 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-12 \n 2.

Alternative documentation cannot be used.  \n \nPaystub(s) and W -2 forms may be originals, electronic, or copies certified by \nthe lender to be true copies of the originals.  \n \nf. Borro wers \nEmployed for \nLess than 12 \nMonths  Generally, employment less than 12 months is not considered stable and \nreliable.  However, the lender may consider the employment stable and \nreliable if the facts and documentation warrant such a conclusion.  \n \nDetermine  whether the borrower’s past employment, training , and/or \neducation equipped him or her with particular skills that relate directly to the \nduties of their current position.  \n \nIf the probability of continued employment is high based on these factors, then \nthe lender may consider  including the income in the total effective income.   \n \nAn explanation of why income of less than 12 months duration was used must \nbe documented on the VA 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis . \n \nIf the probability of continued employment is good, but not well supported, the \nlender may utilize the income if the borrower has been  employed at  \n12 months, to partially offset debts of 6 to 24 months duration.

Recent \nHistory of \nFrequent \nChanges of \nEmployment  Short -term employment in a present position combined with frequent changes \nof employment in the recent past requires special consideration to determine \nstability of income.

Income from \nOvertime \nWork, Part \nTime Jobs, \nSecond Jobs, \nand Bonuses  Generally , such income cannot be considered stable and reliable unless it has \ncontinued and is verified for 2 years.  To include income from these sources as \nincome:  \n \n• the income must be consistent,  \n• there must be a reasonable likelihood that it will continue in the \nforeseeable future based on its compatibility with the hours of duty and \nother work conditions of the borrower’s primary job and,  \n• how long the borrower has been empl oyed under such an arrangement.  \n Contin ued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 130 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-14 \n 2.

Income from \nCommissions  Verify comm ission income by obtaining the VOE or other written verification \nwhich provides the following:  \n \n• the actual amount of commissions paid year-to-date,  \n• the basis for payments (salary plus commission, straight commission, or \ndraws against commission, or other), and  \n• when commissions are paid bi -weekly, monthly, quarterly, \nsemiannually, annually, or other.  \n• individual income tax returns, signe d and dated, plus all applicable \nschedules for the previous 2 years (or additional periods if needed to \ndemonstrate a satisfactory earnings record).  \n \nAnalyze Income  Derived from C ommissions   \n \nGenerally, income from commissions is considered stable when the  borrower \nhas obtained such income for at least 2 years.  Employment for l ess than 2 years \ncannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous \nrelated employment and/or specialized training.  Employment of l ess than 1 \nyear can rarely qua lify; however, in -depth development is required for a \nconclusion of stable income on less than 1 year cases.  \n \nFor a borrower who will qualify using commission income of less than 25  \npercent  of the to tal annual employment income, IRS Form 2106  expenses are \nnot required to be deducted from income even if they are reported on IRS Form \n2106 . Additionally, the expenses are not required to be added as a monthly \nliability for the borrower.  \n \nFor a borrower earni ng commission income that is 25 percent  or more of \nannual employment income, IRS Form 2106  expenses must be deducted from \ngross commission income regardless of the length of time the borrower has \nfiled the expenses with the IRS.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 131 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-15 \n 2.

Self -\nEmployment \nIncome \nAnalysis \nGuideline , \ncontinued  Analyze Income Derived from Self -Employment  \n \nGenerally, income from self -employment  is considered stable when the \nborrower has obtained such income for at least 2 years.  Less-than-2-years \ncannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous \nrelated employment and/or specialized training.  Less-than-1-year can rarely \nqualify; however, in -depth development is required for a conclusion of stable \nincome on less -than-1-year cases.  \n \nDetermine whether the business can be expected to generate sufficient income \nfor the borrower’s future needs.  \n \nIf the business shows a steady or significant decline in earnings over the \nperiod analyzed, the reasons for such decline must be analyzed to determine \nwhether the trend is likely to continue or be reversed.  \n \nIf it is difficult to determine the probability of co ntinued operation, obtain \ndocumentation on the viability and potential future earnings, and an \nexplanation of the function and financial operations of the b usiness from a \nqualified party.  \n \nDeductions and Expenses Claimed on Tax Returns  \n \nDepreciation claime d as a deduction on the tax returns and financial \nstatements of the business may be included in effective income.  \n \nBusiness or roll over losses must be considered from all tax returns.  \n \nWhat is reported to the IRS on a joint return must be used when applyi ng for a \nfederally guaranteed loan.  \n \nOn a joint tax return, the loss must be deducted from the borrower’s income in \nboth community and non -community property states.  \n \nOn a joint tax return, when a borrower and co -borrower have been faced with \nbusiness loss es, the Veteran/borrower and his/her spouse may want to consider \nboth being on the loan in order to potentially qualify.  The credit of both \nborrowers will be considered.  \n  Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 133 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-17 \n 2.

The LES must be an original, electronic, or a copy \ncertified by the lende r to be a true copy of the original.     \n \nThe LES must furnish the same information as a VOE and must be no more \nthan 120 days old (180 days for new construction), from the date of closing.  \n \nFor loans closed automatically, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of \nthe date the note is signed (180 days for new construction).  \n \nFor prior approval loans, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the \ndate the application is received by VA ( 180 days for new construction).  \n \nIn addition, identify servic emembers who are within 12 months of release \nfrom active duty or  the end of their contract term. For an enlisted \nservice member,  find the date of expiration (ETS) of the borrower’s current \ncontra ct for active service on the LES.  For National Guard or Reserve \nmembers, find the ETS of the borrower’s current contract on the LES.  Also, if \na National Guard or Reserve member is currently serving on active duty, also \nidentify the expira tion date of the  current active -duty tou r.

Such allowances include , but are not limited to:  \n \n• proficiency pay, such as linguistic, parachute, scuba,  flight or hazard \npay, and  \n• overseas or combat pay (sea pay, submarine, etc.)  \n \nAll types of allowances above are subject to periodic review and/or testing of \nthe recipient to ascertain  whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if \nit can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be \nexpected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, \nshould the income be added to base pay. Co ntact the borrower’s chain of \ncommand if there are questions regarding  the continuance of the income.  \n \nIf the duration of the military allowance cannot be determined, this source of \nincome may still be used to offset short term obligations of 6 to 24 month s \nduration.  \n \nConsult the IRS to determine if any allowances for pay are considered taxable \nincome by the IRS, unlike housing, clothi ng, and subsistence allowances.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 137 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-21 \n 2.

Income and \nAnalysis of \nIncome from \nService in the \nReserves or \nNational Guard  Income derived from service in the Reserves or National Guard may be used if \nthe borrower has served in such capacity for a period of time sufficient to \nindicate a  good probability that such income will continue beyond 12 months. \nThe total period of active -duty and reserve service may be helpful in this \nregard.  Otherwise, this income may be used to offset obligations of 6 to 24 \nmonths du ration.  \n \nIncome from Recently Activated Members of the Reserve or National \nGuard  \n \nLenders must consider if a borrower, whose income is being used to qualify \nfor a loan, may have a change in income due to participation in a \nReserves/National Guard unit subject to activation.  \n \nIf an activated Reserves/National Guard member applies for a loan, they must \npresent orders indicating their current active duty tour is not to exceed 12 \nmonths.   \n \nExample : The borrower’s full -time civilian employment is $3,000 per month.  \nThe borrower’s current income from the Reserves due to activation is $3,500 \nper month and orders are for 12 months.  Since the borrower’s full -time \ncivilian employment is only $3,000 per month, the $3,000 shou ld be used to \nqualify the borrower.  \n \nThere are not any clear -cut procedures that can be applied to all cases.  \nEvaluate all aspects of each individual case, including credit history, \naccumulation of assets, overall employment history, and make the best \ndecision for each loan regarding the use of income in qualifying for the loan.  \n \nIt is very important that loan files be carefully and thoroughly documented, \nincluding any reasons for using or not using Reserve/National Guard income \nin these situations.  \n \nAs a lender, the goal is to provide the Veteran their benefit without placing \nhim/her in a financial hardship.  \nContinued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 138 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-22 \n 2.

Verification \nand Analysis of \nIncome of \nRecently \nDischarged \nVeterans or \nVeterans to be \nDischarged \nfrom the \nMilitary , \ncontinued  Analysis of Prospects for Continued Employment  \n \nCases involving recently discharged Veterans often require the underwriter to \nexercise a great deal of judgment and flexibility in determining whether the \nemployment income will continue in the foreseeable future.  This is because \nsome Veterans may have little or no employment experience oth er than their \nmilitary occupation.   \n \nContinuity of employment is essential for a Veteran with no retirement \nincome , or insufficient retirement income , to support the loan obligation.  If \nthe duties the borrower performed in the military are similar or dir ectly related \nto the duties of the present position, use this as one indicator that the \nemployment is likely to continue.  \n \nMost cases fall somewhere between these extremes.

This rental income may not be included in effective income.  \n \nObtain a working knowledge of the local rental market.  If there is not a lease \non the propert y, but the local rental market is very strong, the lender may still \nconsider the prospective rental income for offset purposes.  Provide a \njustification on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis.  \n    \nReserves are not needed to offset the mortgage payment on the property the \nVeteran occupies prior to the new loan.  \n \nExample : The Veteran’s current home has a VA mortgage with a monthly \nPITI payment of $1,000.  Bonus entitlement is being used to purcha se a new \nprimary residence and the Veteran will rent the previous home for $1,200 \nmonthly upon closing of the new home.  The payment of $1,200 can be used \nto offset the existing mortgage payment, if all the above conditions are met.  \nThe additional rent re ceived in excess of the mortgage payment cannot be used \nas effective income.  \n \nVerification of Rental Property Income  \n \nObtain the following:  \n \n• documentation of cash reserves totaling at least 3 months mortgage \npayments (PITI), and  \n• individual income tax returns, signed and dated or lender obtained tax \ntranscripts, plus all applicab le schedules for the previous 2 years, \nwhich show rental income generated by the property.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 142 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-26 \n 2.

Automobile \nor Similar \nAllowances  Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related \nto a borrower’s employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset \na corresponding car payment.  However, if the borrower reports an allowance \nas part of monthly quali fying income, it must be determined if the automobile \nexpense reported on IRS Form 2106  should be deducted from income or \ntreated as a liability.  \n \nIf the reported expense is less than the automobile  allowance, the amount can \nbe treated as income and added to borrower’s monthly income.  \n \nIf the reported expense exceeds the automobile allowance, the amount must be \ndeducted from income as a net calculation in Section D on VA Form 26 -6393 , \nLoan Analysis . \n \nLikewise, any other similar type of allowance received by the borrower should \nbe considered with regards to the tax returns for determination of an offset of \nthe corresponding obligatio n, as income, or as an expense.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 146 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-30 \n 2.

Select the state listed on the LES for the state taxes \nto be co nsidered in state tax deductions.  \n \nThe lender may consider the borrower’s potential tax benefits from obtaining \nthe loan (for example, mortgage interest deduction) in the analysis.  To do so:  \n \n• determine what the borrower’s withholding allowance will be, usi ng \nthe instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W -4, Employee’s \nWithholding Allowance Certificate, and  \n• apply that withholding number when calculating Federal and state \nincome tax deductions on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , then  \n• document the change in deductions in Item 47, Remarks, on VA Form \n26-6393 , Loan Analysis . \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 149 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-33 \n 3.

The certified indebtedness can be comprised of a \nloan incurred by the  borrower to acquire a principal residence or a qualified \nhome improvement rehabilitation loan.  \n \nThere is an IRS annual limit on the tax credit equal to the lesser of the \nborrower’s maximum tax liability or $2,000.  Calculate the tax credit by \napplying the  specified percentage to the interest paid on the certified \nindebtedness.  Then apply the annual limit.  \n  \nExample : The MCC shows a 30 percent rate and $100,000 certified \nindebtedness.  The borrower will pay approximately $8,000 in annual \nmortgage interest.   The borrower’s estimated total Federal income tax liability \nis $9,000.  Calculate the tax credit as follows:  \n \nStep Procedure  \n1 30 percent of $8,000 = $2,400  \n2 Apply the IRS annual $2,000 limit  \n3 The tax credit will be $2,000  \nThis allows use of $167 (one-twelfth of $2,000) as income to qualify the \nborrower.  \n \nIf the mortgage on which the borrower pays interest is greater than the amount \nof certified indebtedness, limit the interest used in the tax credit calculation to \nthat portion attributable to the  certified indebtedness.  \n \nSince these programs are offered by state and local government(s), pre -\napproval by VA is not required for the borrower to participate in the program.  \nThe lender is responsible to determine all eligibility requirements are met by \nthe borrower to participate in the program.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 150 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-34 \n 3.

Assets and \nAmount of \nCash Required \nfor Closing  February 22, 2019  \n• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \n \nThe borrower(s)  must have sufficient cash assets to cover:  \n \n• any closing costs, pre -paids, or discount points which are the \nborrower’s responsibility and are not financed into the loan, and  \n• the difference between the sales price and the loan amount, if the sales \nprice exc eeds the reasonable value established by VA (i.e. negative \nequity).   \n \nVA does not require the borrower(s) to have additional cash to cover a certain \nnumber of mortgage payments, unplanned expenses or other co ntingencies on \nthe residence, or re finance of th e Veteran’s  residence.   \n \nHowever, the borrower’s ability to accumulate liquid assets and the current \navailability of liquid assets for unplanned expenses should be considered in the \noverall credit analysis.  \n \nReserves are required for borrowers using renta l income to qualify.  See Topic \n2, subsection n of this c hapter  for more information .   \n \nA rental offset does not require additional assets  to cover PITI.

In addition, verify any liquid assets that may have a bearing \non the o verall credit analysis (significant assets). Use VA Form 26 -8497a , \nRequest for Verification of Deposit , or electronic, or certified copies of the \nborrower’s last two bank statements.  \n \nVerifications must be no more 120 days old  (180 days for new construction).  \n \nFor automatically closed loans, this means the date of the deposit verification \nis within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new \nconstruction).  \n \nFor prior approval loans, this means the date of the deposit verification is \nwithin 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for \nnew co nstruction).  \n \nc. Pending Sale \nof Real Estate  In some cases, the determination that the income and/or assets of borrowers \nare needed to qualify for the loan d epends upon the sale of presently the \nborrower’s owned real property.   \n \nThe sale proceeds may be necessary to:  \n \n• clear the outstanding mortgage(s) against the property,  \n• pay outstanding consumer obligations,  \n• make a down payment or pay closing costs on the V A loan, and/or  \n• restore previously used VA entitlement.  \n \nEvidence the sale has been completed should be included  in the closing \npackage to verif y proceeds from the sale.    \n \nAs an alternative, the Veteran may sell the property with the buyer assuming \nthe o utstan ding mortgage obligation.

Verification \nRequirements \nfor Debts and \nObligations  February 22, 2019  \n• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \n \nAll debts and obligations of the borrowers’ must be verified and rated. Obtain \na credit report with all information for all credit  bureaus.   See Topic 7, \nsubsection a of this c hapter for details on the type of credit report required.   \nFor obligations not included on the credit report which are revealed on the \napplication or t hrough other means, the lender must obtain a verification of \npayment history showing the obligation or other written verification directly \nfrom the creditor, including the payment amount and outstanding balance.  \nThe lender must also separately verify acco unts listed as “will rate by mail \nonly” or “need written authorization.”  \n \nWhen a pay stub(s) or LES indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate \nthe nature of the allotment to determine whether the allotment is related to a \ndebt or other obligation( s).  Examples may include 401K obligation or \nrepayment, child care, child support, or other.  \n \nFor obligations that have not been rated on the credit report or elsewhere, \nobtain the verification and rating directly from the creditor.  Include a written \nexplanation for any obligation that is not rated.  \n \nResolve all discrepancies prior to closing.  If the credit report, deposit \nverification, bank statement, or pay stub(s) reveals any debts or obligations \nwhich were not divulged by the borrowers):  \n \n• obtain clar ification as to the status of such debts from the borrower(s), \nthen \n• verify any remaining discrepancies with the creditor.  \n \nCredit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old  (180 days \nfor new construction).  \n \nFor automatically closed loans,  this means the date of the credit report or \nverification is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new \nconstruction).  \n \nFor prior approval loans, this means the date of the credit report or verification \nis within 120 days of the date  the application is received by VA (180 days for \nnew construction).  \n                                                                                        Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 155 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-39 \n 5.

A \nVeteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a \nsatisfactory risk even though  the non -purchasing spouse’s credit may \nbe unsatisfactory.  \n• Include the monthly payment of the non -purchasing spouse’s debts on \nthe VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis . For debts such as judgm ents and \nunpaid collection accounts, lenders should consider the Veteran’s \ncapacity to address the debt(s).  \n• Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the \nspouse’s credit report, such as where the judgment was filed and \nwhether the parties  were married to one another at the time, and secure \na competent legal opinion whether the judgment may become a lien \nagainst the property . \n• Exclude the monthly payment on the spouse’s debts from the loan \nanalysis when a reliable source of income for the sp ouse is verified to \nreach such a conclusion which is voluntarily provided.  \n• Document VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , with an explanation of \nfacts and determination when concluding credit worthiness of the \nVeteran or excluding obligations of the non -purchasing spouse.  \nContinued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 156 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-40 \n 5.

Verification \nof Alimony and \nChild Support \nObligations  The payment amount of any alimony and/or child support obligation of the \nborrower must  be verified.  \n \nDo not request documentation of a borrower’s divorce unless it is necessary to \nverify the amount of a ny alimony or child support liability indicated by the \nborrower.  If, however, in the routine course of processing the loan, the lender \nencounters direct evidence (such as, in the credit report) that a child support or \nalimony obligation exists, they shoul d make any inquiries necessary to resolve \ndiscrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification.  \n \nSpousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26 -\n6393 , Loan Analysis . \n \nChild support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan \nAnalysis . \n \nc. Analysis of \nDebts and \nObligations  Significant debts and obligations include:  \n \n• debts and obligations with a remaining term of 10  months or more; that  \nis, long -term obligations, and  \n• accounts with a term  of less than 10 months that require payments so \nlarge as to cause a severe impact on the family’s resources for any \nperiod of time.  \n \nExample : Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a \nremaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months, \nwould be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a \nsevere impact on the family’s resources durin g the first, most critical, months \nof the home loan.  \n \nDetermine whether debts and obligations which do  not fit the description of \n“significant” should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an \nimpact on the borrower’s ability to prov ide for fa mily living expenses.  \n                                                                                                  Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 157 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-41 \n 5.

Analysis of \nDebts and \nObligations , \ncontinued  If a married Veteran wants to obtain the loan in his or her name only, the \nVeteran may do so without regard to the spouse’s debts and obligations in a \nnon-community property state.  However, in community property states, the \nspouse’s debts and obligations must be considered even if the Veteran wishes \nto obtain the loan in his o r her name only.  See Topic 2, subsection c of this \nchapter.  \n \nDebts assigned to an ex -spouse  by a divorce decree will not generally be \ncharged against a borrower.  This includes  debts that are now delinquent.  \n \nd. Borrower(s) \nas Co -\nobligor/Co -\nsignor on a \nLoan or \nObligations  The borrower(s) may have a contingent liability based on co -signing a loa n. \nThe lender may exclude the loan payments from the monthly obligations \nfactored into the net effective income calculation in the loan analysis if:  \n \n• there is evidence that the loan payments are being made by someone \nelse and the obligation is current, and  \n• there is not a reason to believe that the borrower will have to \nparticipate in repayment of the loan.  \n \ne. Pending Sale \nof Real Estate  A borrower(s) may have a current home and the sale of the real property is \nneeded to complete the transaction.  The lender may disregard the payments \non the outstanding mortgage(s) and any consumer obligations which the \nVeteran intends to clear if available information provides a reasonable basis \nfor concluding the equity to be realized from the sale will be sufficient for this \npurpose.  See Topic 4, subsection c of this c hapter for necessary documents.  \n \nf. Secondary \nBorrowing  If the borrower(s) plans to obtain a second mortgage simultaneously with the \nVA-guaranteed loan , include the second mortgage payment as a signifi cant \ndebt.  From an underwriting standpoint, the Veteran must not be placed in a \nsubstantially worse position than if the entire amount borrowed had been \nguaranteed by VA.   See Chapter 9 of  this handbook  for VA limi tations on \nsecondary borrowing.  \nContinu ed on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 158 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-42 \n 5.

Secondary \nBorrowing , \ncontinued  If the borrower(s) provides written evidence that the student loan de bt will be \ndeferred at least 12 months beyond the date of closing, a monthly payment \ndoes not need to be considered.  \n \nIf a student loan is in repayment , or scheduled to begin within 12 months from \nthe date of VA loan closing, the lender must consider the anticipated monthly \nobligation in the loan analysis and util ize the payment established by \ncalculating each loan at a rate of five  percent of the ou tstan ding balance \ndivided by 12 months.  \n \nExample :  A borrower has a $25,000 student loan balance and you multiple it \nby 5%, which equals $1,250.  This amount ($1,250) is divided by 12 months to \nequal a monthly payment of $104.17.  \n \nIf the payment(s) reported on  the credit report for each student loan(s) is \ngreater than the threshold payment calculation above in a above, the lender \nmust use the payment recorded on the credit report.  \n  \nIf the payment(s) reported on the credit report is less than the threshold \npaym ent calculation above , in order  to count the lower payment, the loan file \nmust contain a statement from the student loan servicer that reflects the actual \nloan terms and payment information for each student loan(s).  \n \nThe state ment(s) must be dated within 6 0 days of VA loan closing , and may be \nan electronic copy from the student loan servicer’s website or a printed \nstatement provided by the student loan servicer.  \n \nIt is the lender’s discretion as to whether the credit report should be \nsupp lemented with this information.  \n \ng. Loans \nSecured by \nDeposited \nFunds  Certain types of loans secured against deposited funds (signature loans, cash \nvalue life insurance policies, 401(k) loans, or other) in which repayment may \nbe obtained through extinguishing the asset, do not require repayment \nconsideration for loan qualifi cation.  \n \nThe assets required to secure a loan(s) may not be included as an asset on the \nVA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis .  \n                                                                                       Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 159 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-43 \n 5.

VA Form 26 -\n8937, \nVerification of \nVA Benefits  The lender is responsible for obtaining the necessary title search to ensure \nthere are no encumbrances that would preclude the borrower from obtaining a \nloan.  \n \n \nThe lender is respons ible for obtaining the necessary title search to ensure \nthere are no encumbrances that would preclude the borrower from obtaining a \nloan.  \nGenerally, VA Form 26 -8937 , Verification of VA Be nefits , is not needed \nunless the COE or new IRRRL case number indicates to submit the form to \nVA before closing.  However, ask the Veteran and any Veteran co -obligors \n(including spouse if a Veteran) if he or she:  \n \n• will be discharging within the next 6 mont hs from the military and has \ncompleted a PEB or MEB and will be filing for VA disability while \nstill on active duty,  \n• has recently filed for VA disability and compensation , or VA pension , \nand VA has not yet made a determination,  \n• would be entitled to receive  VA d isability benefits, but in receipt of \nretirement pay , \n• has received VA disability benefits in the past, or  \n• is an unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran (has applied and/or in \nreceipt of DIC who died on active d uty or as a result of a  \nservice -connect ed disability.  \n \nIf the Veteran falls under one of the above categories , follow the procedures \ndiscussed in Topic 2, subsection m of this chapter.  \n \nWhen VA returns the form to the lender and the form indicates that the \nborrower has any of the following:  \n \n• an outstanding indebtedness of VA overpaid education, compensation, \nor pension benefits,  \n• an education or direct home loan in default,  \n• an outstanding indebtedness resulting from payment of a claim on a \nprior VA home loan, or  \n• a repayment plan for an y of these debts that is current,   \n \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 161 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-45 \n 6.

CAIVRS is a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \nmaintained computer information system which enables participating lenders \nto learn when a borrower has previo usly defaulted on a federally -assisted loan. \nMore information can be found  at:      \nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/caivrs  \n \nThe database includes default information from the Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Education, Department of Justice, HUD, Small Business \nAdministration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and VA.  \n  \nThe VA default information included in the datab ase relates to:  \n \n• overpayments on education cases,  \n• overpayments on disability benefits income, and  \n• claims paid due to home loan foreclosures which resulted in a debt of \nthe government (Generally type 2 VA loans).  \n \nCAIVRS Procedures  \n \nA CAIVRS inquiry must be performed for all borrowers and co -borrowers \n(Veteran or non -Veteran) on all VA loans, including IRRRLs. The one \nexception to this policy is that CAIVRS is not required for non -purchasing \nspouses in community property states.  \n \nVA ass igns a 10 -digit VA lender identification number (ID) to each new \nlender, then automatically forwards the ID number to HUD with a request to \ngrant the lender CAIVRS access.  The lender can begin accessing CAIVRS \nusually between 7 to 10 business days after r eceiving its VA ID number \nassignment.  \n \nTo register for CAIVRS access for first time users,  please use the following \nlink: https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/f57register.cfm . \n \nPlease direct questions concerning problems encountered with accessing \nCAIVRS to caivrs_admin@hud.gov .  \n \nIf the borrower(s) is found to have a delinquent federal debt through CAIVRS, \nthe validity and delinquency status of the debt should be verified by contacting \nthe creditor agency using the contact phone number and case number reflected \non the borrower’s CAIVRS report.  \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 163 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-47 \n 6. Debts Owed to the Federal  Government , continued  \n \nc. What is th e \nCredit Alert \nVerification \nReporting \nSystem \n(CAIVRS)? , \ncontinued  The creditor agency that is owed the debt can verify that the debt has been \nresolved.  Documentation should be included in the loan file and an \nexplanation must be provided on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis .  It is not \nnecessary for CAIVRS to update the number if documentation is included in \nthe loan file.  \n \nOnce screening is complete, enter the CAIVRS confirmation code on VA \nForm 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , in the space to the right of the “no” block in \nitem 46 for purchase and refinances.   \n \nFor IRRRLs, enter the code on VA Form 26 -8923 , IRRRL Worksheet,  in the \nNotes section.  \n \nd. Borrower \nwith Presently \nDelinquent \nFederal Debts  When CAIVRS or another source indicates that  the borrower has a delinquent \nFederal debt, the following steps must be taken:  \n \n• Suspend processing of the loan application to determine the reason for \nthe non “A” number.  \n• Give full considerati on to  the CAIVRS information, and any \nsubsequent clarifying information or documentation provided, in \napplying VA credit standards.  Any non “A” number received does not \nautomatically disqualify a Veteran from using their home loan benefit; \nhowever, the lender must document and jus tify the approval. See Topic \n7, subsection b of this c hapter for documentatio n and explanation \nrequirements.  \n• If a previous VA loan is involved that resulted in a debt to the \ngovernment (due to foreclosures, short sale, deed in lieu, or  other), the \nborrower may contact  the VA Debt Management Center at 1-800-827-\n0648 or at dmc.ops@va.gov  to make arrangements to repay the debt.  \n \nGenerally , only type 2 VA loans ( fifth digit of the VA loan number) result  in a \ndebt to VA and are reported.  The Veteran’s entitlement cannot be restored \nuntil the debt to VA is paid in full.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 164 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-48 \n 6. Debts Owed to the Federal  Government , continued  \n \nd. Borrower \nwith Presently \nDelinquent \nFederal Debts , \ncontinued  If the fifth digit of the previous loan number is a  type 6 VA loan, there is \ngenerally a loss to the government and the loss is not reported to CAVIRS .   A \nloss to VA does not need to be repaid; however, the Veteran’s previously used \nentitlement to guaranty the previous VA loan is not restored until the loss is \npaid in full.    \n \nEach agency has their timeliness requirements before removing a non “A” \nCAV IRS finding.  This does not preclude the Veteran or borrower from \nreceiving a VA loan if credit standards are me t for VA loans.  See Topic 4.07 b \n(13 and 14) of this Chapter for guidelines after a bankruptcy or foreclosure.  \n \nExample :  A borrower suffered a  loss on a FHA loan home loan 2 years ago.  \nWhile HUD has not remo ved the CAIVRS finding as the 3 -year waiting period \nhas not passed for FHA, the lender is eligible to continue processing a VA \nloan without an “A” CAIVRS finding due to the borrower(s) meeting VA \ncredit guidelines for foreclosures and documented in the loan file.  \n \nCAIVRS information is only for the lender’s and borrower’s use in processing \nthe loan application.

Treatment of \nFederal Debts  A borrower(s) cannot  be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she is \npresently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government until \nthe delinq uent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangement \nhave been made between the borrower and the Federal agency.  \n \nExample :  A borrower has delinquent taxes and payments have not been made \nfor several years.  The establishment of a payment plan  after the CAVIRS \nfinding has been addressed may not be sufficient to show a satisfactory \npayment arrangement to repay the obligation.  \n \nA borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she has a \njudgment lien against his or her proper ty for a debt owed to the Government \nuntil the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 165 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-49 \n 7.

Credit \nReport \nStandards  February 22, 2019  \n• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \nCredit Reports used in an alyzing VA loans must be either Three -file Merged \nCredit Reports (MCR), or  Residential Mortgage Credit Reports (RMCR).  \n \nThe credit report must be less than 120 -days old (180 days for new \nconstruction).  For automatically closed loa ns and prior approval loans, the \ndate of the credit report must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed \n(180 days for new construction).  \n \nIf an RMCR is used, the standards applicable to a RMCR include, but are not \nlimited to, the following:  \n \n• The report must be prepared by a reputable credit reporting agency.  \n• Each account with a balance must have been checked with the creditor \nwithin 90  days of the date of the credit report.  \n \nFor each debt listed, the report must provide the creditor’s name, date t he \naccount was opened, high credit, current status, required payment, unpaid \nbalance, and payment history.  \n \nThe report must name at least two national repositories of credit records \ncontacted for each location in which the borrower has resided during the m ost \nrecent 2 years (separate repository inquiries are required for any co -borrowers \nwith individual credit records).  \n \nThe report must include all available public records information that is not \nconsidered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act  (15 U.S.C. § 1681) \nsuch as bankruptcies, judgments, law suits, foreclosures and tax liens.  \n \nThe RMCR must be an original  or electronic report, with no erasures, \nwhiteouts, or alterations.  \n \nThe report must contain a 24 -month employment and residency history.  \n \nVA may decline to accept a credit report which does not meet these standards.  \n \nIf possible, the cost of the credit re port must be listed on the credit report.  If \nnot possible, an itemized invoice identifying the borrower(s) is required to \nverify the cost on the Closing Disclosure Statement (CD) when charging the \nborrower for the credit report.  \n  Continued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 166 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-50 \n 7. Credit History – Required Documentation  and Analysis , \ncontinued  \n \nb. How to \nAnalyze Credit  The borrower’s past repayment practices on obligations is the best indicator of \nhis or her willingness to repay future obligations.  Emphasis should be on the \nborrower’s overall payment patterns rather than isolated occurrences of \nunsatisfactory repayment.  Determine whether the borrower (and spouse, if \napplicable) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a careful analysis of the credit \nreport and other credit data.  \n \nVA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.    \n \nRent and Mortgage Payment History  \n \nThe borrower’s most recent 24-month  rental history and any outstanding, \nassumed, or recently retired mortgages must be verified and rated.  Housing \nexpense payment history is often a primary indicator of how motivated the \nborrower is to make timely mortgage payments in the future.   \n \nAbsence of Credit History  \n \nFor borrower(s) with no established credit history, base the de termination on \nthe borrower’s payment record on alternative or nontraditional credit directly \nfrom the borrower or creditor in which a payment history can be verified.  \nAbsence of a credit history is not generally considered an adverse factor.   \n \nIt may re sult when:  \n \n• borrower(s) has not yet developed a credit history,  \n• borrower(s) has routinely used cash rather than credit, and/or  \n• borrower(s) has not used since some disruptive credit event such as \nbankruptcy or debt pro -ration through consumer credit counse ling. \n \nAccounts in the Spouse’s Name  \n \nSee Topic 2, subsection c in this chapter for ECOA and consideration of the \nspouse’s credit history.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 167 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-51 \n 7.

How to \nAnalyze Credit , \ncontinued  Adverse Credit Data  \n \nIn circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally \nconsidered to be re-established  after the borrower(s), have made satisfactory \npayments for 12 months after the date the last derogatory credit item was \nsatisfied.  If a credit report reveals numerous unpaid collections and/or \naccounts that are not being paid timely, including some which  have been \noutstanding for many years, then once the borrower has satisfied the \nobligations, and then makes timely payments on subsequent obligations for at \nleast 12 months, satisfactory credit is considered re -established.   \n \nCollection Accounts  \n \nIsolated  collection accounts do not necessarily have to be paid off as a \ncondition for loan approval.  A credit report may show numerous satisfactory \naccounts and one or two unpaid medical (or other) collections.  In such \ninstances, while it would be preferable to  have collections paid, it would not \nnecessarily be a requirement for loan approval.   \n \nHowever, collection accounts must be considered part of the borrower’s \noverall credit history and unpaid collection accounts should be considered \nopen, recent credit.   \n \nBorrowers with a history of collection accounts should have re-established  \nsatisfactory credit in order to be considered a satisfactory credit risk.   \n \nWhile VA does not require that collection accounts be paid -off prior to closing \nif the borrower’s over all credit is acceptable, an underwriter must address the \nexistence of the collection account(s) with an explanation on VA Form 26 -\n6393 , Loan Analysis , for excluding the negative credit h istory they represent.    \n \nIf the collection account is listed on the credit report with a minimum \npayment, then the debt should be recognized at the minimum payment amount.  \n  Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 168 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-52 \n 7. Credit History – Required Documentation  and Analysis , \ncontinued  \n \nb. How to \nAnalyze Credit , \ncontinued  Charged off Accounts  \n \nThese accounts are typically collections in which the creditor is no longer \npursuing collection of the  account.  The underwriter must address the \ncircumstances regarding the negative credit history when reviewing the overall \ncredit of the borrower(s).  \n \nDisputed Accounts  \n \nLenders may consider a Veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses \nregarding unpaid  debts except when the debt has been reduced to judgment.   \n \nThe underwriter should document the reason(s) for not considering an account \non VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis . \n \nJudgments  \n \nAccount balances reduced to judgment by a court must either be paid in full or \nsubject to a repayment plan with a history of timely payments.   \n \nA history of timely payments would be generally considered as making 12 \npayments to reestablish credit.   \n \nHowe ver, in certain cases wh en a judgment has only been in place for a few \nmonths, an underwriter could justify on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , a \nshorter repayment history if the documenta tion indicates the borrower \nimmediately addressed the ju dgment after it was filed  and began a repayment \nplan.  \n \nPayoff of Unpaid or Untimely Debts  \n \nFor unpaid or debts that have not been paid timely, pay -off of these debts after \nthe acceptability of a borro wer's credit is questioned does not alter the \nunsatisfactory record of payment.  A period of making timely payments on \nsubsequent obligations for at least 12 months, then satisfactory credit is \nconsidered re-established .   \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 169 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-53 \n 7.

How to \nAnalyze Credit , \ncontinued  Consumer Credit Counselin g Plan  \n \nIf a borrower(s) has prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer \nCredit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk \nif they demonstrate 12 months’ satisfactory payments and the counseling \nagency approves th e new credit. If a borrower(s) has good prior credit and are \nparticipating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be \nconsidered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining \ncreditworthiness.  Do not treat this as a negative credit item if the borrower \nentered the  Consumer Credit Counseling plan before reaching the point of \nhaving bad credit.  \n \nBankruptcy  \n \nThe fact that a bankruptcy exists in a borrower (or spouse’s) credit history \ndoes not in itself disqualify the loan.  Develop complete information on the \nfacts and circumstances of the bankruptcy.  Consider the reasons for the \nbankruptcy and the type of bankruptcy filing.  \n \nBankruptcy Filed Under the Straight Liquidation and Discharge \nProvi sions of the Bankruptcy Law (Petition under Chapter 7 of the \nBankruptcy Code):  \n \n• If the bankruptcy was discharged more than 2 years ago from the date \nof closing for purchases and refin ances, it may be disregarded.   \n• If the bankruptcy was discharged within t he last 1 to 2 years, it is \nprobably not possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a \nsatisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are \nmet: \n \nRequirement  Explanation  \n1 The borrower(s) had obtained consumer items on credit \nsubsequent to the bankruptcy and has satisfactorily made \nthe payments over a continued period.  \n2 The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the \ncontrol of the borrower or spouse such as unemployment, \nprolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance, \nand so on, and the circumstances are verified.  Divorce is \nnot generally viewed as beyond the control of the \nborrower and/or spouse.  \n \n  Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 170 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-54 \n 7.

How to \nAnalyze Cre dit, \ncontinued  If the bankruptcy was discharged within the past 12 months, it will generally not be \npossible to determine  that the borrower(s) is a satisfactory c redit risk.  \n \nIf the bankruptcy was caused by failure of the business of a self -employed borrower, \nit may be possible to determine that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk if all \nfour of the following are met:  \n \nRequirement  Explanation  \n1 The borrower  obtained a permanent position after the \nbusiness failed.  \n2 There is not any derogatory credit information prior to the \nself-employment.  \n3 There is not any derogatory credit information subsequent to \nthe bankruptcy.  \n4 Failure of the business was not due  to the borrower’s \nmisconduct.  \n \nBankruptcy Petition Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code  \nThis type of filing indicates an effort to pay creditors.  Regular payments are made \nto a court -appointed trustee over a 2 to 3 -year period or, in some cases, up to 5 \nyears, to pay off scaled down or entire debts.  \n \nIf the borrower(s) has finished making all payments satisfactorily, the lender may \nconclude that the borrower has re-established  satisfactory credit.  \n \nIf the borrowers) has satisfactorily made at least 1 2 months’ worth of the payments \nand the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit, the lender may \ngive favorable consideration.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 171 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-55 \n 7.

How to \nAnalyze Credit , \ncontinued  Foreclosures  \n \nThe fact that a home loan foreclosure (or deed -in-lieu or short sale in lieu of \nforeclosure) exists in a borrower(s) history does not in itself disqualify the loan.  \nDevelop complete information on the facts and circumstances of the \nforeclosure.  \n \nYou may disregard a foreclosure finalized more than 2 years from the date of \nclosing.  If the foreclosure was finalized within the last 1 to 2 years from the \ndate of closing, it is probably not possible to determine that the borrower(s) is a \nsatisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are met:  \n \nThe borrower (s) has obt ained consumer items on credit subsequent to the \nforeclosure and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued period, \nand \n \nThe foreclosure was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the \nborrower (s) such as unemployment; prolonged strikes, medical bills not \ncovered by insurance, and so on, and the circumstances are verified.   \n \nIf a foreclosure, deed in lieu, or short sale process is in conjunction with a \nbankruptcy, use the latest date of either the discharge of the bankruptcy or \ntransfer o f title for the home to establish the beginning date of re -established \ncredit.  If there is a significant delay in the transfer of title , the lender should \ncontact the RLC of jurisdiction for guidance.  \n \nDeed in lieu or short sale  \n \nFor a deed in lieu or sho rt sale, develop complete information on the facts and \ncircumstances in which the borrowers) voluntarily surrendered the property.  If \nthe borrower’s payment history on the property was not affected before the \nshort sale or deed in lieu and was voluntarily  communicating with the servicer \nor holder, then a waiting period from the date transfer of the property may not \nbe necessary.  \n \nIf the foreclosure, deed and  lieu or short sale was on a VA -guaranteed loan, \nthen a borrower may not have full entitlement avail able for the new VA loan.  \nEnsure that the borrower’s COE reflects sufficient entitlement to meet any \nsecondary market ing requirements of the lender.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 172 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-56 \n 8.

General AUS \nInformation  February 22, 2019  \n• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \n \nVA has approved Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, Fannie Mae’s Desktop \nUnderwriter, and VA approved proprietary lender AUS systems to use in \nconnection with VA -guaranteed home loans.  These systems incorporate VA’s \ncredit standards and processing requirements.  \n \nLenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases \nprocessed with approved AUS.  The level of reduced documentation depends \non the risk classification assigned.  The systems use different  terminology such \nas Approve or Accept.  The tables in this section give a general description of \ndocumentation waivers.  Please note that the documentation requirements are \nthe same for these cases as for non -AUS cases, except for any differences cited \nin the tables.  \n \nThe automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely \ndetermine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders underwriter’s decision \nwhether or not to approve the loan.   \n \nAlthough VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.  \nThe terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider \nof these systems.  \n \nIt is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system \nbe accurately verified.  The data utilized by the system must be supported by \nsource documentation obtained by the lender.  Inaccurate or unverified data \nwill result in invalidation of the risk classification.  Under certain \ncircumstances, it could also result in a finding of material misrepresentation, \nwhich co uld affect the validity of the guaranty.   \n\n--- PAGE 173 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-57 \n 8.

The \nfollowing steps are required to dete rmine the debt-to-income ratio:  \n \n \nThe “Debt -to-Income Ratio” heading in Topic 10, subsection b of this chapter \ncontains special procedures to apply if the ratio exceeds 41 percent.  \n \nOnly the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual \nincome.   \n \nCare should be exercised to ensure that the income considered tax -exemp t is \nlikely to continue and remain untaxed.   \n \nTax-free income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, \nworkers’ compensation benefits, disability retirement payments, and certain \ntypes of public assistance payments.

Debt -to-\nIncome Ratio, \nItem 44 , \ncontinued  Verify that the income is indeed tax -free before “grossing up.”   \n \nTax-free income may be “grossed up” for purposes of calculating the debt -to-\nincome ratio only.  \n \n• This is a tool that may be used to lower the debt ratio for borrowers \nwho clearly qualify for the loan.   \n• “Grossing up” involves adjusting the income upward to a pre -tax or \ngross income amount which, after deducting state and Federal income \ntaxes, e quals the tax -exempt income.   \n• Use current IRS and state income tax withholding tables to determine \nan amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower’s \nactual income. Use a figure of 125 percent  of the borrower’s non -\ntaxable income when “gro ssing up.”  \n• Do not add non -taxable income to taxable income before “grossing \nup.” \n• If “grossing up” is used, indicate such and provide the “grossed up” \nratio of 125  percent  in item 47, “Remarks.” The actual amounts of the \nborrower’s non -taxable income should  not be adjusted in in line 38.  \n \ng.

Residual \nIncome  February 22, 2019  \n• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \nVA’s minimum residual incomes (balance available for family support) are a \nguide.  They should not automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  \nInstead, consider residual income in conjunction with all other credit factors.  \n \nHowever, an inadequate residual income alone can be a basis for disapproving \na loan.   \n \nIf residual income is marginal, look to other indicators such as the borrower’s \ncredit history, and in particular, whether and how the borrower has previously \nhandled similar housing expense.  \n \nConsider the ages of the borrower’s dependents in determining t he adequacy \nof residual income.  \n \nb. Debt -to \nIncome Ratio  VA’s debt -to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing \nexpense, installment debts, and other obligations listed in section D of VA \nForm 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , to gross monthly income.  It is a guide  and, as \nan underwriting factor, it is secondary to the residual income.  It should not \nautomatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  Instead, consider the \nratio in conjunction with all other credit factors.  \n \nA ratio greater than 41 percent  requires close scrutiny unless:  \n \n• the ratio is greater than 41 percent unless it is larger due solely to the \nexistence of tax -free income which should be noted in the l oan file), \nthe loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's \nsupervisor,  or \n• residual income exceeds the guideline by at least 20 percent.  \n \nLoans closed automatically with a debt-to-income ratio greater  than 41 \npercent:  \n \n• Include a statement justifying the reasons for approval, signed by the \nunderwriter’s supervisor, unless residual income exceeds the guideline \nby at least 20 percent.  \n• The statement must include the reason(s) for approving the loan and \nlist the compensating factors justifying a pproval of the loan.  \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 187 ---\n    VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n4-71 \n 10. How to Analyze the Information  on VA Form 26 -6393, \nLoan Analysis , continued  \n \nc. Credit \nHistory  A poor credit history alone is a basis for disapproving a loan.  \n \nIf credit history is marginal, look to other f actors such as residual income.  \n \nd. \nCompensating \nFactors  Compensating factors may affect the loan decision.  These factors are \nespecially important when reviewing loans which are marginal with respect to \nresidual income or debt -to-income ratio.  They cannot be used to compensate \nfor unsatisfactory credit.   \n \nValid compensating factors should represent strengths rather than mere \nsatisfaction of basic program requirements.  For example, the fact that a \nborrower has sufficient assets for closing purposes, or meets the residual \nincome guideline, is not a compensating  factor.  \n \nValid compensating factors should logically be able to compensate (to some \nextent) for the identified weakness in the loan.  For example, significant liquid \nassets may compensate for a residual income shortfall whereas long -term \nemployment would not. \n \nCompensating f actors include, but are not limited to the following:  \n \n• excellent credit history , \n• conservative use of consumer credit,  \n• minimal consumer debt,  \n• long-term employment,  \n• significant liquid assets,  \n• sizable down payment,  \n• the existence of equity in refinancing loans,  \n• little or no increase in shelter expense,  \n• military benefits,  \n• satisfactory homeownership experience,  \n• high residual income,  \n• low debt -to-income ratio,  \n• tax credits for child care, and  \n• tax benefits of home ownership  \nContinued on  next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 188 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26 -7, Revised  \nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting  \n \n4-72 \n 10.

Compare \nPrevious and \nProposed \nShelter \nExpenses  Closely scrutinize a case in which the borrower will be paying significa ntly \nhigher shelter expenses than he or she currently pays.   \nConsider the:  \n \n• ability of the borrower to accumulate liquid assets, and  \n• amount of debts incurred while paying a less amount for shelter.  \n \nIf a borrower’s application shows little or no reserves  and excessive \nobligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in \nshelter expenses can be absorbed.  \n \nf. Home \nMortgage \nDisclosure Act \n(HMDA)  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  (HMDA) data, many \nlenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate \nmeasures to assure access by minorities and lower income househol ds to home \nmortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be aware of \nhow effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in meeting this \ngoal.  \n \nCompatibility of VA Program with HMDA  \n \nThe no down payment feature is, of course, a prim ary advantage for \nindividuals with low -to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not \noverlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans \nfor such borrowers.  VA Credit Standards are written as guidelines and are \nmeant to be in terpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration all of \nan individual loan borrower’s financial, employment and family \ncircumstances.   \n \nPurpose of HMDA  \n \nVA encourages underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which \nought to be appr oved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of \nthe credit standards.   \n \nUnderwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible \nappropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications for \nevery qualified Vete ran. \n \n\n--- PAGE 189 ---\nChapter 5 How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \nOverview \n \nIn this Chapter This chapter contains  the following topics. \n \nTopic Topic See Page \n1 Processin g Procedures 5-2 \n2 How to Submit Loan Documents to VA 5-5 \n3 Prior Approval Loan Procedures 5-6 \n4 Automaticall y Closed Loan Procedures 5-16 \n5 Other Necessar y Documents to Submit 5-21 \n6 Processing Loan Assumptions  by the Current Servicer \nor Holder of the VA Loan 5-22 \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 190 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-2 1. Processing Procedures \n \nChange Date April 1, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na. Order of \nCompletion The procedures discussed in this topic must be initiated and may be completed \nin any feasible order, with the excep tion of the Certificate of Eligibility \n(COE), as long as they are all complete d prior to loan clos ing.  The COE must \nbe obtained prior to ordering an apprai sal.  These proce dures apply to both \nprior approval loans and loans closed  automatically (except the procedure \nwhich specifically refers to prior approval loans). \n \nTo avoid delays in closing, it is recommended that the lender take the \nfollowing actions in the very early stages of loan processing:  \n obtain a COE (see subsection b of this chapter), \n request an appraisal assignment in VA’s web-based loan guaranty \nsystem (WebLGY), (see Chapter 10 of  this handbook for the steps to \norder an appraisal), \n initiate the Credit Alert Verificati on Report System (CAIVRS) and, if \napplicable, a complete VA Form 26-8937 , Verification of VA Benefits , \n(see Topic 6, Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook), \n request a credit report and verificatio ns (see Topic 7, Chapter 4 of this \nhandbook). \n \nb.  How to \nObtain a Certificate of Eligibility Verify the Veteran’s or surviving spouse’s eligibility for home loan benefits \nand amount of available entitlement by obtaining a COE in WebLGY.  It is \nhighly suggested that lenders obtai n a COE online through WebLGY for the \nmost efficient processing times.  Ve terans may also apply online through \neBenefits. A COE obtained by the borrower in eBenefits will be in WebLGY.  \nThis COE can be accessed by the lender using at least two of the requested data points in the system, for exampl e the reference number and Veteran’s \nsocial security number.  An additiona l or updated COE does not need to be \nobtained or updated unless a change need s to be made to the COE.  Please \nexamine and understand the conditions of the COE. Failure to comply with \nthe COE conditions may result in an ineligible loan (see Chapter 2 of this handbook).  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 191 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-3 \n 1. Processing Procedures , continued  \n \nc.  Establish \nReasonable \nValue of the Property After ordering an appraisal in WebLGY, the appraisal report is uploaded into \nWebLGY.  The Staff Appraisal Reviewer will review the appraisal and issue \nthe Notice of Value (NOV).  A copy of the NOV will be available in WebLGY.  The lender must obtain ev idence of compliance with any NOV \nrequirements.  \n \nd.  Determine if \nVA’s Occupancy \nRequirement is \nMet Determine whether the Veteran meets VA’s occupancy requirement.  The \nloan cannot be closed as a VA loan unl ess the requirement is met (see Chapter \n3 of this handbook for occupancy requirements).  \n \ne.  Underwrite \nthe Loan Complete the procedures, verifications, and VA Form 26-6393 , Loan \nAnalysis , described in Chapter 4 of th is handbook.

Examples may \ninclude, but not limited to:  \n \n resolving differences in th e number of dependents, and \n resolving the amount or status  of monthly obligation(s). \n The final signed Uniform Reside ntial Loan Application (URLA), VA Form \n26-6393 , Loan Analysis , and final Automated Syst em Feedback, should all \nreflect the same  information.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 192 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-4 1. Processing Procedures , continued  \n \nf. Requirements \nfor Active Duty Servicemembers Ensure every active duty Servicemem ber who applies for a loan is \ncounseled through the use of VA Form 26-0592 , Counseling Checklist for \nMilitary Homebuyers , as early as possible in the transaction. \n \nThe active duty Veteran’s and lender’ s signature on the form signifies \ncounseling has been completed. \n \nEnsure the Veteran, eligible as an ac tive duty member, is still on active duty \nat the time of closing if the COE indicates: “Valid unless discharged or \nreleased subsequent to date  of this certificate.  A certification of continuous \nactive duty as of the da te of note is required.”   If the lender becomes aware \nthat the applicant is no longer on acti ve duty, the loan may not be closed \nunless VA re-establishes the Vete ran’s eligibility as follows: \n \n A Veteran released from active duty must have a DD214  Form \n(member copy 4) with time served, Character of Service Discharge, \nand reason for the discharge liste d. It must be uploaded into \nWebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. \n \n A Veteran released from the National Guard or Reserves must have \nevidence of time served and an Honor able discharge. This must be \nuploaded into WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. \n \n If a COE was issued based upon activ e duty service and the Veteran \nhas been separated, eligibility must be re-determined based upon their len\ngth of service and character of service.   \n \ng.  Obtain a \nCertificate of Commitment on Prior Approval \nLoans Upload to WebLGY all prior approval lo ans for review (see Topic 4 of this \nchapter).  \n \nOnce approved by VA, the Regional Loan Center (RLC) will issue a VA Certificate of Commitment.  Ensure co mpliance with any co nditions listed on \nthe Certificate of Commitment  before closing the loan.  \n \nTo obtain the loan guarant y certificate, the closing package must be uploaded \ninto WebLGY, for the RLC’s final review.  \n\n--- PAGE 193 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-5 \n 2. How to Submit Loan Documents to VA  \n \nChange Date April 1, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na.  Where and \nWhen to Submit Documents Generally, lenders only need to submit documents to VA when the loan \nrequires prior approval or VA requests copi es of the origination package for a \nFull File Loan Review (FFLR).  Lenders must use WebLGY, accessed via the Veterans Information Portal, to submit all requested documents.   \n \nb.  VA Loan \nNumber A 12-digit VA Loan Identification Numb er (LIN) is assigned to each loan by \nVA at the time the appraisal or Intere st Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan \n(IRRRL) is requested. Use this number el ectronically in VA systems or where \nrequested on VA forms and other docum ents.  Submitting an incorrect VA \nloan number can dela y processin g of the guarant y. \n  \nc.  Who Can \nSign Documents for the Lender? Under certain circumstances, VA requi res specific parties to execute \ndocuments. For example: \n \n a VA-approved underwriter must appr ove or disapprove a loan for a \nnon-supervised automatic lender, \n an officer of the company must  sign the Lender’s Loan Quality \nCertification. \n \nWhere VA does not have a specific requirement, branch managers, \nemployees, and agents of the lender or  holder may execute VA forms in the \nname of, and on behalf  of, the principals. \n  \nd.  Use of \nElectronic Documents When submitting loan documents to  VA, lenders may use electronic \ndocuments.  Lenders must be able to provide VA’s audit team members with \nprinted, digital, or on-line access to records. \n \nLenders are expected to continually mon itor the integrity of their electronic \nsystem to ensure consistent quality a nd to prevent unauthori zed alternation or \ndestruction of records. \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 194 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-6 3. Prior Approval Loan Procedures \n \nChange Date April 1, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na.  Loans to be \nSubmitted for \nPrior Approval Lenders without automatic authority are strongly enc ouraged to enter into a \nsponsor/agent relationship with a VA-a pproved automatic lender to expedite \nVA loan processing and underwriting.  If a lender does not have a sponsor, \nthen they must submit an application to  VA for prior approval lending.  Those \nwithout sponsors or automatic authority  must upload all loans into WebLGY \nfor prior approval, except IRRRLs made  to refinance loans that are not \ndelinquent (see Chapter 1 of this handbook).  \n \nLenders must upload all prior approv al documents into WebLGY, for RLC \nreview (see Subsection c of this Topic) .  A user’s guide for uploading prior \napproval loans is available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/ documents/docs/prior_approval_LP_le\nnders.pdf.  \n \nAll lenders, whether or not they have  automatic authority, must submit the \nfollowing types of loans to  VA for prior approval: \n \n joint loans, except Veteran-Veteran as a married couple (see Chapter 7 \nof this handbook) \n loans to Veteran in receipt of VA nonservice-connected pension.  This \nis not the same as VA disability – in come based (see Chapter 7 of this \nhandbook) \n loans to Veterans who have a VA Fiduciary (see Chapter 7 of this \nhandbook) \n IRRRLs made to refinance delinquent  loans (See Chapter 6 of this \nhandbook) \n manufactured home loans (home is  not titled as real-estate) \n supplemental loans \n \nNote :  COEs may indicate to submit VA Form 26-8937 , Verification of VA \nBenefits .  The form is completed by the VA RLC of jurisdiction where the \nproperty is located, and will indicate  whether the Veteran receives VA non-\nservice connected pension or has a VA Fiduciary.

While VA cannot make the final underwrit ing determination without reviewing \nthe loan, the VA RLC can discuss VA guidelines found in this handbook to \nassist the underwriter in making a determination.   \n VA cannot address overlays established by a company or investor and the loan \nshould not be submitted as a prior ap proval for the lender to overcome any \ncompany or invest or requirements. \n The lender must furnish a cover letter with  the uploaded file that states the \nreason(s) for the prior approval su bmission and explains any unique \ncircumstances.  In addition, the cove r letter must incl ude the submitting \nunderwriter’s name, phone number, e-ma il address and his or her manager’s \nname, phone number, and e-mail address.   Do not use this provision to shift the burden of a loan denial to VA. \n \n The lender must perform the following step s prior to submitting a loan package \nfor prior approval:   \n establish the reasonable value of th e property with the issuance of an \nNOV, \n underwrite the loan and provide a completed and legibly signed VA \nForm 26-6393 , Loan Analysis , and \n ensure active duty members receive counseling using VA Form 26-\n0592 , Counseling Checklist fo r Military Homebuyers . \n The loan package will be returned and processing delayed if all documents are \nnot submitted with the original upload.  \nContinued on next page \n \n\n--- PAGE 196 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-8 3.

E ither the VA Pension or \nFiduciary HUB may have, in addition to Loan Guaranty, to provide a review \nof the loan file. \n \ng. Certificate of \nCommitment \n  \nVA‘s certificate of commitment must be obtained prior to closing and is the \nlender’s evidence of VA’s willingness to  guaranty the loan.  The lender is \nsubsequently entitled to evidence of guaranty if the:  \n the closed loan is identical in a ll respects to that submitted to VA on \nthe URLA and described on the certif icate of commitme nt (or, if not \nidentical, any required VA approval of  changes was obtained prior to \nclosing), and \n the lender has complied with all a pplicable provisions of the law and \nloan guaranty regulations in making the loan.  Additionally, all conditions of the certificate of commitment mu st be met. \n If, at any time prior to closing, the lender or VA has reason to doubt the \ncontinued qualification of the loan, th e lender will delay closing until all facts \nare determined and reviewed again by VA.  VA may cancel a commitment if the validity period of the certificate of commitment has expired (after 180 da ys), and there is no reasonable \nexpectation that the loan will be reported for guaranty.   \n A commitment may be extended under ce rtain circumstances.

Processing Loan Assumptions by the Current Servicer or \nHolder of the VA Loan  \n \nChange Date April 1, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na.  General \nInformation  If you are not the loan servicer or hold er of the current VA loan, please refer \nthe borrower or purchaser to the servicer  or holder of the current VA loan for \nprocessing.  Assumptions can only be pr ocessed and closed by loan holders \nand services with VA automatic author ity that are holding or servicing the \ncurrent VA loan.    Loan holders or servicers holding the loan without VA automatic authority that are holding or servicing the curre nt VA loan, may submit a prior approval \npackage to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. See \nTopic 1 of this chapter.   \nA VA assumption is also considered a Release of Liability (ROL).  \n Properties that are security for VA-gua ranteed loans may be disposed or \ntransferred even though the loans are not pa id in full. Veterans who dispose or \ntransfer their properties under these c onditions remain liable to VA for any \nloss that may occur as a result of a future default and subsequent claim \npayment, unless the proper ty is transferred to a creditworthy purchaser who \nagrees to assume the payment obligation.  The servicer initially determines the \npurchaser’s creditworthiness.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 211 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-23 \n 6. Processing Loan Assumptions by the Current Servicer or \nHolder of the VA Loan, continued  \n \na. General \nInformation, continued  Any purchaser may qualify to assume  a VA loan; however, for a Veteran’s \nentitlement to be restored, a Veteran purchaser with sufficient entitlement \nmust complete a Substitution of Entitle ment (SOE) when the ROL is closed.  \nThe Veteran’s entitlement is not restor ed unless the Veteran purchaser, in \naddition to assuming the payment obligati on, also agrees and is eligible to \nsubstitute their entitlement for the Vetera n seller’s entitlement . It is important \nfor the servicer as soon as possible in  the assumption process to obtain COEs \nfor both the Veteran assumer and Vetera n seller to determine if there is \nsufficient entitlement in which to su bstitute. See chapter 3 of this handbook. \n Unless the ROL is an unrestricted transfer , a closing disclosu re is required.  \n An ROL or SOE does not affect th e original issuance of the LGC.  \n \n \nb.  Who Can \nProcess Loan \nAssumptions?   While procedures for processing requests  for assumption approvals previously \ndepended on the date of loan (comm itment made on or after March 1, 1988), \nthe VA Loan Electronic Reporting Inte rface (VALERI) regulations authorize \nloan holders or servicers with automatic authority that are holding or servicing \nthe current VA loan to be transferre d to determine creditworthiness on all \nassumption approval requests processed b y their servicers. \n \nc.  Servicers \nwith Automatic Authority Servicers with automatic authority are authorized to process and determine \ncreditworthiness on assumption approval re quests on behalf of VA.  Servicers \nmust follow VA underwriting guidelines  (see chapter 4 of this handbook) \nwhen processing and determining creditworthiness on these cases. \n  Servicers must notify VA electronically of  authorized ownership transfers and \napproved ROLs in VALERI.  Additiona l information on the reporting process \nis available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/valeri.asp . \n An underwriting and closing package must  be uploaded into WebLGY, for the \nexistin\ng VA loan number.   \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 212 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-24 6.

Transfers of \nOwnership on Properties with Loan \nCommitments \nafter March 1, 1988 Transfers of ownership on properties securing loans for which commitments \nwere made on or after March 1, 1988, must  have the prior approval of the loan \nholder or its authorized servicing agen t if either of them have automatic \nauthority.  If neither the holder no r the servicer has automatic authority, the servicer must \nsubmit a credit package to VA for underwriting.   A seller must apply for approval of the tr ansfer prior to completing the sale.   \n \nServicers and holders with automatic au thority must examine the application \nto assess compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714 .  VA will make \nthe determination in a case where ne ither the servicer nor the holder has \nautomatic authority, following receipt of  a complete applic ation package from \nthe servicer or holder.  \nContinued on next page \n \n  d.  Servicers \nwithout Automatic \nAuthority Servicers without automatic authority that are servicing loans for holders \nwith automatic authority must advise the holders of any assumption approval \nrequests, and the holders will be  responsible for determining \ncreditworthiness.   When neither the servicer nor the holder  has automatic authority, the servicer \nmust develop a complete credit package and submit it, along with a copy of the purchase contract and the status of the loan to the Loan Production \nsection at the VA RLC where th e property is located.    \n The package should contain a cove r letter indicating prior approval \nunderwriting is required as both the servicer and the holder do not have VA \nautomatic authority.

Approval \nRequirements To approve the transfer of ownership: \n \n the loan must be current or will be  brought current at the closing of \nthe sales transaction, \n the prospective purchaser of th e property is creditworthy, as \ndetermined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook, and \n the prospective purchaser has agr eed to assume all of the loan \nobligations, including the obligation to indemnify VA if a claim is paid. \n A processing fee may be collected in advance, including a reasonable \nestimate for the cost of the credit repo rt.  The maximum fee for processing a \nrequest for assumption approval and cha nging the loan records is the lesser \nof:  \n automatic authority – $300 plus the actual cost of a credit report; or \n no automatic authority – $250 plus the actual cost of a credit report; \nor \n any maximum prescribed by applicable state law. \n VA does not specifically regulate when th e processing fee may be assessed.  \nHowever, when the processing fee is collected prior to signing the sales \ncontract, the portion of the fee attributab le to changing the servicer’s records \n(usually $50) must be returned to the sell er if the applicati on is denied or the \nprocess is not completed.

Processing \nTime \nGuidelines Automatic Authority: Servicers or hold ers with automatic authority must \ncomplete the underwriting and notify the seller of the decision within 30 \ncalendar days after receiving a comp lete ownership transfer approval \napplication package.  Without Automatic Authority: Servicers without automatic authority (where the holder also does not ha ve automatic authority) must submit documents to \nVA within 21 days after receiving a complete application package.   VA Review: VA has 10 business days to  complete its underwriting review \nand notify the servicer of its decision.  Servicers have 7-calendar days to \nnotif\ny all parties of VA’s decision. \n \nh.  Decision \nNotices Approvals:  If the application for ownership transfer is approved, the servicer \nmust notify the seller and include instru ctions for the assu mption of liability \nby the purchaser, the amount of fund ing fee that must be paid, and \ndocumentation needed to complete the process. \n \nDisapprovals: If the application is disa pproved, the seller a nd purchaser must \nbe notified.  The disapprova l notice must include: \n \n the reason(s) for the decision and a notice that the decision may be \nappealed to VA within 30 calendar days, \n contact information of the servi cer including address, phone number, \nand e-mail of the servicer for VA to  request the underwriting package \nif appealed, \n if the application was disapproved for credit reasons, the purchaser \nmust be informed of the basis on which the adverse decision was \nmade in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act . \n \nIf the application remains disapproved after 45 calenda r days (to allow time \nfor an appeal and review by VA), the $50 fee for changing the account \nrecords, if previousl y collected, must be refunded. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 215 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-27 \n 6.

VA may \ndetermine that special approval of the assu mption is in the best interest of the \ngovernment if:  \n the seller agrees to re main secondarily liable  on the loan following \nassumption, \n the seller is unable to otherwise co ntinue payments on the loan, and \nreasonable efforts have been made  to find a creditworthy borrower \nfor the property, or \n if an obligor is releas ed without proper approv al, VA may be released \nfrom further liability on the guaranty. \n VA has 7 calendar days from receipt of the seller’s request to make this \ndetermination.    If approved, the VA RLC will notify the servicer and seller that the assumption has been approved and that the seller will not be released from \nliability to VA; however, the property can  be transferred to the purchaser(s). \nThe servicer should close the assumption with 30 days of VA’s special approval. \n \nIf disapproved, the VA RLC will notify the seller and lender that the assumption has not been approved, that  the seller will not be released \nfrom liabilit\ny, and the propert y cannot be transferred. \n \nj.

Owners have the right to sell \nthe property securing these loans under any terms; servicers may not impose \na restriction, charge, or fee that would limit or nullify this right.

The purchaser shoul d be afforded an  opportunity for \nretroactive approval of the transfer if: \n \n the purchaser pays the funding fee, \n the purchaser has assumed all of the seller’s obligations in the \ntransfer deed, \n the assumption language is legally binding, and  \n it appears that the purchaser inte nds to satisfy those obligations. \n \nWhen these conditions have been me t, then the Veteran and transferee \nmust specifically apply for an ROL under 38 U.S.C. 3713 .

Liability not assumed.  If prior approval of a transfer was not \nobtained and the title was transferred “subject to” the mortgage or \ndeed of trust, then the purchaser usually has no liability on the loan \nand no liability for the funding fee.

Assumptions \nwithout Prior \nApproval, \ncontinued  The original Veteran seller is sti ll liable if the home subsequently \ndefaults and VA pays a claim based on the Veteran’s entitlement used \nto guaranty the loan.  It may still be advisable to ex tend the opportunity to apply for \nretroactive approval of the transfer , with the expectation that the \npurchaser will assume liability for repayment of the loan. \n \nThe original mortgagor remains liable  on the loan unless he or she is \nreleased from personal liability with a qualifying assumption.  The \nVeteran and transferee must specif ically apply for an ROL under 38 \nU.S.C. 3713 .  See subsection a of this topic. \n \nAn ROL does not restore the or iginal Veteran’s VA home loan \nentitlement and does not affect th e guaranty on the loan. The LGC \nremains in the original Veteran’s name. \n \nAfter the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for an \nSOE to restore the Veteran seller’s  entitlement. See subsection r of \nthis topic. \n \nAn exception applies when the loan was made by a state, territorial, \nor local governmental agency and th e law requires acceleration of the \nmaturity of the loan upo n sale or transfer of the property to a person \nnot eligible for assistance unde r the special program.

If the Veteran and current owner \nwill be permitted to apply for retroactive approval, the assumption \nprocess should be completed in the same manner as if the application had been received prior to the transfer.  This includes the right of appeal to VA, if the request is denied. \n \nShould a purchaser fail to coopera te in the retroactive approval \nprocess, a servicer has the opti on of accelerating the loan.   \n When making this decision, the se rvicer should consider the \nimplications of state law when delaying acceleration as compared to the prospect of accelerating a curren t loan that has the potential for \nfuture timely payments.  Any decision must be reported to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of the \npropert\ny and in VALERI. \n \np.  General \nRelease of Liability Procedures VA-guaranteed loans dated prior to March 1, 1988, can be transferred \nwithout VA’s prior approval, borrowe rs and transferees may apply for \nan ROL before or after the cl osing of the transaction.   \n Servicers with automatic authority must process an ROL when the borrower and transferee specifi cally apply for a release. \n Servicers without automatic author ity that are servicing loans for \nholders with automatic authority must advise the holders of any \nassumption approval requests, and th e holders will be responsible for \ndeterminin\ng creditworthiness. \nContinued on next page \n \n   \n\n--- PAGE 224 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-36 6.

General \nRelease of \nLiability \nProcedures, continued  A processing charge may be assess ed for reviewing a request for an \nROL just as on a request for approv al of ownership change on a later \nloan. \n \nWhen a borrower sells his or her ho me to transfer ownership without \nrequesting an ROL, the servicer may charge up to $50 for amending \nits records to reflect a change in ownership, if the parties involved \nagree and it is permissible under the loan agreement. \n \nNo funding fee may be assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988.  \n \nq.  Release of \nLiability Procedures for \nDivorce A Veteran may seek release from personal liability when his or her \nformer spouse acquires the property as  the outcome of a legally binding \nseparation agreement or divorce pr oceedings and the ex-spouse was \njointly liable on the loan with the Veteran prior to the divorce. \n \nServicers may process requests fo r an ROL from divorced Veterans \nusing the same general procedures outlined in subsection a of this topic. \n \nWhen processing an ROL in divorce cases in which the Veteran’s former spouse receives the propert y, the servicer is authorized to \ncharge the normal processing fee to  complete the cr edit underwriting.  \nA funding fee may not be assessed. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 225 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-37 \n 6. Processing Loan Assumptions by the Current Servicer or \nHolder of the VA Loan,  continued \n \nq.  Release of \nLiability Procedures for Divorce, \ncontinued  The following requirements must be met: \n \n the divorce is final and absolu te and it is determined no \nappeal will be taken, or \n a signed separation agreemen t by all parties based on \nlocal laws and available doc uments with reasons why a \nseparation agreement is used in  lieu of a final decree of \ndivorce, and  \n the entire estate encumbered for the VA-guaranteed \nloan has become vested in the name of the Veteran’s former  spouse, and \n there is not any knowledge of  any property settlement \nthat would make the Vetera n liable between the parties \nto pay the guaranteed loan. \n \nSome states require a specific amount of time between a legal \nseparation and a divorce (up to  one year).  With proper \ndocumentation, do not delay the reques t for an ROL, if the divorce is \nnot final, but a legal separation agreement is in effect. \n \nIn some instances, the ex-spouse may also be a Veteran; however, for \nVA purposes, only the applicant w ho used their entitlement to \nguaranty the loan is c onsidered a Veteran.   \n \nFor example, John and Mary Do e are divorcing and both have \nobtained a COE; however, only J ohn’s COE was used to guarantee \nthe loan.  Since Mary’s COE was not used to guarantee the home, \nonly John is considered the Veteran.  If Mary wishes to assume the \nloan, a credit qualifying package is required for an ROL and Mary \ncan substitute her entitlement with the assumption.  When the Veteran is awarded the pr operty, the ex-spouse may seek an \nROL.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 226 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-38 6. Processing Loan Assumptions by the Current Servicer or \nHolder of the VA Loan,  continued \n \nq.  Release of \nLiability \nProcedures for \nDivorce, continued  Requests for an ROL from an ex-spouse in cases where the Veteran \nretains the property should be refe rred to the VA RLC of jurisdiction \nover the state where the property is located, to process a Non-Veteran \nSpouse (NVS) ROL.   The servicer will be provided a w ith an NVS letter indicating VA has \nreleased the non-Vetera n spouse of liability. \n \nThe servicer may only charge a fee of $50 for amending its records to \nreflect the change.   It is not necessary for the se rvicer to complete an ROL. \n \nFor example, Mary and Jon Smith divorced after they purchased a home using Mary’s COE.  She obtains the home per the divorce decree.  Since she is the Veteran and will be retaining the property, \nshe will contact the VA RLC of jurisd iction of where the property is \nlocated to process the NVS. \n \nr.  Substitution of Entitlement  \nA Veteran may allow an assump tion/ROL of his or her VA-\nguaranteed loan with the expectation of being able to have his or her \nentitlement restored.  A restorati on may be needed to obtain another \nVA-guaranteed loan in the future by restoring the previously used \nentitlement for full entitlement benefits.  Entitlement cannot be \nrestored until VA makes a determination of eligibility for the Veteran assumer and Veteran seller and processes the SOE.  VA completes the SOE process after a servicer closes the assumption and issues an ROL.  Questions about an SOE s hould be directed to the VA RLC \nwith jurisdiction where the property is located.  It is important for the servicer to  obtain a COE as soon as possible in \nthe assumption process to determine if there is sufficient entitlement for the Veteran assumer to complete the SOE for the Veteran seller.  Entitlement must be of equal amounts  to substitute.  See Chapter 3 of \nthis handbook for determination of home loan eligibility.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 227 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-39 \n 6.

Substitution \nof Entitlement, continued  When a Veteran requests approval for a transfer of ownership, he or \nshe may request to have entitleme nt restored for use on another VA \nloan. For VA to approve such a request:  \n the assumption (ROL) must be comp leted and closed by the lender; \n the purchaser must be an eligib le Veteran who has sufficient \nentitlement to substitute for th at of the original Veteran; \n the purchaser must certify that th e property securing the loan will be \noccupied as his or her residence; \n the purchasing Veteran must  agree to the SOE; and \n there must be equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran \nin order to substitute his or her entitlement with the Veteran being released of their entitlement.  \nThe assumption (ROL) must be comp leted and closed by the lender. \n \nThe purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient \nentitlement to substitute for th at of the original Veteran. \n \nThe purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be \noccupied as his or her residence. \n \nThe purchasing Veteran must agree to the SOE, and there must be \nequal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran in order to substitute his or her entitlement w ith the Veteran being released of \ntheir entitlement. \n \nWhenever two Veterans intend to follow the SOE process, the servicer should have the Veteran purchaser complete VA Form 26-\n8106 , Statement of Veteran Assuming GI Loan , (Substitution of \nentitlement).  It should be included in the closing package submitted \nto VA. \n \nA COE for each Veteran should accompany the credit package used to approve the ROL. \n \nIt is important to verify the purchasing Veteran has sufficient entitlement, is willing to  substitute their entitlement, and will meet \noccupancy requirements to substitute before the closing of the ROL to \nmeet the requirements of an SOE.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 228 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5: How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA \n5-40 6.

Unrestricted \nTransfers Certain transfers of owners hip, otherwise subject to 38 U.S.C. 3714 , \ndo not require prior approval by a ho lder or VA. Loans may not be \naccelerated due to these types of transfers. \n \nAn ROL will not be processed. \n \nProcessing charges and funding fees may not be assessed.  \n \nIt is permissible to charge a re asonable fee up to $50 for changing the \naccount records, provided that th ere is an agreement with the \nborrower and it is permissible under the loan agreement. \n Servicers must report unrestrict ed transfers to VA through VALERI \nas authorized transfers of ownershi p, which will typically be handled \nautomatically by their servicing systems.    Unrestricted transfers of ownership include: \n \n the creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the \nlender’s security instrument that do es not relate to a transfer of \nrights of occupancy in the property; \n the creation of a purchase m oney security interest for \nhousehold appliances; \n a transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death \nof a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety; \n the granting of a leasehold inte rest of 3 years or less not \ncontaining an option to purchase; \n a transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;  \n a transfer when the spouse or child of the borrower becomes a \njoint owner of the proper ty with the borrower,  \n a transfer into an inter-vivos trust in which the borrower is and \nremains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer \nof rights of occupancy in the property; and \n a transfer resulting from a decree  to dissolve a marriage, legal \nseparation agreement, or fro m an incidental property \nsettlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property. \n  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 229 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 5:  How to Process VA Loans and Submit them to VA  \n \n5-41 \n 6.

Unrestricted \nTransfers, continued  VA does not consider a sale on an in stallment contract, contract for \ndeed, or similar arrangement in which title is not transferred from the seller to the buyer, to be a “disposition” of property as sale agreements are not subject to 38 U.S.C. 3714 . \n \nThese sale agreements do not require prior approval from the servicer \nor VA.   \nBorrowers inquiring should be cautioned that any borrower \nconsidering a sale in this manner would remain liable for repayment of the loan under such an arrangement.   \n \nt.  Documentation \nRequirements  \nVA does not require a servicer to change records, even if the \nagreement calls for the contract purchaser to make payments directly to that servicer.  The contract seller is responsible for forwarding payment coupons and other information to the contract purchaser.  Depending on the circumstances of a case, servicers may agree to change the account address to read “in care of” the contract purchaser, although the contract seller must promptly advise the servicer of any change in his or her address. \n \nSales by installment contracts typically call for transfer of title after a certain period of time. \n \nIf the contract calls for title to transfer prior to payment in full of the VA loan, VA requires assumption approval according to the procedures previously discussed. \n \nProcessing charges and VA funding fees will be applicable upon transfer. \n \nAs one of the conditions of the c ontract, servicers should advise the \nborrower that the language stating an application for assumption approval will be made, and approval secured, prior to the completion of title transfer. \n \nThe contract should address the options of both parties if the request for assumption approval is denied. \n \nServicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all transfers, assumptions, and releases of liability for at least 3  years \nfrom approval or denial.  \n \nAn assumption package should be submitted to the RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 230 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-1 Chapter 6.

What is an \nIRRRL? An IRRRL is a VA-guaranteed loan made to refinance an existing VA-\nguaranteed loan, generally at a lower in terest rate than the existing VA loan, \nand with lower principal a nd interest payments than the existing VA loan.    \n Generally, no appraisal, cr edit information or unde rwriting is required on an \nIRRRL, and any lender may close an IRRRL automatically.   \n Note:  Exceptions and specific requirements are explained in the remainder of \nthis section. \n  \nb. Interest Rate \nDecrease \nRequirement An IRRRL (which can be a fixed rate , hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage \n(ARM) or traditional ARM) must bear a lower interest rate  than the loan it is \nrefinancin g unless  the loan it is refinancin g is an ARM. \n \nc. Payment \nDecrease/ \nIncrease \nRequirements The principal and interest payment on  an IRRRL must be less than the \nprincipal and interest payment on the loan being refinanced unless  one of the \nfollowing exceptions applies:  \n the IRRRL is refinancing an ARM, \n term of the IRRRL is shor ter than the term of the loan being refinanced, or \n energy efficiency improvement s are included in the IRRRL. \n A significant increase in the veteran’s monthly payment may occur with any \nof these three exceptions, especially if  combined with one or more of the \nfollowing:  \n financing of closing costs, \n financing of up to two discount points,  \n financing of the f unding fee, and/or \n higher interest rate when an ARM is bein g refinanced. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 232 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-3 1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \nc. Payment \nDecrease/ \nIncrease Requirements (continued) If the monthly payment (PITI) increase s by 20 percent or more, the lender \nmust:  \n determine that the veteran qualifi es for the new payment from an \nunderwriting standpoint; such as, determine whether the borrower can support the proposed shelter expens e and other recurring monthly \nobligations in light of income estab lished as stable and reliable, and  \n include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly \npayment which exceed s the previous pa yment b y 20 percent or more. \n \nd. Veteran’s \nStatement and Lender’s Certification For all IRRRLs, the veteran must si gn a statement acknowledging the effect \nof the refinancing loan on the veteran’ s loan payments and interest rate.  \n The statement must show the interest rate and monthly payments for the new \nloan versus that for the old loan.  The statement must also indicate how long it \nwould take to recoup ALL closing costs (both those included in the loan and \nthose paid outside of closing).    If the monthly payment (PITI) increase s by 20 percent or more, the lender \nmust include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly \npayment which exceeds the previous  payment by 20 percent or more. \n Example :   \n \n Vet’s monthly payment decreases by $50.00. \n Vet pays $5,000 in closing costs (include s all costs – closi ng costs, funding \nfee, discounts, etc). \n Recoup closing costs in 100 m onths - $5,000 divided by $50.  \n Note :  This would not be required in thos e limited cases where the payment is \nnot decreasing (reduced te rm of loan, etc.). \n The veteran’s statement may be combined  with the lender’s certification and \nshould be on the lender’s own lette rhead.  For a sample please go to: \nhttp://www.homeloans.va.\ngov/docs/VA _Rate_Reduction _Cert.pdf . \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 233 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 6:  Refinancing Loans \n6-4   1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n \ne. What Closing \nCosts can be \nIncluded in the Loan? The following fees and charges ma y be included in an IRRRL: \n \n the VA funding fee, and \n any allowable fees and charges discussed in section 2 of chapter 8 ; such as, \nall allowable closing costs, incl uding the lender’s flat charge. \n However, There Is One Limitation While the borrower may pay any reas onable amount of discount points in  \ncash, only up to two discount points can be included in the loan amount. \n Although VA does not require an appraisal or credit underwriting on \nIRRRLs, any customary and reasonable  credit report or appraisal expense \nincurred by a lender to satisfy its lendi ng requirements may be charged to the \nborrower and included in the loan. \n The lender may also set the interest rate on the new loan high enough to \nenable the  lender to pay all closing costs, as long as the requirements for \nlower interest rate and payments (or one of the exceptions to those \nrequirements) are met.  For IRRRLs to refinance loans 30 days or more past due (which must be submitted for prior approval), the follow ing can be included in the new loan: \n \n late payments and late charges on the old loan, and \n reasonable costs if le gal action to terminate the old loan has commenced. \n \nf. When Can \nthe Borrower Receive Cash at Closing? An IRRRL cannot be used to take equity  out of the property or pay off debts, \nother than the VA loan being refinanced.  Loan proceeds may only be applied to paying off the existing VA loan and to  the costs of obtaining or closing the \nIRRRL.  Therefore, the general rule is  that the borrower cannot receive cash \nproceeds from the loan.  If necessary, th e refinancing loan amount must be \nrounded down to avoid payments  of cash to the veteran. \n The one exception is reimbursement of  the veteran for the cost of energy \nefficiency improvements up to $6,0 00 completed with in the 90 days \nimmediatel\ny precedin g the date of loan closin g. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 234 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-5 1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \nf. When Can \nthe Borrower \nReceive Cash at Closing? (continued) Note : Use of loan proceeds for en ergy efficiency improvements not involving \ncash reimbursement of the veteran is also an option.  See section 3 of chapter \n7. \n \nIn a limited number of situations, the borrower may receive cash at closing.  \nSome examples of situations in wh ich VA does not object to the borrower \nreceiving cash are:  \n computational errors, \n changes in final pay-off figures, \n up-front fees paid for the appraisal and/ or credit report that are later added \ninto the loan, and \n refund of the escrow balance on the ol d loan.  This often occurs when a \nparty other than the present holder originates the loan. \n VA does not set a “ceiling” or a spec ific dollar limita tion on cash refunds \nresulting from adjus tments at closing.  However,  if a situation involves a \nborrower receiving more than $500, cons ult VA as to its acceptability.  \nLenders and VA personnel should exerci se common sense when assessing \nsuch situations and dr aw from basic program in formation to know the \ndifference between an equity with drawal and cash from unforeseen \ncircumstances. \n \ng. Maximum \nLoan Always use VA Form 26-8923 , IRRRL Worksheet, to calculate the maximum \nloan amount.  The maximum loan amount  is the existing VA loan balances \nplus the following:  \n including any late payments* and late charges, plus  \n allowable fees and charges (incl udes up to two discount points), plus   \n the cost of any energy efficiency improvements, and \n the VA funding fee. \n *Any IRRRL that includes delinquent pa yments in the loan amount must be \nsubmitted for prior approval, even when a lender has automatic authorit\ny.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 235 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 6:  Refinancing Loans \n6-6   1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \ng. Maximum \nLoan \n(continued) Note :  There is no maximum dollar amount  for VA loans.  Since an IRRRL \nrolls the above items into the new loa n, and VA guarantees at least 25 percent \nof the loan amount (without  regard to the veteran’s entitlement), the new loan \namount may be more than the limits es tablished by the secondary market.  It \nis the lender’s responsibilit y to ensure it has a marketable loan. \n  \nh. Amount of \nGuaranty and \nEntitlement Use No additional charge is made to the veteran’s  entitlement  for an IRRRL; such \nas, the amount of the veteran’s previ ously used and available entitlement \nremains the same before a nd after obtaining the IRRRL. \n The new IRRRL loan amount may be equa l to, greater than, or less than, the \noriginal amount of the lo an being refinanced.  This may impact the amount of \nguaranty on the new loan, but not the veteran’s use of entitlement.  \n Example Of New Loan Amount More Than Old Loan   \nThe existing VA loan was originally  made for $110,000 with a guaranty of \n$27,500, or 25 percent.  The new IRRRL is for $112,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $28,000 or 25 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use \nremains at $27,500.  Example Of New Loan Amount Less Than Old Loan The existing VA loan was originally  made for $42,000 with a guaranty of \n$25,000, or almost 60 percent (the percenta ge applicable under former law).  \nThe new IRRRL is for $40,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $20,000 or 50 percent, but the veteran’s en titlement use remains at $25,000. \n \nAmount How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL \nIRRRLs \nup to $45,000 First, calculate the  lesser of: \n \n 50 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or \n the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. \n The amount of guaranty is the greater of: \n \n the above result, or \n 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 236 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-7 1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \nh. Amount of Guaranty and Entitlement Use (continued)  \n \nAmount How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL \nIRRRLs\nof $45,001 to $56,250 First, calculate the lesser  of: \n \n $22,500, or \n the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. \n The amount of guaranty is the greater of: \n \n the above result, or \n 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount. \nIRRRLs\nof $56,251 to $144,000 First, calculate the lesser  of: \n \n 40 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or \n the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. \n The amount of guaranty is the greater of: \n \n the above result, or  \n 25 percent  of the IRRRL loan amount. \nIRRRLs \ngreater than $144,000 Guaranty on these is always 25 percent of the IRRRL loan \namount. \n \ni. Maximum \nLoan Term The maximum loan term is the original term of the VA loan being refinanced \nplus 10 years, but not to exceed 30 years and 32 days.  For example, if the old \nloan was made with a 15-year term, th e term of the new loan cannot exceed \n25 years. \n \nj. Title/Lien \nRequirements The IRRRL must replace the existing VA loan as the first lien on the same \nproperty.  Any second lien-holder would have  to agree to a subordinate to the \nfirst lien holder.  \n The borrower cannot pay off liens ot her than the existing VA loan from \nIRRRL proceeds. \n The veteran (or survivin g co-obli gor spouse) must still own the propert y. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 237 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 6:  Refinancing Loans \n6-8   1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \nk. Who Can an \nIRRRL be \nMade to? Generally, the party(ies) obligated on th e original loan must be the same on \nthe new loan (and the veteran must still own the property).    The lender should contact VA regard ing a proposed IRRRL involving a \nchange in obligors unless the acceptability of the IRRRL is clear.  Sample \ncases are provided in the ta ble in this subsection. \n Examples : \n In Case 7, the divorced spouse is keeping the home and wishes to refinance.  \nThe spouse cannot get an IRRRL unless th e veteran agrees to be obligated on \nthe new loan and commit his or her en titlement to the new loan.  A person \nwithout entitlement cannot get an I RRRL or any other type of VA loan. \n \nIn Cases 8 through 10, the applicants cannot obtain an IRRRL because they do not include the veteran or a person who was the veteran’s spouse at the \ntime the original loan was made, and who was obligated on the loan along \nwith the veteran.  In the case of the unmarried veteran obtaining the original loan (Case 8): \n \n the marriage and death of the veteran occurred after the loan was made, and \n the deceased veteran’s spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  Thus , \nan IRRRL is not possible. \n In the case of the veteran and spouse ob ligated on the original loan (Case 9): \n \n the divorce, remarriage, then death of  the veteran occurred after the loan \nwas made and,  \nthe deceased veteran’s new spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  \nThus , an IRRRL is not possible. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 238 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-9 1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \nk. Who Can an \nIRRRL be \nMade to? (continued) In the case of the veteran/nonveteran joint loan (Case 10): \n \n the veteran “sold out” to the nonveteran co-obligor after the loan was made \nand, \n the veteran no longer has any owne rship interest in the property. \n   Thus , an IRRRL is not possible. \n  \n \nParties Obligated on Old VA \nLoan Parties to be Obligated on new \nIRRRL Is IRRRL \nPossible? \n1 Unmarried vetera n Veteran and new spouse Yes \n2 Veteran and spouse Divorced veteran alone Yes \n3 Veteran and spouse Veteran and different spouse Yes \n4 Veteran alone Different veteran who has \nsubstituted entitlement Yes \n5 Veteran and spouse Spouse alone (veteran died) Yes \n6 Veteran and nonveteran \njoint loan obli gors Veteran alone Yes \n7 Veteran and spouse Divorced spouse alone No \n8 Unmarried vetera n Spouse alone (veteran died) No \n9 Veteran and spouse Differe nt spouse alone (veteran \ndied) No \n10 Veteran and nonveteran \njoint loan obli gors Nonveteran alone No \n \nl. Underwriting \nof IRRRLs When Obligors Have Changed Although VA does not require any credit/income documentation or  \nre-underwriting of IRRRLs when there has been a change in obligors, lenders  \nmay want to consider the following: \n \n Check mortgage payment record in lie u of obtaining a full credit report, \nunless required by investor. \n For death or divorce cases, obtain a st atement from the obligor(s) on the \nability to make payments on the new loan without the co-obligor’s income.  \n Obtain a statement about the addition of a different spouse, change in \nnumber of dependents,  as applicable.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 239 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 6:  Refinancing Loans \n6-10   1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), \nContinued \n  \nl. Underwriting \nof IRRRLs \nWhen Obligors Have Changed (continued) The lender should satisfy itself that the lower payment and interest rate, and \nthe minimum 25 percent guaranty compen sate for no re-underwriting on the \nnew loan when there has b een a change in obligors. \n  \nm. Occupancy For IRRRLs, the veteran or the spous e of an active se rvicemember must \ncertify that he or she previously occupi ed the property as his or her home.  \nThis is different than the requireme nt for non-IRRRL VA loans that the \nveteran must intend  to personally occupy the property as his or her home.     \n Reference :  See chapter 3  for details. \n   \nn. VA Loan \nIdentification \nNumber Request a new loan number for each IRRRL through The Appraisal System \n(TAS), without requesting an appraisal. \n \no. Credit \nUnderwriting No credit information or underw riting is required unless: \n \n the loan to be refinanced is 30 days or  more past due (see section 2 of this \nchapter) or, \n the monthly payment (PITI) will  increase 20 percent or more. \n \nReference :  See subsection d of this section. \n A borrower with a recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy may need approval of the \ntrustee for the new loan. \n \np. Prior \nApproval Procedures An IRRRL can be closed on an auto matic basis by any lender (such as, a \nlender with or without auto matic authority to close ot her types of loans on an \nautomatic basis) in any geographic location.   \n \nException :  For IRRRLs to refinance existi ng VA loans 30 days or more past \ndue, VA prior approval is needed (see sect ion 2, subsection a of this chapter).  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 240 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-11 1.

Prior \nApproval \nProcedures (continued) A lender may choose to submit an IRRRL  for prior approval, even if the \nexisting loan is not 30 days or more past due.  In such cases, submit only items 1 through 10 (and 17, if  applicable) of the in formation listed under \n“Prior Approval Submission.”  Also include  an explanation of why the loan is \nbeing submitted for prior approval.  Submit documents on closed prior appr oval IRRRLs in accordance with the \ninstructions under sec tion 2, subsection c of  this chapter.  \n Note : Prior approval for IRRRLs is not required  for veteran’s in receipt of \nnonservice-connected pension or for ve terans rated incompetent by VA when \nthese veterans meet the re quirements of this section. \n  \nq. Procedures \nfor Automatic Processing of IRRRLs An IRRRL can be closed on an auto matic basis by any lender (such as, a \nlender with or without auto matic authority to close ot her types of loans on an \nautomatic basis) in any geographic location.  Exception :  For IRRRLs to refinance existi ng VA loans 30 days or more past \ndue, VA prior approval is needed.  See sec tion 2, subsection a, of this chapter. \n \nA loan must be reported (such as, all documentation submitted) to VA within \n60 days of closing.

What is a VA \nCash-Out Refinancing Loan? A cash-out refinancing loan is a VA-guara nteed loan that refinances any type \nof lien or liens against the secured prope rty.  The liens to be paid off may be: \n \n current or delinquent, and \n from any source, such as \n tax or judgment liens, or \n VA, FHA, or conventional mortgages. \n \nLoan proceeds beyond the amount needed to pay off the lien(s) may be taken \nas cash by the borrower for any purpose acceptable to the lender.    The loan must be secured b\ny a first lien on the propert y. \n  \nb. Maximum \nLoan Amount The maximum loan amount is 100 percen t of the appraised value, plus the \ncost of an y ener gy efficienc y improvements, plus the VA fun ding fee. \n \nc. What Fees \nand Charges Can be Included in the Loan? Cash proceeds from the loan may be us ed to pay allowable fees and charges \nand discount points.   \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 247 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 6:  Refinancing Loans \n6-18   3.  Cash-Out Refinancing Loans, Continued \n \nd. Maximum \nGuaranty The maximum guaranty for regular (i.e., “cash-out”) refinancing loans is the \nsame as the maximum guaranty for pur chase loans.  Prior to October 10, \n2008, the maximum guaranty had been  limited to $36,000.  However, \nguaranty on this type of loan is now co mputed the same as for purchases (i.e., \ncan var y dependin g on location). \n \ne. Veteran’s \nEntitlement The veteran must have sufficient available entitlement for the loan.  If an \nexisting VA loan on the same property will be paid off by the refinancing loan, the entitlement used for that exis ting loan can be restored for purposes \nof obtainin\ng the new loan. \n   \nf. Occupancy The veteran must certify that he or  she intends to personally occupy the \nproperty as his or her home.  Reference :  See section 5 of chapter 3  for details. \n  \ng. Automatic or \nPrior Approval \nProcessing Only lenders with authority to close loans automatically may close cash-out \nrefinancing loans automatically.  All ot hers must submit these loans for prior \napproval b y VA. \n  \nh. Lender \nProcedures Loan processing procedures are virtua lly the same as fo r non-refinancing \nloans.  A full appraisal, credit info rmation, and underwriting are required.  \nGenerally, follow the procedures described in chapter 5  of this handbook. \n \nTo report loan closing, submit all of the documents required for non-\nrefinancing loans (see  chapter 5 ) plus a statement signe d by the veteran which \nshows: \n \n the cash proceeds paid, \n an itemization of the debts pa id from loan proceeds, and \n the identification of those debts secured b y liens of record. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 248 ---\n VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans  \n \n 6-19 4.

Joint Loans \n \nChange Date  March 11, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety  \n \na. What is a \nVA Joint Loan? “Joint loan” generally refers  to a loan for which the: \n \n Veteran and other person(s) are liable, and \n Veteran and the other obli gor(s) own the security. \n  A joint loan is a loan made to the:  \n Veteran and one or more non- Veterans (not spouse),  \n Veteran and one or more Veterans (not  spouse) who will not be using their \nentitlement, \n Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, and both \nentitlement will be used; or \n Veteran and one or more other Veterans (not spouse), all of who will use \ntheir entitlement. \n A loan involving a Veteran and his or her spouse will not be treated as a “joint \nloan” if the spouse is:   \n not a Veteran, or \n a Veteran who will not be using his or her entitlement on the loan. \n \nA loan to a Veteran and fiancé who inte nd to marry prior to  loan closing and \ntake title as Veteran and spouse will be  treated as a loan to a Veteran and \nspouse (conditioned upon their marria\nge), and not a joint loan.  \n \nb. Regulations The re gulations in 38 C.F.R. 36.4307 address joint loans.  \n \nc. \nTerminology Used in This Section   \n \n For purposes of applying the principles ex plained in this sect ion, this term will \nalso be used to represent any other type of joint lo an involving at least one \nVeteran using his or her entitlement, and at least one other person not using \nentitlement (can be a Veteran or a non-Veteran, but not a spouse). \n                                                                                         Continued on next page \n \n\n--- PAGE 253 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-3 1.

This may also include loans to the following:   \n The Veteran and the Veteran’s spous e who is also a Veteran, if both \nentitlements will be used.  \n Entitlement and funding fees are se parate. Funding fees are always \ncalculated equally by the number of people on the lo an.  It is based on \neach Veteran paying their e qual share of the loan.  \n On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the f unding fee is based on half of the \nbase loan amount, downpayment, and sales price for the correct funding \nfee charge. \n VA will only guarantee the Veteran’s por tion of the total loan amount.  \n  \n \nd. Occupancy  The Veteran using entitlement on a joint loan must certify intent to personally \noccupy the property as his or her home.  \n \n \ne. How Many \nUnits Can the Property Have? If a property is to be ow ned by two or more eligible Veterans, it may consist \nof four family units and one business unit, plus one additional unity for each \nVeteran participating in the ownership.  \n Thus, two Veterans may purchase or cons truct residential pr operty consisting \nof up to six family units (the basic four  units plus one unit for each of the two \nVeterans), and one business unit. \n                                                                                       Continued on next pa\nge \n\n--- PAGE 254 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-4 \n 1.

How Many \nUnits Can the Property Have? , \ncontinued  If the property contains more than four family units plus one family unit for \neach Veteran participating in the owne rship and/or more than one business \nunit, the loan is not eligible for guaranty. \n \nf. Which Joint \nLoans Require Prior Approval?  Any joint loan for which the Veteran w ill hold title to the property and any \nperson other than the Veteran’s spouse must be submitted for prior approval. \n Any loan for which the Veteran and Ve teran’s spouse will hold title to the \nproperty: whether or not the spouse also  uses entitlement, may be closed \nautomatically by the lender with automatic authority.  This type of joint loan does not have to be submitted for prior approval.  \n \nContinued on next page \n \n \n \n      \n \n   \n\n--- PAGE 255 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-5  \n1.

How to \nUnderwrite a Joint Loan The following underwriting considerations apply: \nType of Joint Loan   Underwriting Considerations Function  \nTwo Veteran Joint \nLoan Consider the credit and combined income and \nassets of both parties.  Strengths of one Veteran related to income and/or assets may compensate for income/asset weaknesses of the other.  However, satisfactory credit of  one Veteran cannot \ncompensate for the other’s poor credit.  \nVeteran/Non-Veteran \nJoint Loan  Veteran’s credit must be satisfactory and Veteran’s \nincome must be sufficient  to repay that portion of \nthe loan allocable to the non- Veteran.  The credit of \nthe non-Veteran must be satisfactory.  However, the combined income of both borrowers can be considered in evaluatin g repayment ability.   \n In other words: \n income strength of the Veteran may \ncompensate for income weakness of the non-Veteran, but  \n income strength of th e non-Veteran cannot \ncompensate for income weakness of the \nVeteran in analyzing the Veteran’s ability to repay his or her allo cable portion of the \nloan.  \n \n__________________ _______________ _______________ _______________  \n \nh. How to Calculate Guaranty and Entitlement Use on Veteran/Non- Veteran Joint Loans  \nGuaranty is limited to that portion of the loan allocab le to the Veteran’s   \nequal interest in the property. \n \nPercentage of entitlement has no bear ing on the amount of the funding fee to \nbe paid. (See Chapter 8). \n \nThe lender must satisfy itself that the requirements of its investor or the \nsecondary market can be met with this limited guaranty. \n \nContinued on next page \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 256 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-6 \n 1.

Procedure Step  Action \n1 Divide the total loan amount b y the number of borrowers.  \n2 Multiply the result by the number of Veteran-borrowers who will be \nusing entitlement on the loan.  There is usually only one Veteran borrower, in which case the result \nof this Step is the same as the result of Step 1.  \n3 Calculate the maximum potential gu aranty on the portion of the loan \narrived at in Step 2 (as if th at portion was the total loan).  \n4 VA will guarantee the lesser of: \n \n the maximum poten tial guaranty amount arri ved at in Step 3, \nor \n the combined available entitlement of all Vetera n-borrowers.  \n5 VA makes a charge to the Veteran-borrower’s available entitlement \nin the amount of the guaranty.  If more than one Veteran is invol ved, VA divides the entitlement \ncharge equally between them, if possible.  If only unequal \nentitlement is available, unequal charges may be made with the \nwritten a\ngreement of the Veterans.  \n \nContinued on next page \n \n         \n \n\n--- PAGE 257 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-7 1.

Certificate \nof Commitment For joint loans involving one or more non-Veterans the:  \n \n loan amount shown on the commitment is  limited to the Veteran’s portion \nof the loan, and \n percentage of guaranty is based on th e ratio of the amount  of entitlement \nthe Veteran has available to the Veteran’s portion of the loan.  \n VA will issue the Certificate of Co mmitment with a reminder that:  \n \n no part of the guaranty applies to the portion of the loan allocated to the \nnon-Veteran, and  \n in the event of the foreclosure where a loss is sustained, the holder must \nabsorb any loss attributable to the non-Veteran’s portion of the loan.  \n \n \n \n \np.

Joint Loans , continued \n \nq. Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act Consideration-s (ECOA) The applicability of the guaranty to only a portion of the loan in the case of a \nVeteran/non-Veteran joint loan may cau se a lender to refuse to accept an \napplication for such loan.  This may appear to conflict with th e ECOA prohibition against discrimination \nbased on marital status; how ever, the lender may refu se the application under \nthese circumstances without violating ECOA.  This is based on an exemption for VA bein\ng a special purpose credit pro gram. \n \nr. Calculation \nof the Funding Fee Apply the appropriate funding fee per centage to any portion of the loan \nallocable to a Veteran using his or her entitlement who is not exempt from the \nfunding fee. Determine the appropriate percentage for the type of Veteran \ninvolved from the funding f ee tables in Chapter 8. \n \nExample.  On a no-downpayment loan to two Veterans; on a first-time \nhomebuyer; and on a subsequent user; the funding fee percentages of 2.15 \npercent and 3.3 percent respectively woul d each be applied to one-half of the \nloan amount. \n \nNo funding fee will be assessed on any por tion of a joint loan  allocable to a: \n \n Non-Veteran \n Veteran who did not use hi s or her entitlement, or \n Veteran who used his or her entitlem ent, but is exempt from the funding \nfee. \n \nDownpayment.  The actual loan amount  is allocated equally between the \nborrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a \ndownpayment is made, and regardless  of where the funds for such a \ndownpayment come from. \n \n Example.  On a Veteran/non-Vetera n loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000 \n(five percent) downpayment out of hi s cash resources, to purchase a $100,000 \nproperty, resulting in a $95,000 loan am ount. The Veteran is a first-time \nhomebuyer.  The Veteran must pa y a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5 \npercent of his/her $47,500 portion.

Construction/Permanent Home Loans \n \nChange Date  March 11, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y  \n \na. The Basics VA will guarantee a “construction/permanent home loan,” that is, a loan to \nfinance the construction/purchase of a resi dence.  The loan is closed prior to \nthe start of construction w ith proceeds disbursed to  cover the cost of, or \nbalance owed on, the land, and the ba lance into escrow.  The escrowed \nmonies are paid out to the builder during construction. \n The lender must obtain written approva l from the borrower before each draw \npayment is provided to the builder.  The loan will not be guaranteed until \nconstruction is complete and all Noti ce of Value (NOV) conditions are met. \n This section does not address other co nstruction loans guaranteed by VA; that \nis, those for the purchase of a residen ce newly constructed for the Veteran by \na builder who financed the construc tion from his or her own resources. \n Lenders should have the specialized experience to originate, process, \nunderwrite (borrower, project, and builde r), close, service and administer such \nloans.  These types of loans and project s inherently have uncertain elements \nthat require careful examination.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 264 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-14 \n 2.

Therefore,  the initial payment on the \nprincipal may be postponed up to 1 year , if necessary.  The loan must be \namortized to achieve full repayment with in its remaining term.  The lender \nmust provide evidence of the amortization in the loan file.  Example.  If it takes 6 months to co mplete construction, the payment schedule \nfor the Veteran obtaining a 30-year mort gage must provide for full repayment \nof the loan in 29 years and 6 months. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 265 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-15 2. Construction/Permanent Home Loans , continued \n \nb. \nAmortization , \ncontinued  Rather than requiring a balloon payment, it may be preferable to set up equal \npayments (beginning after construction is complete) which are large enough \nto repay the loan within the original maturity w ithout a balloon payment. \n The VA requirement that loans be am ortized with approximately equal \npayments and the principal must be reduced at least once annually, also \napplies to construction loan s.  However, the final in stallment may be for an \namount up to five percent of the orig inal principal amount of the loan. \n \n \nc. What the \nBuilder Must Pay? On a construction/permanent home loa n, the builder is responsible for \nInterest payments during the construc tion period, and all fees normally paid \nby a builder who obtains an inter im construction loan including, but not \nlimited to:  \n inspection fees, \n title updates, \n title update fees, \n hazard insurance during construction, and \n property taxes. \n \n \nd. Interest \nRate Lender’s may offer a “ceiling-floor” where the Veteran “floats” the interest \nrate during construction. Th e agreement must provide that at lock-in, the \npermanent interest rate will not exceed a specific maximum interest rate and \npermit the borrower to lock-in at a lowe r rate based on market fluctuations.  \nThe borrower must qualify for the mortgage at the maximum rate. \n \nContinued on next page \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 266 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-16 \n 2.

The Veteran may not     \npay any fees that are the builder’s responsibility.   \n \nf. Funding Fee \nand Loan Reporting The funding fee is due and payable to VA within 15 days of loan closing; that \nis not tied to the commencement or comp letion of construction.  The loan \nmust be guaranteed in WebLGY within  60 days of completion of all NOV \nrequirements.   \n \ng. LGC Although the loan will normally be cons idered guaranteed upon closing, the \nLGC on a construction/permanent home lo an will not be issued until a clear \nfinal compliance inspection repor t has been received by VA.   \n \n \nh. If Loan \nProceeds are Not Fully Disbursed If the construction is not fully comple ted and loan proceeds are not fully \ndisbursed, guaranty will apply only to the proper pro rata part of the loan. To \ncalculate the proper pro ra ta part of the loan: \n \n take loan proceeds disbursed for construction purposes, \n add any other payments made to the bu ilder by or on behalf of the Veteran, \n take the lesser of the above total or 80 percent of the value of that portion of \nthe construction completed, and \n add any loan disbursements made for the purchase of the land on which the \nconstruction is situated.  \n  \n \n\n--- PAGE 267 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-17 3. Energy Efficient Mortgages  \n \nChange Date  March 11, 2019   \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \na. What are \nEEMs? Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) are loans to cover the cost of making \nenergy efficiency improvements to a dwelling.  They can be made in \nconjunction with a: \n \n VA loan for the purchase of an existing dwelling, or \n VA refinancing loan secured by the dwelling. \n \nAcceptable energy efficiency  improvements include, but are not limited to: \n \n solar heating systems, including so lar systems for heating water for \ndomestic use; \n solar heating and cooling systems; \n caulking and weather-stripping; \n furnace efficiency modifications li mited to replacement burners,  \nboilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a reduction in the amount of fuel c onsumed as a result of increased \ncombustion efficiency, devices for modifying flue openings which will \nincrease the efficiency of the heating system, and electrical or mechanical \nfurnace ignition systems which re place standing gas pilot lights; \n  clock thermostats; \n  new or additional ceiling, attic,  wall and floor insulation; \n  water heater insulation; \n  storm windows and/or doors, incl uding thermal windows and/or doors; \n  heat pumps; and \n  vapor barriers.   \n \nb. Borrower \nNotice on the NOV Information on EEMs is provided to a Ve teran who applies for a loan which \nrequires an NOV (a loan for a home purch ase or regular “cash-out” refinance). \nThe NOV includes the followin\ng notice to the Veteran:  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 268 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-18 \n 3.

The mortgage \namount may be increased as a re sult of making energy efficiency \nimprovements such as: Solar or conven tional heating/cooling systems, water \nheaters, insulation, weather-stripping /caulking, and storm windows/doors.  \nOther energy related improvement s may also be considered.” \n The mortgage may be increased by:  \n Up to $3,000 based solely on the documented costs, \n Up to $6,000 provided the increase in monthly mortgage payment \ndoes not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, or \n VA does not permit EEMs more than $6,000 ( 38 U.S.C. §3710(d) ). \n  \n \nc. Underwriting \nConsiderations Energy efficiency improvements up to $3,000: The resulting increase in loan \npayments will normally be offset by a reduction in utility costs. \n Energy efficiency improvements more than $3,000, up to $6,000: The lender must make a determination that the in crease in monthly mortgage payments \ndoes not exceed the likely reduction in m onthly utility costs, and must rely \non locally available information provided by utility companies, municipalities, state agen cies or other reliable sources, and document the \ndetermination.

Guaranty is calculated on an EEM as  described in the following table.  \n \nStep                                                      Action  \n1 Calculate guaranty on the loan without the portion attributable to    \nthe energy efficiency improvements. \n2 Calculate guaranty on the energy efficiency improvements  \nportion by applying the same pe rcentage used in Step 1. \n3 Add the results of Steps 1 and 2 to  arrive at guaranty on the entire  \nloan. \n \nHowever, the Veteran’s entitlement will only be charged the amount arrived \nat in Step 1; it is based upon the loan amount before  adding the cost of the \nenergy efficiency improvements.  Example 1: If a Veteran has full entitlemen t and applies for a loan of \n$80,000, plus $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, VA will guarantee 40 percent of the full loan amount of $86,000. Thus, the dollar amount of \nthe guaranty will be $34,400, even though the charge to the Veteran’s entitlement is only $32,000.  Example 2:  If a Veteran with full entitlem ent applies for a $144,000 loan to \npurchase a home, and adds $6,000 in en ergy efficiency improvements, the \n25 percent guaranty on the loan wi ll only require the use of $36,000 \nentitlement, but th e dollar amount of \nguarant y will be $37,500. \n \nf.

Provide written notification to VA when imp rovements are complete d          \nand the escrow funds are disbursed.  Escrow requirements concerning \ncompletion of improveme nts are listed in Chapter 9 of this handbook.  \n \n Assure the funds are properly app lied to the costs of improvements. \n If, after a reasonable time, the lender determines that the improvements will \nnot be completed:  \n Apply the balance of the escrowed /earmarked funds to reduce the  \n      principal balance on the loan, and \n Provide written notification to  VA that this has been done. \n \nContinued on next page \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 272 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-22 \n 3.

What is a Supplemental Loan \n \nChange Date  March 11, 2019   \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \na. What is a \nSupplemental Loan? A supplemental loan is a loan for the alteration, improvement, or repair of a \nresidential property.  The reside ntial property must secure an existing VA-\nguaranteed loan, and be owned and occ upied by the Veteran, or the Veteran \nwill reoccupy upon completion of major alterations, repairs, or improvements.  The alterations, improvements, or repairs must:  \n      Be for the purpose of substantia lly protecting or improving the basic  \n     livability, or util ity of the property, and \n      Be restricted primarily to the maintenance, replaceme nt, improvement or  \n     acquisition of real property, including fixtures. \n \n   Installation of features such as barbecue pits, swimming pools, etc., does     \n   not meet this requirement. \n No more than 30 percent of the lo an proceeds may be used for the \nmaintenance, replacement, improveme nt, repair, or acquisition of non-\nfixtures or quasi-fixtures such as refrigeration, cooking, washing, and \nheating equipment.  The equipment must  be related to or supplement the \nprincipal alteration for wh ich the loan is proposed. \n \nContinued on next page \n \n    \n \n\n--- PAGE 275 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-25 5.

Required \nLien and Maximum Loan Term It is the lender’s responsibility to obt ain an effective lien of the required \ndignity (lien position). \n \nPossible methods to secure a supplemental loan are: \n \n Through an open-end provision of the instrument securing the existing \nloan, \n Through an amendment of the exis ting loan security instrument, \n By taking a new lien to cover both the existing and the supplemental loans, or \n By taking a separate lien immediately junior to the existing lien. \n The maximum loan term is:  \n 30 years if amortized, or \n 5 years if not amortized.  \n \nc. Other \nRequirements The existing loan must be current with respect to taxes, insurance, and \namortized payments, and must not otherwise be in default unless a primary \npurpose of the supplemental loan is to improve the ability of the borrower to \nmaintain the loan obligation. \n \nThe making of a supplemental loan can ne ver result in any in crease in the rate \nof interest on the existing loan.  A supplemental loan to be written at a hi gher rate of interest  than that payable \non the existing loan must be evidenced by a separate note from the existing \nloan.  \nContinued on next page \n \n\n--- PAGE 276 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-26 \n 5.

Instead, a statement of \nreasonable value may be submitted.  Th e statement must be completed and \nsigned by a VA-designated appraiser.  A VA-designated appraiser is an \nindividual nominated by the lender (who may be an officer, trustee, or \nemployee of the lender or its agent)  who has been approved by the local VA \noffice.    The statement must specify the: \n \n  work done or to be done, \n purchase price or cost of the work and material, and \n purchase price or cost does not exceed the reasonable value. \n \n In lieu of VA compliance inspections, the lender must submit a certification \nas follows:  “The undersigned lender certifies to the Department of Veterans Affairs that \nthe property as repaired, altered, or  improved has been inspected by a \nqualified individual designated by the undersigned, and based on the \ninspection report, the undersigned has dete rmined that the repairs, alterations, \nor improvements financed with the pr oceeds of the loan described in the \nattached VA Form 26-1820 , appear to have been completed in substantial \nconformance with related contracts.”  \n \nf.

Adjustable Rate Mortgages \n \nChange Date  March 11, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \na. General \nInformation Concerning ARMs An ARM loan offers adjustable inte rest rates based on negotiated initial \nfixed interest rates coupled with peri odic adjustments to the interest rate \nover time.  Hybrid ARMs have longer initial fixed rates of 3, 5, 7, or 10 \nyears, while a “traditional” ARM allo ws for an annual adjustment after 1 \nyear. \n \n \nb. Interest \nRate Adjustments Traditional ARMs: Interest rate adjus tments occur on an annual basis.  The \nannual interest rate adjustments ar e limited to a ma ximum increase or \ndecrease of one percentage point.  A dditionally, interest rate increases are \nlimited to a maximum of five percentage  points over the life of the loan. \n \nHybrid ARMs: If the initial contract in terest rate remains fixed for less than \n5 years, the initial adjustment is lim ited to a maximum increase, or decrease \nof one percentage point and the interest rate increase over the life of the loan \nis limited to five percentage points. \n If the initial contract interest rate remains fixed for 5 years or more, the \ninitial adjustment will be limited to a maximum increase or decrease of two \npercentage points and the interest rate in crease over the life of the loan will \nbe limited to six percentage points. \n \n \nc. \nUnderwriting an ARM ARM loans that may adjust after 1 year must be underwritten at one \npercentage point above  the initial rate.  \n Hybrid ARMs with a fixed period of 3 or  more years may be underwritten at \nthe initial interest rate.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 280 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-30 \n 7.

Description As a marketing tool, builders, sellers, or lenders will sometimes establish and \nfund escrows to temporarily reduce a borrower’s loan payments during the \ninitial years of the mortga ge.  The borrower may also fund such an escrow for \nherself/himself as a fina ncial management tool. \n \nVA will guaranty loans involving tempor ary interest rate buydowns, if \notherwise eligible. \n \nA temporary interest rate buydown can  be used in conjunction with any type \nof VA- guaranteed loan. \n \nb. Escrow \nAgreements Funds must be safely escrowed with an  independent third-party escrow agent \nbeyond the reach of prospective creditors of the builder, seller, lender, and the \nborrower. \n \nException.  If the Federal National Mortga ge Association is the holder, it may \ntake custody of the funds. \n \nThe escrow agent must make payments dir ectly to the lender or servicer.  The \nfunds may be used only for payments due on the note.  The funds may not be \nused to pay past due monthly loan pa yments. If the loan is foreclosed or \nprepaid, the funds must be credited against the Veteran’s indebtedness. \n \nEscrowed funds may not revert to the party that esta blished the escrow.  If    \nthe property is sold subject to, or on an assumption of the loan, the escrow   \nmust continue to pa y out on behalf of the new owner. \n \nc. If \nBorrowers Income is Expected to Keep Pace with Payment Increases  The loan application may be underwritten based on the first year’s payment \namount if there are strong indications that the income used to support the \napplication will increase to cover the yearly increases in loan payments. \n \nRoutine cost of living increases cannot be used for this purpose. Increases \nresulting from confirmed future promo tions or wage percentage increases \nguaranteed by labor contracts (for exampl e, teachers, and auto workers) may \nbe given favorable consideration. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 281 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7 Revised \nChapter 7: Loans Requiring Spe cial Underwriting, Guaranty, and Other Considerations \n7-31 7.

If it is \nUnclear Whether the Borrower’s \nIncome Can \nKeep Pace with Increases The loan application must  be underwritten based on the full payment amount \nif there are no strong indications that the income used to support the application can reasonably be expected to  keep pace with the increases in loan \npayments. \n \nThe buydown arrangement can be consider ed a compensating factor.  If the \nresidual income and/or de bt-to-income ratio is marginal, the buydown plan \n(used to offset a short-term debts), along with other compensating factors, \nmay support approval of the loan.  See “Compensating Factors” in Chapter 4 \nof this Handbook. \n \nProvide a statement signed by the unde rwriter giving reasons for approval. \n \nThe terms of the buydown arrangement are not limited to specific criteria \nsuch as a minimum or maximum number of years for application of the assistance payments. \n \nIt is the lender’s respons ibility to review and dete rmine the acceptability of \nthe buydown.

VA Policy on Fees and Charges Paid by the Veteran-\nBorrower \n  \nChange Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 \n• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. \n  \na.  Policy The VA Home Loan program involves a veteran’s benefit.  VA policy has \nevolved around the objective of helping the veteran to use his or her home loan benefit.  Therefore, VA regulations  limit the fees that the veteran can pay \nto obtain a loan.  Lenders must strictly  adhere to the limitations on borrower-paid fees and \ncharges when making VA loans. \n  \nb.  The VA \nFunding Fee In order to defray the cost of admi nistering the VA Home  Loan program, each \nveteran must pay a funding fee to VA at loan closing.   Congress may periodically change the f unding fee rates to reflect changes in \nthe cost of administering the program, or to assist a certain class of veterans. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 289 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-3  \n2.  Fees and Charges the Veteran-Borrower Can Pay \n  \nChange Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 \n• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits.  \n  \na.  VA \nRegulations VA regulations in 38 CFR 36.4312  provide the list of fees and charges that \nthe veteran can pay. \n  \nb.  Overview The veteran can pay a maximum of: \n \n• reasonable and customary amounts for any or all of the “Itemized Fees and \nCharges” designated by VA, plus \n• a one percent flat char ge by the lender, plus \n• reasonable discount points. \n Note :  Some special provisions ap ply to construction, alteration, \nimprovement, and repair loans.   Reference :  See subsection e, “Construction Loans,” in section 2 of this \nchapter. \n  \nc.  Itemized \nFees and Charges The veteran may pay any or all of the following itemized fees and charges in \namounts that are reasonable and customary. \n \nCharge Description \nAppraisal and \nCompliance Inspections • The veteran can pay the f ee of a VA appraiser and VA \ncompliance inspectors. \n• The veteran can also pay for a second appraisal if he \nor she is requesting reco nsideration of value. \n• The veteran cannot  pay for an appraisal requested by \nthe lender or seller for reconsideration of value. \n• The veteran cannot  pay for appraisals requested by \nparties other than th e veteran or lender. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 290 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-4  \n2.

Itemized \nFees and Charges \n(continued)   \n Charge Description \nRecording \nFees  The veteran can pay for record ing fees and recording taxes \nor other charges inci dent to recordation. \nCredit \nReport The veteran can pay for the credit report obtained by the \nlender.  For Automated Underwriting cas es, the veteran may pay the \nevaluation fee of $50 in lieu of the charge for a credit report.    For “Refer” cases, the veteran ma y also pay the charge for a \nmerged credit report, if required.  \nPrepaid Items The veteran can pay that portion of taxes, assessments, and \nsimilar items for the current ye ar chargeable to the borrower \nand the initial deposit for th e tax and insurance account. \nHazard \nInsurance The veteran can pay the required hazard insurance \npremium.  This includes fl ood insurance, if required. \nFlood Zone \nDetermina-tion The veteran can pay the actual amount charged for a \ndetermination of whether a property is in a special flood hazard area, if made by a th ird party who guarantees the \naccuracy of the determination.    The veteran can pay a charge for a life-of-the-loan flood determination service purchased at the time of loan origination.    A fee may not be charged for a flood zone determination \nmade by the lender or a VA appraiser. \nSurvey The veteran can pay a charge  for a survey, if required by the \nlender or veteran.  Any charge for a survey in connection with a condominium loan must  have the prior approval of \nVA. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 291 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-5  \n2.  Fees and Charges the Veteran-Borrower Can Pay, \nContinued \n \nc.  Itemized \nFees and Charges \n(continued)   \n \n Charge Description \nTitle \nExamination and Title Insurance \n The veteran may pay a fee for title examination and title \ninsurance, if any.    If the lender decides that an  environmental protection lien \nendorsement to a title policy is needed, the cost of the \nendorsement may be charged to the veteran. \nSpecial Mailing Fees for Refinancing Loans For refinancing loans only, the veteran can pay charges for \nFederal Express, Express Mail, or a similar service when the saved per diem interest cost to the veteran will exceed the \ncost of the special handling. \nVA Funding Fee Unless exempt, each veteran must pay a funding fee to VA. \nMortgage \nElectronic Registration System (MERS) Fee The veteran may pay a fee for MERS.  MERS is a one-time \nfee for the purpose of electroni cally tracking the ownership \nof the beneficial interest in a loan and its se rvicing rights. \nOther Fees \nAuthorized by VA Additional fees attributable to local variances may be \ncharged to the veteran only if specifically authorized by VA. \nThe lender may submit a written request to the Regional \nLoan Center for approval if th e fee is normally paid by the \nborrower in a particular jurisdiction and considered \nreasonable and customary in the jurisdiction. \n \nWhenever the charge relates to serv ices performed by a third party, the \namount paid by the borrower must be lim ited to the actual charge of that \nthird party.    \nExample :  If the lender obtains a cr edit report at a cost of $30, the \nlender may only charge the borrower $30 for the credit report.  The \nlender may not charge $35, even if it believes that a $5 handling \ncharge is fair. \n\n--- PAGE 292 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-6 2.  Fees and Charges the Veteran-Borrower Can Pay, \nContinued \n  \nc.  Itemized \nFees and \nCharges \n(continued)  In addition, the borrower may not pay a duplicate fee for services that have \nalready been paid for by another party.  Examples :   \n• An appraisal is completed on a prope rty and paid for by a prospective \npurchaser, but the sale is never comp leted.  A second purchaser applies for \na loan before the validity period of the Notice of Value (NOV) expires.  The \nlender uses the same NOV.  The lender may not charge the second \npurchaser an appraisal fee if no second appraisal is ordered.  \n• A survey or flood zone determination, if  the lender elects to use an existing \nsurvey or flood determination. \n  \n  \nd.  Lender’s \nOne Percent \nFlat Charge In addition to the “itemized fees an d charges,” the lender may charge the \nveteran a flat charge not to exceed one percent of the loan amount.   \n Calculate the one percent on the principa l amount after adding the funding fee \nto the loan, if the funding fee is paid fr om loan proceeds (e xcept Interest Rate \nReduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs). \n \nNote :  For IRRRLs, use VA Form 26-8923 , IRRRL Worksheet, for the \ncalculation.   \n The lender’s flat charge is intended to  cover all of the lender’s costs and \nservices which are not reimbursable as “itemized fees and charges.” \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 293 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-7  \n2.

Lender’s \nOne Percent Flat Charge \n(continued)  The following list provides examples of items that cannot be charged to the \nveteran as “itemized fees and charges. ”  Instead, the lender must cover any \ncost of these items out of its flat fee:  \n• lender’s appraisals \n• lender’s inspections, except in construction loan cases \n• loan closing or settlement fees \n• document preparation fees \n• preparing loan papers or conveyancing fees \n• attorney’s services other than for title work \n• photographs \n• interest rate lock-in fees \n• postage and other mailing charges, stationery, telephone calls, and other \noverhead \n• amortization schedules, pass books, and membership or entrance fees \n• escrow fees or charges \n• notary fees \n• commitment fees or marketing fees of any secondary purchaser of the \nmortgage and preparation a nd recording of assignment  of mortgage to such \npurchaser \n• trustee’s fees or charges \n• loan application or processing fees \n• fees for preparation of truth- in-lending disclosure statement \n• fees charged by loan brokers, finders or  other third parties whether affiliated \nwith the lender or not, and \n• tax service fees. \n  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 294 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-8  \n2.  Fees and Charges the Veteran-Borrower Can Pay, \nContinued \n  \ne.  Construction \nLoans The lender can charge an additional flat  charge on constr uction, alteration, \nimprovement, or repair loans.  If the lender supervises th e progress of construction and/or makes advances to \na veteran in excess of 50 percent of the loan duri ng construction, alteration, \nimprovement, or repair, then the lender may charge the veteran up to two percent of the loan amount in addition to the lender’s one percent flat charge.  \n \nExample :  Total charges to the veteran in  these cases would be, at a   \nmaximum, itemized fees and charges plus  a three percent flat charge plus  \ndiscount points. \n \nIf the lender does not supervise the progr ess of construction or make advances \nto a veteran in excess of 50 percent of  the loan during c onstruction, alteration, \nimprovement, or repair, then the lender may charge the veteran up to one percent of the loan amount in addition to  the lender’s one percent flat charge. \n \nExample :  Total charges to the veteran in these cases would be, at a \nmaximum, itemized fees and charges pl us a two percent flat charge plus \ndiscount points. \n This provision also applies to supplemental loans. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 295 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-9  \n3.  Fees and Charges the Veteran-Borrower Cannot Pay \n  \nChange Date November 08, 2010, Change 15 \n• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. \n  \na.  Lender’s \nUse of One Percent Flat Charge The lender’s maximum allowable flat ch arge of one percent of the loan \namount (or greater percentage in the case of construction loans) is intended to \ncover all of the lender’s costs and servi ces which are not reimbursable as \n“itemized fees and charges.”  The lender may pay third parties for services or do as it wishes with the funds from th e flat charge, as long as the lender \ncomplies with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).    Section 2, subsections c and d, of this  chapter provide some examples of \nitems that cannot  be charged to the veteran as “itemized fees and charges.”  \n This section provides more examples of items that cannot be paid by the veteran, but can be paid out of the lende r’s flat charge or by some party other \nthan the veteran. \n  \nb.  Attorney’s \nFees The lender may not charge the borrower for attorney’s fees.  However, \nreasonable fees for title examination wo rk and title insurance can be paid by \nthe borrower.  They are allowabl e itemized fees and charges.  \n VA does not intend to prevent the vete ran from seeking independent legal \nrepresentation.  Therefore, the veteran can independently retain an attorney \nand pay a fee for legal services in co nnection with the purchase of a home.  \nClosing documents should clearly indi cate that the attorney’s fee is not being \ncharged by the lender, but is being pa id by the veteran as part of an \nindependent arrangement with an attorney. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 296 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-10  \n3.  Fees and Charges the Veteran-Borrower Cannot Pay, \nContinued \n  \nc.  Brokerage \nFees Fees or commissions charged by a real estate agent or br oker in connection \nwith a VA loan may not be charged to or paid by  the veteran-purchaser.   \n While use of “buyer” brokers is no t precluded, veteran-purchasers may not, \nunder any circumstances, be charged a brokerage fee or commission in \nconnection with the services of such  individuals.  Since information on \nproperty available for purchase and fina ncing options is widely available to \nthe public from a variety of sources, VA does not believe that preventing the \nveteran from paying buyer-broker fees will harm the veteran. \n  \nd.  Prepayment \nPenalties A veteran obtaining a VA refinancing loan cannot  use loan proceeds to pay \npenalty costs for prepayme nt of an existing lien. \n A veteran purchasing a property with a VA loan cannot  pay penalty costs \nrequired to discharge any existi ng liens on the seller’s property. \n  \ne.  HUD / FHA \nInspection Fees for Builders In proposed construction cases in whic h the dwelling was constructed under \nthe Department of Housing and Urba n Development (HUD) supervision, the \ncost of any inspections or re-inspect ions must be borne by the builder or \nsponsor and are not chargeable to the veteran- purchaser.  This includes: \n \n• re-inspections by VA or HUD of onsite or offsite work for which an escrow \nagreement was established, and \n• any additional re-inspections deemed necessary by VA to assure conformity \nwith VA regulations. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 297 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-11  \n4.  Other Parties Fees and Charges for the Veteran-\nBorrower \n  \nChange Date November 08, 2010, Change 15 \n• This section has been changed to  create subsec tion lettering. \n  \na.  Policy The seller, lender, or any other party may pay fees and charges, including \ndiscount points, on behalf of the borrower.  VA regulations limit charges “made agains t or paid by” the borrower.  They \ndo not limit the payment of fees and charges by other parties. \n  \nb.  Exception Excessive seller conces sions are prohibited. \n Reference :  See section 5 of this chapter. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 298 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-12  \n5. Seller Concessions \n  \nChange Date November 08, 2010, Change 15 \n• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. \n  \na.  Definition For the purposes of this topic, a selle r concession is anything of value added \nto the transaction by the builder or seller for which the buyer pays nothing \nadditional and which the seller is not customarily expected or required to pay \nor provide.   \n  \nb.  Seller \nConcessions Seller concessions include, but are not limited to, the following: \n \n• payment of the buyer’s VA funding fee \n• prepayment of the buyer’s property taxes and insurance \n• gifts such as a television set or microwave oven \n• payment of extra points to provide  permanent interest rate buydowns \n• provision of escrowed funds to provi de temporary interest rate buydowns, \nand \n• payoff of credit balances or judgments on behalf of the buyer. \n Seller concessions do not include payment of the buyer’s closing costs, or \npayment of points as appr opriate to the market. \n Example :  If the market dictates an inte rest rate of 7½ percent with two \ndiscount points, the seller’s payment of the two points would  not be a seller \nconcession.  If the seller paid five poi nts, three of these points would be \nconsidered a seller concession.  \n  \nc.  The Problem In some localities, builders or sellers offer concessions as a competitive tool.  \nIn extreme cases, the concessions may entice unwary and unq ualified veterans \ninto home mortgages they cannot affor d.  The concessions may disguise the \nveteran’s inability to qualify for the loan. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 299 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-13  \n5. Seller Concessions, Continued \n  \nd.  The Four \nPercent Limit Any seller concession or combination of concessions which exceeds four \npercent of the established reasonable value of the property is considered \nexcessive, and unacceptable for VA-guaranteed loans.    Do not include normal discount points and payment of the buyer’s closing \ncosts in total concessions for determining whether concessions exceed the four percent limit. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 300 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-14  \n6.

Itemized \nFees and Charges The borrower’s out-of-pocket expenses for itemized fees and charges already  \nincurred, such as the appr aisal and credit report, do not get refunded. \n  \nb.

This applies to a loan that does not close for \nany reason, including the borrowe r going to another lender. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 301 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-15  \n7.

Note :  Maximum loan amounts are discussed in section 3 of chapter 3.  \n  \nb.  “Cash-out” \nRefinancing Loans For “cash-out” refinancing loans, allo wable fees and charges and discount \npoints (as discussed in section 2 of th is chapter) may be paid from cash \nproceeds of the loan.    Only the VA funding fee (and the cost of any energy efficiency improvements) can be added to increase the loan amount. \n  \nc.  IRRRLs The following fees and charges may be included in an IRRRL: \n \n• Any allowable fees and charges discussed in section 2 of this chapter.  This \nincludes closing costs from the “Itemized Fees and Charges” list, the \nfunding fee, and the lender’s flat charge. \n• However, there is one limitation unique to IRRRLs:  While the borrower \nmay pay any reasonable amount of discount points in  cash,  no more than \ntwo discount points  can be included in the loan amount. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 302 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-16  \n7.

The \nLender’s Role The lender must: \n \n• verify the status of any veteran who may be exempt from paying the \nfunding fee; \n• determine the amount of  funding fee owed by any non-exempt borrower; \n• collect the appropriate fee from all non- exempt borrowers at loan closing; \n• electronically remit the funds to VA in a timely manner through the VA \nFunding Fee Payment System (FFPS);  \n• print proof of payment of the funding fee; and \n• submit proof that the funding fee has been paid or that the veteran is exempt \nfrom paying the funding fee to VA w ith the closed loan package. \n \nNote :  The funding fee may be paid from loan proceeds or cash from \nborrower. \n  \nb.  Who is \nExempt from \nPaying The Funding Fee? The following persons are exempt from paying the funding fee: \n• Veterans receiving VA compensation fo r service-connected disabilities. \n• Veterans who would be entitled to  receive compensation for service-\nconnected disabilities if they did not receive re tirement pay. \n• Veterans who are rated by VA as eligible  to receive compensation as a \nresult of pre-discharge disability exam ination and rating or on the basis of a \npre-discharge review of existing me dical evidence (including service \nmedical and treatment records) that results in issuance of a memorandum \nrating. \n• Veterans entitled to receive compen sation, but who are not presently in \nreceipt because they are on active duty.  \n• Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-\nconnected disabilities (whether or not  such surviving spouses are veterans \nwith their own entitlement and whethe r or not they ar e using their own \nentitlement on the loan). \n\n--- PAGE 304 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-18  \n8.  The VA Funding Fee, Continued \n  \nc.  How to \nVerify Exempt Status The lender must verify exempt stat us by obtaining one of the following: \n \n• a properly completed and signed VA Form 26-8937 , Verification of VA \nBenefits, indicating the borrower’s exempt status, \n• for a veteran who elected servic e retirement pay instead of VA \ncompensation, a copy of the original VA notification of disability rating and \ndocumentation of the veteran’s service retirement income, or  \n• indications on the Certifi cate of Eligibility (COE) that the borrower is \nentitled as an unmarried surviving spouse. \n Consult VA if the borrower’s status is unclear after reviewing the appropriate \ndocuments, or if conflicting information is found. \n  \nd.  Loan \nSubmissions Involving Exempt Borrowers Submit a copy of the documentation used to verify exempt status with the \nclosing package.    Exception :  The lender does not have to submit the documentation if the \nborrower is an eligible surviving sp ouse, or the documentation had been \npreviously provided to VA with the loan  application as verification of the \nveteran’s income. \n \nNote :  A lender who believes that a servicemember may be exempt from \npayment of the funding fee based on a pr e-discharge exam should contact the \nVA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of juri sdiction for assistance confirming the \nexempt status. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 305 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-19 8.

If Exempt \nStatus Cannot \nBe Determined If the veteran’s exempt status cannot be  verified prior to loan closing, the \nfunding fee must  be remitted as if the borrower was not exempt.   \n Indicate in the closing package that the veteran claims exempt status.  VA \nwill determine the borrower’s status and refund the funding fee if appropriate.  \n If the veteran has a pending disability compensation claim at the time of loan \nclosing, the funding fee must be re mitted as if the borrower was not exempt. \n Advise the veteran to contact the VA RL C to request a refund if it is later \ndetermined that the veteran is entitled to compensation retroactively to a date prior to loan closing.  \n \nReference :  Refer to subsection j, “Refunding Overpayments to the Veteran,” \nin this section. \n  \nf.  How to \nCalculate the \nFunding Fee For all loans except IRRRLs, apply th e appropriate percentage (from the \nfunding fee tables) to the loan amount.    If the funding fee is to be paid from lo an proceeds, apply the percentage to the \nloan amount without the funding fee amount added to it.   \n \nFor IRRRLs, calculate th e funding fee by completing VA Form 26-8923 , \nIRRRL Worksheet. \n Reference :  For joint loans, see “Calculati on of the Funding Fee” in section 1 \nof chapter 7 . \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 306 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges and the VA Funding Fee \n8-20  \n8.  The VA Funding Fee, Continued \n  \ng.  How to Use \nthe Funding Fee Tables The lender must find the appropriate pe rcentage in the tables using the \nfollowing parameters:  \n• Is the veteran eligible for VA loan benefits through service in the regular \nmilitary or the Reserves/National Guard?  Examine the COE.  For \nReserves/National Guard, the COE bears the notation, \n“RESERVES/NATIONAL GUARD - INCREASED FUNDING FEE,” and \nis buff-colored rather than green. \n• Is the veteran a subsequent user of VA home loan benefits or obtaining his \nor her first VA loan?  Examine the CO E.  An entitlement code of “5” \nindicates subsequent use, as does a loan number entered in the “Loan \nNumber” column.  \n• What type of loan is the vetera n obtaining?  The funding fee varies \ndepending upon whether the loan is a purchase or construction loan, an \nIRRRL, or a cash-out refinancing loan. \n• Is the veteran making a downpayment of at least five or ten percent? \n− Calculate what percentage of the sale s price of the property the veteran is \nremitting as a downpayment. \n− The downpayment may come from th e veteran’s own resources or \nborrowed funds.  Except,  if the purchase price exceeds the reasonable \nvalue of the property, the difference between the purchase price and the \nreasonable value must be paid by the veteran in cash without borrowing. \n• For construction loans only, equity in the secured property counts as a \ndownpayment for calculating the funding fee. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 307 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 8: Borrower Fees and Charges \nand the VA Funding Fe e  \n8-21 8.

How and \nWhen to Remit the Funding Fee to VA Lenders must remit the VA funding fee via the VA FFPS ; within 15 calendar \ndays of loan closing.   \n Lenders paying the fee more than 15 days after loan closing will automatically be assessed a four percen t late fee.  Fees paid more than 30 \ndays late will automatically be assessed an interest charge in addition to the late fee. \n  \nj.  Refunding \nOverpayments to the Veteran A refund is appropriate if: \n \n• an exempt veteran paid a funding fee, or \n• a miscalculation of the fee caused an overpayment. \n Using the VA FFPS , lenders can make appropriate corrections that may result \nin refunds being due.   \n If the veteran was overcharg ed, the following applies: \n \n• A veteran who paid cash for the fundi ng fee receives a cash refund for the \namount of the overpayment. \n• In the case of a veteran who paid th e funding fee out of loan proceeds, the \nlender must apply the overpayment ag ainst the loan balance.  Submit \nevidence to VA that the refund was applie d to the loan’s principal balance. \n  \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 309 ---\nChapter 9 Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and                      \nRelated Issues \nOverview \n  \nIn this Chapter This chapter contains  the following topics. \n \nTopic Topic See \nPage \n1 Securit y Instruments 9-2 \n2 Escape Clause and Notice of Value (NOV) 9-4 \n3 Title Limitations 9-5 \n4 Land Sale Contracts and Option Contracts    9-8 \n5 Secondar y Borrowin g 9-9 \n6 Purchase of Propert y with Encumbrances 9-11 \n7 Liens Coverin g Communit y-Type Services and Facilities 9-12 \n8 Powe r of Attorne y (POA) 9-14 \n9 Lender Review of Sales Contracts on Proposed \nConstruction 9-17 \n10 Escrow for Proposed Comp letion of Improvements 9-19 \n11 Hazard Insurance 9-22 \n12 Escrow for Taxes and Insurance 9-25 \n13 Homebu yer Assistance Pro gram (HAP) 9-26 \n \n  \n\n--- PAGE 310 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-2 1.  Security Instruments  \n   \nChange Date July 30, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. \nRequirements Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not have a specific note or \nmortgage form that lenders must  use for VA-guaranteed loans. VA \nregulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4337  provide that security  instruments used by a \nlender which are inconsistent with VA regulations in effect on the date the \nloan is closed will be considered am ended and supplemented to conform to \nthe regulations.  \nLenders must ensure that the se curity instruments they use: \n \n establish the required lien \n comply with the laws and regul ations governing VA’s home loan \nprogram \n comply with applicable state laws, and \n contain the following VA clauses: \no assumption approval clause, \no acceleration clause, \no funding fee clause, \no processing charge clause, and \no indemnity liability assumption clause.  \n \n   \nb. Assumption \nApproval \nClause The instruments evidencing the loan must read substantially as follows: \n “THIS LOAN IS NOT ASSUMAB LE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF \nTHE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR ITS AUTHORIZED \nAGENT.”  The loan assumption notice must appear conspicuously on at least one of the securit\ny instruments for the loan. \n Continued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 311 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-3 \n 1.  Security Instruments, continued \n  \nc. Other \nClauses The mortgage or deed of trust must c ontain four additional clauses related to \nthe assumption of the loan.  VA does not specifically require that these \nclauses also be included in the note, unl ess this is required under state law to \nmake them enforceable. Due to varia tions in local laws, the lender should \nobtain legal guidance as to any minor ch anges in these sample clauses which \nmay be necessary to ensure that they have the effect required by the law and \nregulations; that is, th e lender does not have to  use the exact language \nprovided for these four clauses.  \nAcceleration Clause \nThis loan may be declared immediately  due and payable upon transfer of the \nproperty securing such loan to any tran sferee, unless the acceptability of the \nassumption of the loan is established pursuant to 38 U.SC. 3714 . \n \nFunding Fee Clause \nA fee equal to one-half of one percent of th e balance of this loan as of the date \nof transfer of the property shall be paya ble at the time of transfer to the loan \nholder or its authorized agent, as trust ee for the VA. If the assumer fails to pay \nthis fee at the time of transf er, the fee shall constitute an additional debt to that \nalready secured by this instrument, sha ll bear interest at the rate herein \nprovided, and at the option of the payee of the indebtedness hereby secured or \nany transferee thereof, shall be immedia tely due and payable.  This fee is \nautomatically waived if the assumer is exempt under the provisions of 38 \nU.S.C. 3729(c) . \n \nProcessing Charge Clause   \nUpon application for approva l to allow assumption of this loan, a processing \nfee may be charged by the loan holder or  its authorized agent for determining \nthe creditworthiness of the assumer a nd subsequently revising the holder’s \nownership records when an approved tr ansfer is completed. The amount of \nthis charge shall not exceed the maximum established by VA for a loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714  applies. \n Indemnity Liability Assumption Clause \nIf this obligation is assumed, then the assumer hereby agrees to assume all of \nthe obligations of the Veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and \nsecuring the loan. The assumer further ag rees to indemnify VA to the extent \nof any claim payment arising from the guaranty or insurance of the \nindebtedness created by this instrument. \n \n\n--- PAGE 312 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-4 2. Escape Clause and No tice of Value (NOV)  \n \nChange Date July 30, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. Sales \nContract The Escape Clause must be containe d in the sales contract for all VA-\nguaranteed loans.   The lender is respons ible for ensuring that the paragraph is \nin the sales contract prior to  closing.  In the event the clause is not in the sales \ncontract, VA ma y not guarant y the loan. \n \nb. Builders and \nRealtors The builders/realtors that initiate contracts on new construction must ensure \nthat the Escape Clause is in the cont ract and the contract is signed by the \nVeteran and seller. \n \nc. Upgrades Upgrades are not considered earnest m oney and the builder is not required to \nrefund this money.  When the NOV is be low the sales contra ct price, this \nclause protects the Veteran with ne gotiation of the sales contract. \n \nd. Escape \nClause If the sales contract was signed by the Veteran prior to receipt of the NOV, \nthe contract must include, or be am ended to include, the clause below. \n “It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any ot her provisions of this \ncontract, the purchaser shall not incu r any penalty by forfeiture of earnest \nmoney or otherwise or be obligated to complete the purchase of the property \ndescribed herein, if the c ontract purchase price or cost exceeds the reasonable \nvalue of the property established by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \npurchaser shall, however, have the priv ilege and option of proceeding with the \nconsummation of this contract without re gard to the amount of the reasonable \nvalue established by the Depar tment of Veterans Affairs ( 38 U.S.C. 501, \n3703(c)(1) ).”   \n \nThis clause may be found at 38 C.F.R. 36.4303(k)(4)  in its entirety. \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- PAGE 313 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-5 \n 3.  Title Limitations \n  \nChange Date July 30, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. Estate of the \nVeteran in the \nProperty VA regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4354  provide the parameters  for the required \nestate of a Veteran in real pr operty securing a VA-guaranteed loan. \n \nThe lender is responsible for ensuring th e loan conforms to these parameters.  \nFor IRRRLs (see Chapter 6, Topic 6, Item k of this handbook). \n \nA beneficial interest in a revocable Fa mily Living Trust that ensures that the \nVeteran, or Veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the \nlien attaches to any remainder interest and the tr ust arrangement is valid under \nstate law. \n  \nb. Estate Title  Generally, title to the estate shall be  that which is acceptable to informed \nbuyers, title companies, and attorneys in the community in which the \npropert y is situated. \n  \nc. Mortgage \nNote or Deed  VA does not allow an individual to take title  to a property if th at individual is  \nnot on either the mortgage note or a mortga ge deed of trust.  Accordingly, if  \na spouse or other owner does not want to sign a mortgage note and be  \nobligated for a VA-guaranteed home lo an that individual must sign a  \nmort gage deed of trust. \n  \nd.  Title \nInsurance VA does not require a lender making a VA loan or the Veteran-borrower to  \nobtain title insurance.  The lende r may apply its own title insurance \nrequirements to VA loan transactions.  VA requires only that title to the  \nproperty meet the standards described above in “Estate of the Veteran in the \nPropert y.” \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 314 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-6 3. Title Limitations,  continued \n \ne. Restrictions \non the Purchase \nor Resale of \nProperties Restrictions on the purchase or resale of the property ar e unacceptable to \nVA, with certain exceptions.  The lender must:  \n ensure any restrictions fall with in the exceptions provided by VA \nregulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4308  and 38 C.F.R. 36.4354 ; \n consult VA where doubt exists; \n obtain VA approval where required; and \n fully inform the Veteran and obt ain his or her consent to the \nrestrictions in writing at th e time of loan application. \n \n \nf. Examples of \nRestrictions that Require VA \nApproval A lender may not accelerate a loan base d on the sale of the secured property \nunless the acceptability of the assu mption of the loan has not been \nestablished pursuant to Section 38 U.S.C. 3714 , except \nthat:  \n Under 38 C.F.R. 36.4309(b), VA may guarantee a loan made through \na state, territorial, or local governme nt program where restrictions in \nthe legal instruments require acceleration of the loan if it is assumed \nby a party ineligible for a ssistance under the program. \n Such acceleration must be mandated by federal, state, territorial, or \nlocal law or regulation. \n VA may guarantee a loan made  through a state or lo cal government program, \ndesigned to assist low-or moderate -income individuals, which imposes \nresale and price restrictions on purchas ers.  Under such a program, if the \nproperty is resold within a period es tablished by local law or ordinance, \ncertain restrictions as set forth in 38 C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5)(iv)(A)  on to whom \nthe property may be sold, the resale pri ce, and other restrictions approved by \nthe Secretary may be applied.  \nVA may guarantee a loan on which a title re striction limits the sale, lease, or \noccupancy of the dwelling to persons based on age, incl uding a prohibition \nagainst the permanent occupancy of the dwelling by children, provided such \nrestriction complies with applicable federal law ( 38 U.S.C. 3704(c) ).   \n \nVA may refuse to approve a property with  an age restricti on if its operation \nwould create an undue hardship upon th e owner in the case of sudden, \nunforeseen events or be likely to result in an increased risk  of loan default. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 315 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-7 \n 3.  Title Limitations,  continued \n   \ng. Examples of \nRestrictions That Do Not \nRequire VA \nApproval Title to property involving reasonable encroachments, easements, servitudes, \nand reservations for water, timber, or  subsurface rights, generally do not \nrequire VA approval.  However, they mu st be taken into consideration in \ndetermining reasonable value.    If any of these restrictions impact the basic livability of the property (meeting \nminimum propert\ny standards), VA approval is required. \n  \nh. Effect of \nTitle \nLimitations on Reasonable \nValue Title conditions or limi tations must be shown on the NOV and considered by \nthe appraiser in determining the reasona ble value of the property.  If the \nlender discovers, prior to loan closin g, title conditions or limitations not \nshown on the NOV, the lender must ha ve VA review the conditions and \ndetermine whether the value assigned to the property is materially affected.  Without such a determination by VA, th e lender risks a later finding that the \ncondition or limitation affects the reasona ble value of the property to the \nextent that: \n \n the loan will be ineligible for guaranty, or \n a claim on the guaranty will be subject to reduction under 38 C.F.R. \n36.4325 . \n   \n\n--- PAGE 316 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-8 4. Land Sale Contract s and Option Contracts \n  \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. Eligibility of \nLand Sale Contracts VA may guarantee an obligation secured by a land sale contract for the \npurchase of improved residential prop erty in the same manner as any \nobligation secured by a mortga ge or deed of trust.  \n \n The land sale contract must contai n the mandatory clauses provided in \nTopic 1 of this chapter. \n The contract must be recorded. \n \n  \nb. Refinance \nLand Sale \nContracts Pursuant to Title 38 of the U.S.C., subchapter 3710(b)(7)(B) , VA may also \nguarantee a loan to refinance the unpaid balance under a land sale contract for \nthe purchase of improved resi dential property, provided: \n \n the Veteran will obtain title to the pr operty described in the contract \nupon closing of the loan, and \n the obligation to be guaranteed is in the form of a mortgage note or \nbond secured by a mortgage or other acceptable form of security instrument other than the existin\ng land sale contract. \n \nc. Eligibility of \nOption \nContracts Option contracts are not eligible for guaranty; however, VA may guarantee a \nloan made for the unpaid purchase pri ce of residential property when the \noption is exercised. \n   \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 317 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-9 \n 5.  Secondary Borrowing \n    \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. What is \nSecondary \nBorrowing  For purposes of this topic, secondary  borrowing refers to the Veteran  \nobtaining a second mortgage simultane ously with a VA-guaranteed first \nmortgage, both secured by the same property.  This does not include HAPs \n(see Topic 9, Item 13 of this chapter). \n     \nb. Policy Secondary borrowing is acceptable as long as: \n \n the Veteran is not placed in a subs tantially worse position than if the \nentire amount borrowed had been guaranteed by VA, \n the loan (in conjunction with the fi rst mortgage) may not exceed the \nNOV, and \n the requirements detailed below are met. \n \nc.  \nRequirements The second mortgage must meet  the following requirements: \n \nFactor  Requirement  \nDocumentation The lender must submit documentation disclosing the \nsource, amount, and repayment terms of the second mortgage and agreement to such terms by the Veteran and any co-borrowers. \nLien Position The second mortgage must be subordinated to the \nVA-guaranteed loan, that is, the second mortgage must be in a junior lien position relative to the VA \nloan. \nAllowable \nPurposes Proceeds of the second mortgage may be used for a \nvariety of purposes, in cluding, but not limited to: \n closing costs, or \n a downpayment to meet secondary market \nrequirement of the lender. \nBut may not be used to cover any portion of a \ndownpayment required by VA to cover the excess of the purchase price over VA’s reasonable value. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 318 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-10 5.  Secondary Borrowing, continued  \n   \nc. \nRequirements, \ncontinued  Factor  Requirement  \nCash back There can be no cash back to the Veteran from the \nVA first mortgage or a sec ond mortgage obtained    \nsimultaneously, except any cash the Veteran paid \nin the transaction. \nUnderwriting The Veteran must qualify for the second mortgage \nwhich is underwritten as an additional recurring \nmonthl y obligation.  \nInterest \nRate The rate on the second mortgage may exceed the \nrate on the VA-guaranteed first; however, it may not exceed industry standards for second mortgages. \nAssumability The second mortgage s hould not restrict the \nVeteran’s ability to sell the property any more than the VA first mortgage. Th at is, it should be \nassumable by creditworthy purchaser(s). \nGrace Period There should be a r easonable grace period before. A \nlate charge comes due, or commencement of \nforeclosure proceedings in the event of default. \n \n     \nd. Unusual \nTerms Second mortgages bearing unusual terms, interest rates, et c., are sometimes \noffered by parties such as: \n \n federal, state, or loca l government agencies, \n non-profit organizations, \n private individual, \n builders, or \n sellers. \n  \ne. VA \nStandards Consult a VA RLC with jurisdiction ove r the state where the property is \nlocated if it is unclear whether the terms of the second mortgage meet VA \nstandards or if there may be a reason able basis for VA to make an exception \nto the standards detailed in this topic. \n     \n\n--- PAGE 319 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-11 \n 6.  Purchase of Property with Encumbrances \n  \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n  \na. Policy \n Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3703(d)(3)(A) , a VA-guaranteed loan must be \nsecured by a first lien on the realty.  Lenders are responsible for properly \nsecuring the first-lien position of a VA- guaranteed loan.  Any existing liens \non the propert y must be paid off or s ubordinated to the VA loan. \n  \nb. Eligibility A loan to purchase property subject to unpaid delinquent taxes, special \nassessments, prior mortgage indebted ness, or other obligations secured by \neffective liens that the Veteran ag rees to pay or which constitute \nencumbrances on the property is not elig ible for guaranty, if  the loan amount, \nplus these unpaid obli gations, exceeds VA’s reasonable value of the propert y. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 320 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-12 7.  Liens Covering Community-T ype Services and Facilities  \n \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. Policy Loans for the purchase and construction of homes will be first liens, subject \nonly to taxes, special assessments, and ground rents.  VA will not approve superior liens in favor of private entities unless they: \n \n are legally or practically necessary, and \n result in no prejudice to the Veterans or the Government. \n  \nb. \nRequirements The lender must obtain VA prior approva l of liens held by private parties \nwhich are superior to VA home mortga ge liens.  Liens held by mandatory \nmembership home associations in planned unit developments are not addressed in this topic.  The lender must demonstrate that: \n \n it is not legal or practical to subor dinate the superior lien to the VA \nmortgage, \n there is a viable rati onale for not subordinat ing the superior lien, \n the superior lien will not prejudice Veterans or  the Government, and \n if periodic charges or assessmen ts are involved, the amounts are \nreasonable and limits on the amoun ts have been established. \n \n  \nc. VA Approval Always obtain VA approval before th e lien is recorded. Builders and \ndevelopers should be aware that if they  plan to market properties through VA \nfinancing, covenants creating superior lie ns should not be recorded without  \nVA approval. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 321 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-13 \n 7.  Liens Covering Community-T ype Services and Facilities, \ncontinued \n  \nd. Examples  VA may find the following types of superior liens acceptable ( 38 C.F.R. \n36.4356):  \n \n Liens for taxes, assessme nts, and ground rents. \n Liens by private entities to secu re assessments or charges for \nmunicipal- type services  and facilities which: \no are clearly governmental in nature, and  \no a municipality could support out of public tax revenue if it \nprovided the service, but the municipality does not provide them. \n Liens to implement or augment a service or facility if the \ngovernment’s provision of such serv ice or facility is inadequate. \n Liens for services or facilities in  locations where the services or \nfacilities are adequately supplied by local government generally will \nnot be approved by VA. \n Liens created by recorded covenants in favor of private entities to \nsecure the homeowner’s share of  the costs of the management, \noperation, maintenance, services, or  programs for th e benefit of a \ndevelopment. \n Liens (on existing properties) pr eviously retained by trustees, \nimprovement associations or ot her nongovernmental  entities for \ncommunity-type services and facilities  in a given area or subdivision, \nsuch as maintenance of streets, parkways, playgrounds, water systems, \nsewa\nge systems, police and fire protection, or street li ghting. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 322 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-14 8.  Power of Attorney (POA) \n   \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. Policy VA will allow a Veteran to use an attorney-in-fact to execute any documents \nnecessary to obtain a VA-guaranteed loan.  This enables active duty servicepersons stationed overseas, and other Veterans  who cannot be present \nto execute loan documents, to obtain VA loans. \n \nb. \nRequirements The Veteran must execute a general or specific POA which is valid and \nlegally adequate.  The Veteran’s attorney-in-fact (as specified in the POA) must use this POA to apply for a Certif icate of Eligibility (COE) and initiate \nprocessing of a loan on behalf of the Ve teran.  A military POA is considered a \ngeneral POA and is only valid durin g the Active Duty Servicemembers’ \n(ADSM) period of deployme nt, not to exceed 1 year. \n To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, ensure that the general or specific POA complies with state law to the extent that: \n \n the mortgage can be legally enforced in that jurisdiction, and \n clear title can be conveyed in  the event of foreclosure. \n \nTo complete the loan transaction usi ng an attorney-in-fact, VA also requires \nthe Veteran’s written consen t to the specifics of the transaction either through \na general POA or a specific POA. \n \nGeneral POA - The Veteran’s signature  on both the sales contract and the \nUniform Residential Loan Application, as  long as the Veteran’s intention to \nobtain a VA loan on the particular prope rty is expressed somewhere in those \ndocuments.  \nContinued on next page \n \n\n--- PAGE 323 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-15 \n 8.

Procedures Prior to requesting an ap praisal of proposed cons truction, the lender must \nreview the sales contract or purchase agreement on the property.  The lender \nmust determine whether the contract:  \n is acceptable, and \n \ndoes not contain unfair contractual provisions.  \n   \nb. Revisions The lender must request revisions of an unacceptable contract by the parties \nto the transaction.  The lender should report unacceptable contract practices \nby a VA program participant (s uch as a builder) to VA if: \n \n the program participant is engage d in practices which seriously \nprejudice the interests of Vete rans or the Government, or \n the program participant repeatedly  uses unacceptable contracts or \ncontracts containing unfair co ntractual provisions, and is \nuncooperative in chan ging such practices  \n  \nc. Closing The closing of the loan indicates that th e lender has determined the contract is \nacceptable.  \n  \nd. Examples of \nUnfair \nContract \nProvisions or Features Example  Unfair Contract Provisions or Features  \n1 Provisions allowing the downpayment or earnest money of the \npurchaser to be forfeited or retained as liquidated damages if the purchaser cannot obtain VA financing. \n2 Inclusion in a lump-sum  contract of an “escalator clause” which \nobligates the purchaser to pay a higher price in the event of \nincreased costs for labor, material, or other items prior to delivery \nof title unless accompanied by a proviso which gives the purchaser the option of canceli ng the contract and obtaining a \nrefund of the moneys paid, if th e increased price is not acceptable \nto the buyer/Veteran.  \n \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 326 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-18 9.

Escrow for Postponed Co mpletion of Improvements \n   \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. General In some instances, it may not be possibl e to complete certain items before the \nVeteran wishes to move into the propert y.  The escrow of funds can permit the \nVeteran-purchaser to gain occupancy of  the dwelling prior to completion of \ncertain items which must be postponed due to weather conditions or other \ncircumstances.  Such items include, but are not limited to:  \n walkways, driveways, and retaining walls, \n exterior painting, \n landscaping, and \n garages. \n   \nb. Escrow of \nFunds to \nComplete Unfinished \nWork VA may permit the escrow of funds n ecessary to complete the unfinished \nwork later, and still issue evidence of guaranty.  An escrow involves the \nfollowing: \n \n withholding 1 1/2 times the dollar am ount necessary to complete the \npostponed items (as estimated by a th ird party) from the proceeds due \nthe seller at closing, \n holding the escrowing funds in a proper, secure manner, and \n releasing the funds once the postponed items have been satisfactorily \ncompleted. \n  \nc. Establishing \nan Escrow \nFund To establish an escrow, the following must apply: \n \n construction of the dwelling must be  complete and the house must be \nsuitable for immedi ate occupancy, \n postponement of the improvements mu st be beyond the control of the \nbuilder/seller, \n the duration of the postp onement must not be un reasonable (usually 90 \nto 120 days), and \n the amount escrowed must be at leas t 1 1/2 times an estimate of the \namount needed to complete the work. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 328 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-20 10.

Establishing \nan Escrow \nFund,  \ncontinued  \n Lenders are not required to escrow funds when: \n \n the incomplete work is limited to the installation of landscaping \nfeatures due to inclement weat her (lawns, shrubbery, etc.), \n the estimate of the cost to comple te the work is not greater than \n$2,500, and \n there is adequate assurance that th e work will be completed timely and \nsatisfactoril y (usuall y 90 to 120 da ys). \n  \nd. General \nProcedures No prior approval of VA is required  to escrow funds.  Lenders are \nresponsible for establishing escrows in accordance with the guidelines \npresented in this topic.  Lenders are also responsible fo r assuring that the \npostponed work is completed.

Hazard Insurance \n  \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. General \nRequirements The lender is responsible for ensuring th at hazard insurance is obtained prior \nto loan closing, and maintained for the te rm of the loan.  It must be of an \ninsurance type or types and in an am ount sufficient to protect the property \nagainst risks or hazards to which it may be subjected in the locality.  Generally, the type(s) and amount of in surance coverage customary in the \nlocality will satisfy this requirement.  Policies must provide that all amounts \npayable, including unearned pr emiums, shall be payable to the holder, or to a \ntrustee or other person for the holder.   All policy paymen ts received for \ninsured losses must be applied to the rest oration of the security or to the loan \nbalance. \n \nb. Flood \nInsurance \nRequirements The lender is responsible for ensuring  that flood insurance is obtained and \nmaintained on any building or personal property that secure s a VA loan if the \nproperty is located in a special flood hazard area (SFHA), as identified by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The following flood insurance considerations may apply:  \n The lender/holder’s responsibility ex tends through the entire term of \nthe loan, and includes insuring any secured property that becomes \nnewly located in a SFHA due to FEMA remapping. \n \n The VA appraiser’s opinion on whethe r the property is located in a \nSFHA does not relieve the lender from responsibility  for ensuring \nflood insurance coverage on a property which is in fact located in a \nSFHA.  \n Personal property requiring covera ge can include a manufactured \nhome and its appliances, carpet, et c. if they secure the loan. \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 331 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-23 \n 11.  Hazard Insurance , continued \n  \nb. Flood \nInsurance \nRequirements, \ncontinued   The amount of flood insurance must be equal to th e lesser of the \noutstanding principal balance of th e loan or the maximum limit of \ncoverage available for the partic ular type(s) of property under the \nNational Flood Insurance Act.  \n Contact local property insurance agen ts or brokers, or FEMA regional \noffices, for current informati on on maximum available coverage. \n \nNote:  VA cannot guarantee a loan if the security is located in a SFHA and \nflood insurance is not available.  \n  \nc. \nConsequences \nof Uninsured \nLosses VA may reduce a future guaranty cla im based on the lender’s noncompliance \nwith VA hazard/flood insurance require ments which results in uninsured \nlosses (unless a waiver has been gran ted).  The lender must determine the \nminimum insurance coverage needed  to meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \n36.4329  for a specific loan.  If the required amount of coverage is maintained, \nno future guaranty claim can be reduced due to inadequate coverage provided there has been no change in the nature, value, or use of the security that \nwould require new or additional coverage  (based on what is customary in the \nlocality) since VA’s determination was made.  \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 332 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9: Legal Instruments, Li ens, Escrows, and Related Issues \n9-24 11.  Hazard Insurance , continued \n  \nd. Special \nConsiderations \nwith \nHomeowners Associations\n Condominiums and many townhouse homeowners associations (HOAs) \nmaintain blanket or master polic ies on common areas, including common \nmechanical and structural elements.  The limits of coverage should be \ndescribed in the policy, and may also be referred to in the organizational \ndocuments.  Lenders should be aware that policies maintained by some HOAs \nmay not provide adequate coverage.    Condominium HOAs may protect only the shel l of the structure. These “studs \nout” policies do not cover: \n \n interior walls, \n flooring, \n plumbing or electrical fixtures, \n cabinets, \n heating, ventilation, and air c onditioning (HVAC) equipment, \n appliances, and \n other items considered part  of the real property. \n \nCarefully review the terms of each blanket policy, or confirm with the HOA \nthat adequate coverage is in effect (and check periodically for any changes in \ncoverage).  If coverage is inadequate , the homeowner can be held responsible \nthrough the terms of the loan instrume nts, for maintaining coverage on the \nportions of the real propert\ny not covered b y the master polic y. \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 333 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-25 \n 12.

Homebuyer Assistance Program (HAP) \n   \nChange Date July 30, 2019 \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n   \na. General \nInformation VA permits Veteran purchasers to utiliz e HAP services when obtaining a VA \nhome loan. Both government and pr ivate entities administer HAPs. \n \n Lenders are not required to obtain VA approval of such programs \nbefore closing the loan.  Home buyer assistance programs that are \nadministered by a state, county, or municipal government entity have \nblanket approval for use with VA loans.  These state and local programs are not to be confused with the Department of Defense HAP. \n HAPs that do not fall under the blanket approval, should forward the \ndocumentation to the VA RLC with  jurisdiction over property state.   \n    \nb. \nRequirements Lenders making VA loans involving HAPs must ensure the following: \n \n the borrower(s) meet(s) VA credit standards,  \n the lender obtains a VA appraisal, and  \n the property must meet VA minimum property standards. \n \nIf the sale price of the property ex ceeds the VA reasonable value of the \nproperty, VA will only allow HAP assistan ce in the form of a grant to pay \nthe difference.  Otherwise the Vetera n must pay the difference of price \nover value from his or her own funds without borrowing. \n \nHAPs often require buyers to occupy th e property for a specified period of \ntime.  The lender must, at closing, obtain the borrower’s acknowledgement of this requirement , and provide a copy of the signed \nacknowled\ngement if VA requests the loan file for review.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 335 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 9:  Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and Related Issues  \n \n9-27 \n 13.

HAP Fees Chapter 8 of this handbook lists closing charges that Veteran-borrowers are not \nallowed to pay when a one-percent loan origination fee is charged.  Since HAPs \nare designed to assist low to moderate income buyers, lend ers may not charge \nVeteran-borrowers unallowabl e fees and use HAP funds to offset these charges \nsince this practice dilutes the assistance that the HAP was intended to provide. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 336 ---\nChapter 10 Appraisal Process \nOverview \n \nIn this \nChapter This chapter contains  the following topics. \n \nTopic Topic Name See \n Page \n1 Appraisal Process Summar y 10-3 \n2 Orderin g an Appraisal 10-4 \n3 Sales Contract 10-6 \n4 Duplicate Appraisal Requests 10-8 \n5 Cancelin g Appraisal Requests 10-9 \n6 Customer Service Expectations 10-10 \n7 Appraisal Timeliness 10-12 \n8 Market Data Submitted Durin g the Appraisal Process 10-13 \n9 Properties Eli gible fo r an Appraisal 10-15 \n10 Properties Not Eligible for an Appraisal 10-19 \n11 Builder Identification Numbers 10-21 \n12 Proposed Construction A ppraisal from Plans and \nSpecifications 10-22 \n13 Proposed Construction Apprai sal from a Model Home 10-23 \n14 Construction Inspections 10-25 \n15 Warranty Requirements for New Construction 10-26 \n16 Warranty Requirements for Proposed Construction 10-27 \n17 Post Construction Inspec tion by an Appraiser 10-28 \n18 Veteran Building His/Her Own Home 10-29 \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 337 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 10: Appraisal Process \n10-2 Overview , continued \n  \nIn this \nChapter , \ncontinued   \nTopic Topic Name See \nPage \n19 Special Exception for a Veteran Purchasing a New \nConstruction Propert y without a Warrant y 10-30 \n20 New Construction Sold b y the Lende r 10-31  \n21 Completed Appraisal Uploaded to WebLGY 10-32  \n22 Reconsideration of Value 10-33  \n23 Repair Inspections 10-34  \n24 Appraisal and Repair Inspection Fees 10-36  \n25 Appraisal Fee Collection Issues 10-38  \n26 Request from the Veteran to Chan ge Lenders 10-39  \n27 Natural Disaster durin g the Appraisal Process 10-40  \n28 Title Limitations 10-41  \nApp. \n1 Steps for Requesting an Appraisal  10-42  \n \n  \n \n\n--- PAGE 338 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 10:  Appraisal Process  \n \n10-3 \n 1.

Customer Service Expectations \n  \nChange Date March 11, 2019  \n This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. \n  \na. Appraiser \nExpectations Appraisers who are appointed to VA’s fee appraiser panel are well qualified, \nexperienced appraisers.  Fee panel appraisers are entrusted with the \nresponsibility of performing accurate and timely appraisals for VA’s Home \nLoan Guaranty program. While VA fee panel appraisers are not VA \nemployees, they are among the most visi ble participants in VA’s Home Loan \nGuaranty program.  Appraisers serv ing on VA’s fee appraiser panel are \nexpected to serve Vetera ns and their mortgage le nders in a professional \nmanner at all times. VA is committe d to providing the highest level of \ncustomer service to all Veterans.  \n  \nb. \nReassignments \nwithout Delay If the VA fee appraiser finds that the a ppraisal request must  be reassigned due \nto a conflict of interest or other valid reason, the a ppraiser must immediately \nnotif y the RLC to assi gn another appraiser.   \n  \nc. Appraisal \nStatus Fee appraisers may be co ntacted by lender and servi cer employees other than \nSARs inquiring about the status  of the appraisal.  Fee appraisers are expected \nto respond promptly, by the next busin ess day at the latest, providing an \nupdate on when the appraisal report is  expected to be completed.   \n  \nd. Email \nSubject Line Timesaver When communicating by email, place the VA Loan Identification Number \n(LIN) in the subject line. Do not incl ude any other information such as the \nborrower’s name or address due to privacy  concerns. Also state the reason for \nthe request. \n  \ne. Appraiser’s \nNotification to \na Lender When preparing an origination apprai sal for a purchase, if the estimated \nmarket value appears to be below the sale s price, the appraiser must notify the \nlender re gardin g additional market data (see Topic 8 of this chapte r). \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 346 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 10:  Appraisal Process  \n \n10-11 \n 6. Customer Service Expectations , continued  \n  \nf. Appraisal \nClarifications The appraiser may be contacted by the a ppraisal reviewer, ei ther a lender’s or \nservicer’s SAR or VA staff, to discuss the appraisal report.  Appraisers are \nrequired to respond by the next business day.  If a correction or clarification is \nneeded on the appraisal report, a comple te, revised appraisal report must be \nuploaded into WebLGY.  \n  \ng. Oversight The work of each fee appraiser is subject  to quality review.  Every appraisal \nreport is desk reviewed by a SAR or VA staff.  VA takes appropriate action, \nup to removal from VA’s fee appraiser pane l, when appraisers fail to meet \nVA’s expectations for customer service, accurac y, and timeliness.   \n  \n\n--- PAGE 347 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 10: Appraisal Process \n10-12 7.

Access to \nProperty When ordering appraisals, lenders shoul d provide contact in formation for the \nindividual who will provide the appraise r with access to the property without \nhavin g to make an y additional calls. \n  \nc. Website for \nTimeliness \nStandards Timeliness standards are developed by reviewing appraisal completion times \nin the market area for similar conven tional appraisal pr oducts.  Timeliness \nstandards are available at http://www.benefits.va.\ngov/HOMELOANS/appraiser _fee_schedule.asp  \n  \nd. Prompt \nScheduling of Appointment Appraisers must make contact to schedule an appointment within two \nbusiness days of receiving an assi gnment, documenting the activity in \nWebLGY to help ensure that a mutually  convenient appointment is scheduled \nand the appraisal is completed on time.   \n  \ne. Any Delays \nNoted in \nWebLGY The appraiser must place notes in WebLGY to inform the lender of any delays \nbeyond the appraiser’s contro l in obtaining access to view the interior of the \nproperty.  A timeliness exception may be allowed when valid extenuating \ncircumstances are documented in WebLGY.  Lenders should check WebLGY for up\ndates before contactin g appraisers. \n \nf. Appraisal \nReport \nCompletion  If a delay noted in WebLGY extends th e completion of th e appraisal beyond \nthe timeliness standard, the appraisal re port must be uploaded no later than 3 \nbusiness da y after the appointment.   \n \ng.

Steps for Requesting an Appraisal , continued \n \n  Step Action \n8 If the Veteran is purchasing a home, th e same day the assignment is made, the \nrequester must upload a copy of the sales contract and any construction \nexhibits into WebLGY. VA highly r ecommends the use of reduced-size \nconstruction drawings to save copyin g, mailing, and stor age costs for all \nparties involved. Building plans, elevati ons and details, traditionally drawn at \n¼ inch scale and larger, can be photog raphically reduced or computer-drawn \nto be clearly readable on 8½ by 14-in ch pages. Other exhibits normally \nprovided in an 8½ by 11-inch format (suc h as specifications, certifications, \netc.) must not be further reduced.  VA does not accept 11 by 17-inch pages as this size is not compatible with scanning equipment generally available to pro\ngram participants. \n9 For all appraisal types, if the legal desc ription is lengthy and does not fit in the \nlegal description block on the appraisa l request, a copy of the complete legal \ndescription must be uploaded into Web LGY the same day the assignment is \nmade. \n10 In most cases, the appraisal will be a ssigned instantly.  If an appraiser is not \nassigned by WebLGY, please notify the RL C of jurisdiction. Requesters must \nnot re-enter the information as a duplicate appraisal request will be generated. \n \n  \nRLC Contact \nInformation http://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/contact_cv.asp  or \nhttp://www.benefits.va. gov/HOMELOANS/contact _rlc_info.asp \n  \n \n \n  \n\n--- PAGE 379 ---\nChapter 11 Appraisal Report \nOverview \n  \nIn this \nChapter This Chapter contains the following topics. \n \nTopic Topic Name See \nPage \n1 Appraisal Reports 11-3 \n2 Market Value 11-4 \n3 Appraisal Report Contents 11-5 \n4 Gross Livin g Area 11-8 \n5 Room Additions and Car Stora ge Conversions 11-9 \n6 Accessor y Dwellin g Unit 11-10 \n7 Nuisances 11-11 \n8 Remainin g Economic Life 11-12 \n9 Effective A ge 11-13 \n10 Highest and Best Use 11-14 \n11 Farm Residences 11-15 \n12 Condominiums 11-16 \n13 Uniform Appraisal Dataset 11-19 \n14 Sales Comparison Approach 11-20 \n15 Cost Approach 11-23 \n16 Income Approach 11-24 \n17 Final Reconciliation 11-25 \n18 Appraisal Conditions 11-26 \n \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 380 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-2 Overview , continued \n \na.

Appraisal Reports \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019  \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. USPAP and \nVA Requirements The appraiser assigned by VA must prepar e the appraisal report in accordance \nwith Uniform Standards of Professi onal Appraisal Practice (USPAP), the \nspecific VA requirements outlined in this handbook, and in circulars periodicall\ny issued when pro gram chan ges arise.  \n \nb. Appraisers \nTrained by VA Appraisers who have been appointed to  VA’s fee appraiser panel have been \ntrained on VA appraisal requirements.  Lenders may rely on VA fee panel \nappraisers to have perf ormed the appraisal in acc ordance with VA guidelines \nwithout the need for additional statements or certifications.  \n \nc. SAR \nResponsibilities Lenders’ Staff Appraisal Reviewers (S ARs) who are reviewing appraisal \nreports must be familiar with resi dential appraisal pr inciples and VA’s \nspecific requirements fo r appraisal reports.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 382 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-4 2. Market Value \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Market \nValue Definition The appraiser must estimate the market va lue, as \"the most probable price that \na property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions \nrequisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, \nknowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.”  \nVA considers reasonable value and mark et value to be synonymous.  VA’s \ndefinition of market value is consistent with that used by Fannie Mae, Freddie \nMac, and ma jor appraisal or ganizations.  \n \nb. Protecting \nthe Interests of Veterans, Lenders, Servicers and \nVA The quality of the appraisa l is critical in protecting the interests of Veterans, \nlenders, servicers, and VA.  This fact requires VA to be integrally involved in \nits management and oversight of the appraisal process, from the initial \nassignment of the appraiser through the issuance of the Notice of Value \n(NOV), as well as oversight performed on closed loans. \n \nc. Oversight Any appraisal report is unacceptable if the analysis is not based upon \nrecognized appraisal practices and was intended to \"accommodate\" or \"meet\" \nthe sales price. \n \n\n--- PAGE 383 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-5 3.

Gross Living Area \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Definition Gross living area (GLA) refers to the square footage of the area that is \nfinished, habitable, contiguous, above-gr ade, residential sp ace calculated by \nmeasurin g the outside walls of the structure.  \n \nb. Non-\nContiguous \nAreas The functional utility and contribut ory value of any non-contiguous areas \nshould be considered by the appraiser and listed separately from the GLA on \nthe market data grid.  \n \nc. Basements Basements, whether or not finishe d, must not be included in the GLA.  \n \nd. Attics Finished attics ma y be included in the GLA.  \n \ne. Below-Grade \nAreas If any part of a finished level is belo w grade, the appraiser must determine \nwhether it should be considered GLA or valued separately.   \n If the appraiser determines that a part ially below-grade habitable space is \nsimilar to the GLA in de sign, quality of constructi on, and appeal, has full \nutility and is accepted in the market, th e appraiser may include the area in the \nGLA.  \n \nIf the partially below-grade space is inferi or to the rest of the property and not \naccepted in the market, the appraiser may de termine that the area is not part of \nthe GLA. In cases such as these, the contributory value of partially below-\ngrade space should be considered separatel y on the market data grid. \n \n\n--- PAGE 387 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-9 5. Room Additions and Car Storage Conversions \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. GLA \nConsiderations Room additions and enclosures of gara ges and carports into the living area \nshould be included in the GLA if the added space is:  \n accessible from the interior of th e main dwelling in a functional \nmanner, \n has a permanent and sufficient heat source, and \n is similar in design, qua lity of construction a nd appeal to the main \ndwellin\ng. \n \nb. Non-GLA \nAreas Valued Separately Added space that does not meet the criteria listed above must be valued \nseparately from the GLA on the market  data grid.  The appraiser must \nconsider the effect on mark etability of an inferior addition or conversion when \narriving at the line item adjustment for the added space. When selecting and \nanalyzing comparable sales, the appraise r should consider the differences in \nquality and utility of room additions  and converted spaces when compared \nwith ori ginally constructed space.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 388 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-10 6. Accessory Dwelling Unit \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Single Real \nEstate Entity An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is  a living unit including kitchen, \nsleeping, and bathroom faci lities added to or create d within a single-family \ndwelling, or detached on the same s ite.  A manufactured home on the site \ncould be an ADU. The dwelling and the ADU together constitute a single real \nestate entit y. \n \nb. Highest and \nBest Use As part of the highest an d best use analysis, the a ppraiser must determine if \nthe property is a single -family dwelling with an ADU, or a two-family \ndwelling.  The highest and best use mu st be a legal use (see Topic 10).  A \ntwo-family dwelling must  be appraised on the Fannie Mae Form 1025 , Small \nResidential Income Propert y Appraisal Report . \n \nc. ADU Valued \nSeparately An ADU is usually subordinate in size, location, and appearance to the \nprimary dwelling unit and may or may not have se parately metered utilities \nand separate means of ingress and egress.   The appraiser must not include the \nliving area of the ADU in the calculati on of the GLA of the primary dwelling. \nThe ADU must be valued separatel y as a line item on the market data grid. \n \nd. Notify the \nLender if More than One Unit The appraiser must notify the lender if  a property has mo re than one ADU. \n \ne. Detached \nBuildings A manufactured home, shed, or other de tached building on the property which \ndoes not have kitchen, sleeping, and bathro om facilities or cannot be legally \nused as a dwelling, may be valued as storage space if it does not present any \nhealth or safet y issues.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 389 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-11 7. Nuisances \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Effect on \nValue While nuisances do not make a property  ineligible or require repair, the \nappraiser must describe an y nuisances and consider an y effect on value.   \n \nb. Sales with \nSame Influence If available, comparable sales influe nced by the same nuisance, should be \nused by the appraiser. \n \nc. Examples Examples of nuisances include heavy tr affic, noise from a nearby highway, or \nodors from a factor y in the vicinit y.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 390 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-12 8. Remaining Economic Life \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Factors in \nEstimating Remaining Economic Life Remaining economic life is the es timated period of time until the \nimprovements are expected to no longer  serve their intended purpose as a \nhome.  In estimating the re maining economic life, the appraiser must consider: \n \n the relationship between the property and the economic stability of the \nblock, neighborhood, and community, \n comparisons with homes in the same or similar areas, \n the need for a home of the part icular type being appraised, \n the architectural design, style and fu nctional utility of the property, \n the condition and durability of the property, \n maintenance levels of other properties in the area, and \n in areas where municipalities have established code enforcement areas, \ntheir expected results in impro ving the neighborhood for residential \nuse. \n \n \nb. Comment if \nUnder 30 Years The appraiser must estimate the remain ing economic life as  a single number \nand include specific comments if the es timated remaining economic life is less \nthan 30 years. \n \nc. Reporting The estimated remaining economic life must  be provided in the cost approach \nsection of the appraisal report. For condominium units , the estimated \nremaining economic life must be provid ed in the “Reconciliation” section of \nthe appraisal report. \n \n\n--- PAGE 391 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-13 9. Effective Age \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Estimating \nEffective Age While the actual age is the number of  years since the home was constructed, \nthe effective age reflects the condition and functional ut ility of the property.  \nFor example, remodeling will likely d ecrease the effective age of a home \nwhile a lack of maintenance can incr ease the effective age, possibly to a \nnumber greater than the actual a ge.   \n \nb. Comment if \nSignificant Change From Actual Age The appraiser must state the effectiv e age as a single number and include \ncomments if the effective age differs significantly from the actual age.  \n \nc. Completed \nRepairs Considered Since recommended repairs are included in value on origination appraisals, \nthe effective age should reflect the c ondition of the property as repaired. \n \n\n--- PAGE 392 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-14 10.  Highest and Best Use \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Definition The highest and best use of a propert y is the most probable use which is \nphysically possible, appropriately suppor ted, legally permissible, financially \nfeasible, and results in the hi ghest value.    \n \nb. Appraisal to \nMeet VA Guidelines While the appraiser must determine the highest and best use, the appraiser \nmust also complete the appraisal in accordance with VA guidelines.  For example, since VA-guaranteed loans ar e made for residential purposes, no \nvalue may be given to commercial uses , crops, livestock, land for future \ndevelopment, or any other non-residential use. \n \n\n--- PAGE 393 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-15 11.  Farm Residences \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Farm \nResidence is an Eligible Property Although VA does not make farm or othe r business loans, Veterans may use \ntheir VA home loan benefit to purchase a property on which there is a farm \nresidence.  \n \nb. No Limit on \nNumber of \nAcres VA does not set a limit on the number of acres which the property may have.  \nThe appraisal of properties with acrea ge should not presen t difficulties if \nsimilar properties in the area were recentl y sold primaril y for residential use. \n \nc. Residential \nPurposes Considered in Valuation Improvements not typically considered residential, for example, barns, \ncorrals, or stables, must be valued by the appraiser as they contribute to the \nmarket value of the property for reside ntial purposes only.  The appraiser must \nnot include in value an y livestock, crops, or  farm equipment. \n \n\n--- PAGE 394 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-16 12.  Condominiums \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. \nCondominium Development Accepted by \nVA All condominium units, including site condominiums and manufactured home \ncondominiums, must be locat ed in a condominium deve lopment that has been \naccepted by VA prior to loan guaranty.  SARs receiving an appraisal for a \ncondominium unit in a devel opment that has not been  at least conditionally \naccepted b y VA ma y not issue the NOV. \n \nb. Avoid \nUnnecessary Appraisal Fee Ensuring that the condominium is accepted by VA before ordering the \nappraisal is recommended to avoid an unnecessary appraisal fee in the event \nthat the condominium is not accepted b y VA. \n \nc. Ineligible \nProperty Types Condo-hotel properties where units are placed in a rental pool and “air” \ncondominiums that do not have a homeowne rs association are not eligible for \nappraisal as these condominiums do not  meet VA guidelines.  If a question \narises as to whether or not a condominium would be accepted by VA, VA acceptance should be requested (see subsection \ng of this Topic). \n \nd. HUD/FHA \nReview Process VA no longer accepts HUD/FHA c ondominium approvals as the \ncondominium approval requirements di ffer from VA’s requirements.   \n \ne. Spot \nApprovals VA does not perform “spot” approval s of individual condominium units \nwithin a condominium development. \n \nf. \nCondominium List Available Online A list of VA-accepted condominium developments, with any conditions \nneeded for approval, and condomin ium ID numbers, may be found at \nhttps://vip.vba.va.gov/ portal/VBAH/Home  under “Featured Items” in “Condo \nReports”. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 395 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-17 12. Condominiums , continued  \n \ng. Documents \nNeeded for Review Lenders seeking VA acceptance of a condominium which has not already \nbeen reviewed by VA must establish a record for the condominium in WebLGY and upload the following documents  in PDF format in this stacking \norder: \n \n Declaration \n Bylaws \n Amendments \n Plat Map \n Rules and Regulations \n Meeting Minutes \n Budget \n Special Assessment Letter \n Litigation Letter \n Presale Letter \n An\ny additional documents \n \nh. Legal Review \nResults When the required documents are upload ed, the RLC will request a review by \nVA’s legal counsel.  The RLC will notify the requester of the results of the \nreview and update the status of the condominium in WebLGY. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 396 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-18 12. Condominiums , continued  \n \ni. Appraisal \nRequirements In most cases, the appraiser will prepare the appraisal on Fannie Mae Form \n1073 , Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report .  Appraisals of \nmanufactured home condominium units must be prepared on Fannie Mae \nForm 1004C , Manufactured Home Appraisal Report , with the details about \nthe condominium development usually pr ovided in the Project Information \nSection of the condominium appraisal fo rm included within the appraisal \nreport.  Liquidation appraisals of co ndominium units must be prepared on \nFannie Mae Form 1075 , Exterior-Only Inspection  Individual Condominium \nUnit Appraisal Report , if interior access wa s not provided.  In the \nCondominium Appraisal Repor t, the appraiser will: \n \n indicate which utilities are included in the monthly \nhomeowners association fee, \n comment on the adequacy of the monthly assessment, \nbased upon the appraiser’s opinion of the adequacy of the \nproject’s budget and a comparison to similar \ncondominium developments, \n recommend a fair assessment if the current assessment is \nconsidered inadequate, and  \n report any known pending litig ation involving the subject \ncondominium development or its homeowners \nassociation.  \n \nj. Pre-sale \nRequirement For new condominium developments, a pr e-sale requirement of 70 percent \nmust be include d on the NOV and satisfied prior to VA loan guarant y. \n \nk. Wood-\ndestroying Insect Reports A wood-destroying insect inspection is not required on units in low-rise or \nhigh-rise condominiums (un its are stacked vertically ), unless the appraiser \nnotes a potential infestation probl em.  For site condominiums and \nvilla/townhome style condominiums wher e units are side by side, located in a \n“very heavy” or “moderate to heav y” zone, a wood-destroying insect \ninspection must be required on th e NOV unless evidence of a treatment \nguarantee has been provided b y the homeowners association.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 397 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-19 13. Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Definition The UAD improves the quality and consis tency of appraisal data by defining \nall fields required on specific appraisa l forms and standardizes definitions and \nresponses for a key subset of fields. Regardless of the geographic location of \nthe property or any localized reportin g conventions, the UAD standardization \nincludes:  \n Formats for fields that include dates, values, and other data,  \n Allowable values from a list of ch oices provided for certain fields, \n Abbreviations to allow more inform ation to fit on printed appraisal \nforms, and  \n Ratings and definitions for the “Condition” and “Quality” of the \npropert\ny and “Updated/Rem odeled” status. \n \nb. UAD-\nCompliant \nForms Appraisals prepared on Fannie Mae Forms 1004 , 1073 , 1075  or 2055  must be \nUAD-compliant and must include the de finitions for the property condition \nand qualit y ratin gs and the propert y description abbr eviations used.  \n \nc. VA Requires \nClosed Sales While the UAD may allow for the use of pending sales in the sales \ncomparison grid, VA requires that onl y close d sales be used. \n \nd. Remodeling \nInformation UAD requires appraisers to provide  specific information regarding \nremodeling in the past 15 years.  VA expects fee appraisers to recognize and \ndescribe remodeling or updating and to make appropriate adjustments. Fee \nappraisers should also report UAD info rmation concerning the remodeling if \nit is available in the “normal course  of business” within VA timeliness \nrequirements for completion of the appraisal. \n \ne. UAD \nCondition Ratings Since origination appraisals are prepared  “subject to” any repairs needed for \nthe property to meet MPRs, UAD cond ition ratings of C5 and C6 are not \nappropriate. \n \n\n--- PAGE 398 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-20 14. Sales Comparison Approach \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Comparable \nSale Selection The appraiser must include, at a min imum, three closed sales which the \nappraiser believes are the best avai lable sales and provide comments to \nsupport the selection, when appropriate.  Comparable sales should be selected \nbased on similar locational and physical characteristic s, not sales price.  \nRecent sales in the same establishe d subdivision, condominium or PUD are \ntypically the best indicators of value.   The sales should be similar to the \nsubject property to the extent that th e sales would be competing properties if \nthey were on the market at the same time as the sub ject propert y. \n \nb. Comments \nExplaining Adjustments The appraiser should provide comment s when adjustments are made for \npoints of comparison that are not self-explanatory or  when large adjustments \nare made.  Providing detailed commentary  about the market and comparable \nselection ma y reduce the number of requests for revisions of appraisals. \n \nc. Limited Sales \nData If the sales data from the market area is  limited, the appraiser must provide the \nbest information available and comment s with the apprai ser’s professional \nopinion about the market, any reasons fo r the lack of sales data, and the \nvarious differences between the sub ject and the comparable sales. \n \nd. Distance of \nComparable Sales VA does not set minimum or maximum distance requirements between the \nsubject and comparable sale  properties.  In suburban or rural communities, the \nmarket areas may be greatly expanded a nd suitable comparable sales may be \nmany miles away from the subject. In su ch cases, the appraiser should specify \nwhy those comparable sales were us ed and how they compare with the \nsubject.  \n \ne. Sales of REO \nProperties The appraiser may use sales of Real Es tate Owned (REO) properties or short \nsales if transactions of this nature ar e prevalent in the market.  A transaction \ninvolving a foreclosure transfer to a mo rtgage servicer is not evidence of \nmarket value and must not be c onsidered as a comparable sale. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 399 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-21 14. Sales Comparison Approach , continued  \n \nf. Sales From \nCompeting Developments If the property is in a new subdivision or condominium, the appraiser should \ninclude, if available for comparison, properties constructed by a competing \nbuilder in the subject market area as well as properties within the subject subdivision or condominium. \n \ng. Market-\nderived Adjustments All adjustments on the market data gr id should be market-derived, based on \nthe amount the appraiser estimates a t ypical buyer would pay for the item in \nthe market.  Adjustments reflect contri butory value in the market, which does \nnot necessaril y equal the cost of an item. \n \nh. Sales \nConcessions Sales concessions typically include financ ing incentives or non-realty items.  \nAs all adjustments must be market-der ived, the adjustment should reflect the \ndifference between the sale s price with the sales concessions, and what the \nproperty would have sold for without the concessions under typical market \nconditions.  The sales concessions on th e comparable proper ties are adjusted \nto typical market expectations, not to the specific terms or conditions of the \nsale of the subject. Any concessi on adjustments must be downward \nadjustments as positive ad justments for sales concessions are not acceptable. \n \ni. Recent Sales Comparable sales should reflect the most recent activity in the market.  \nComparable sales are preferably sales that have taken place within the last 6 months, and generally sales that are not more than 12-months old, unless \nexplained b\ny the appraiser.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 400 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-22 14. Sales Comparison Approach , continued  \n \nj. Time \nAdjustments Market condition (time) adjustments are ma de to reflect value changes in the \nmarket between the date of the contra ct for the comparable sale and the \neffective date of the appr aisal.  The appraiser mu st provide comments about \ncurrent market trends to support any time adjustments.   In an increasing market, positive mark et condition adjustments should be \nmade if there is evidence, based on a thorough analysis of specific market \ntrends, of increasing prices, a shorta ge of homes for sale, or decreasing \nmarketing times.  In a declining market, ne gative market condition adju stments should be made \nif there is evidence of a decline in prices, an  oversupply, or extended \nmarketin\ng times.  \n \nk. Condition \nAdjustments Since VA appraisals must be prepared “subject to ” the completion of any \nrepairs needed in order for the proper ty to meet VA’s MPRs (see Chapter 12 \nof this handbook), the condition for the subject property compared with the \ncomparable sales on the market data gr id should reflect the condition with the \nrepair items completed.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 401 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-23 15. Cost Approach \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Not Required \nby VA The cost approach is not required fo r VA purposes, but may be completed to \nsupplement the indicated value in  the sales comparison approach. \n \nb. Site Value If the cost approach is provided, the a ppraiser must estimate the site value \nthrough sales comparison, allocation, or ex traction.  If the cost  approach is not \ncompleted, a site value must not be provided. \n \n\n--- PAGE 402 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-24 16. Income Approach \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Residential \nIncome Properties If appraising a residential income pr operty with two to four units, the \nappraiser must prepar e the appraisal on the Freddie Mac Form 72 / Fannie Mae \nForm 1025 , Small Residential Income Pr operty Appraisal Report, which \nincludes an income approach \n \nb. Other \nProperty Types VA does not require an income appro ach on any other property types.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 403 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-25 17. Final Reconciliation \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Approaches \nto Value Considered In the final reconciliation on the apprai sal report the appraiser will evaluate \nand summarize the approaches to value which were included in the appraisal report. \n \nb. Market \nApproach  On appraisals prepared for VA, the market approach will likely reflect the \nappraiser’s final estimate of value si nce VA does not require a cost approach \nand an income approach is onl y required on two to f our unit properties.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 404 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-26 18.  Appraisal Conditions \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. As-is The appraisal will be prepared “as-is” if: \n the appraiser finds that the pr operty meets MPRs on origination \nappraisals, or \n the assignment is a liquidation appraisal (see Topic 20 of this \nChapte r). \n \nb. Subject to \nRepairs The appraisal will be prepared “subject to the following repa irs or alterations \non the basis of a hypothetical condition th at the repairs or alterations have \nbeen completed” if:  \n on an origination appraisal, the appr aiser recommends that repairs be \ncompleted for the property to meet MPRs, \n customer preference items must be  completed on a new construction \nproperty, or \n alterations are bein\ng made to the propert y. \n \nc. Subject to \nCompletion Proposed construction properties will be appraised “subject to completion per \nplans and specifications.” \n \nd. Recommend \nRepairs, Not \nInspections When an appraiser observes an item  that does not meet VA MPRs, the \nappraiser must recommend a repair, not an inspection.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 405 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-27 19.  Appraiser Training a New Appraiser \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Training for \nNew Appraisers VA understands the importance of a ppraisers providing training to new \nappraisers and is supportive of appraise rs who are dedicati ng their time to \ntrainin g others who are pursuin g a career as an appraiser.   \n \nb. Visiting \nProperties Trainees may accompany the VA-assigned appraiser when visiting the \npropert y. \n \nc. Assistance \nFrom Trainee A trainee or another apprai ser may assist in any part  of the appraisal yet the \nanalysis establishing value must be  performed by the VA-assigned fee \nappraiser.  The appraiser must select the comparable sales, perform all critical analyses contained in the appraisal re port, and prepare the Market Conditions \nAddendum.  \n \nd. Reporting \nTrainee’s Name and Work Performed If a trainee or another appraiser provid ed assistance or participated in the \npreparation of the appraisal, the appr aiser must provide the name of the \ntrainee or appraiser in th e report and describe thei r role in developing the \nappraisal.  Onl y the VA-assi gned fee appraiser ma y sign the appraisal report.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 406 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-28 20. Liquidation Appraisals \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Requested by \nthe Servicer When a VA-guaranteed loan is in defa ult, a liquidation appraisal should be \nrequested by the servicer no later than  30 days prior to the estimated or \nscheduled sale date. \n \nb. Timeliness \nStandard The timeliness requirement for liquidation appraisals is 5 business days (see \nChapter 10, Section 7 of this handboo k). \n \nc. Servicer to \nAssist Appraiser in \nObtaining \nAccess to the Property Servicers are required to assist the appraiser in obtaining access to the interior \nof the property and should provide:  \n for occupied properties, the name and telephone number of the current \nor last known occupant, or \n for vacant properties, the location of the keys to the property or contact \ninformation for a person who can prom ptly provide the appraiser with \naccess to the inte\nrior of the propert y. \n \nd. Occupied \nProperty Access \nAttempts If the property is occupied, the apprai ser must gain access to the interior, \nunless:  \n the owner or occupant has permanen tly refused the appraiser’s request \nfor access, \n the appraiser considers access to present a legitimate hazard, \n at least one attempt to visit the property and two or more calls, on \ndifferent days and times to increas e the likelihood of reaching the \noccupant, have not resu lted in access, or  \n the appraiser has made three appoin tments, all of which have been \nbroken. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 407 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-29 20. Liquidation Appraisals , continued  \n \ne. Vacant \nProperty Access Attempts If the property is vacant, th e appraiser must gain access to the interior, unless: \n \n jurisdictional law prohibits the lender from gaining or assisting in \ngaining access to the property, and the RLC has waived such access, \n on a case-by-case basis, the RLC has waived access after considering \nother valid extenuating circumstance s (such as, the owner’s personal \neffects remain in a va cant property causing le gitimate concern about \nexposure to litigation), or \n the RLC has approved a request to wa ive the servicer’s responsibility \nto assist the appraiser in obtainin g access.  \n \nf. Requirements \nif No Access Gained If interior access is not gained, the appraiser must: \n \n make reasonable efforts to verify  the interior condition by the best \navailable means, for example, info rmation from listings of the property \non the market, or property assessment records, and  \n make reasonable assump tions about the interior  condition as well as \nany potential MPR and cosmetic repairs. \n \ng. No Borrower \nto be Named on \nthe Appraisal Since there is no borrower on a liquidation appraisal, the appraiser must insert \n“n/a” in the “Borrower” field.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 408 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-30 20. Liquidation Appraisals , continued \n \nh. As-is value The fee appraiser’s value estimate for a ll liquidation appraisals will be for the \nsubject property in its “as is” condition.  VA li quidation appraisals are \nprepared under the same definition of ma rket value as origination appraisals, \nnot a discounted or forced sale value.   Consequently, a property which needs \nno repairs should appraise for the same va lue on a liquidation appraisal and an \norigination appraisal. \n \ni. Liquidation \nAddendum An addendum to the liquidation appraisal must be provided with the following \ninformation:  \n whether the property is occupied or vacant, \n whether or not access to the interior was gained, \n if access was not gained, details of  attempts to gain access must be \nprovided in accordance with item d or e above, \n if the property is vacant, whether or not the property was secure,  \n any repairs urgently needed, su ch as securing the dwelling or \nsecuring a swimming pool, \n information about three current list ings or pending sales, including \nthe length of time on the market, th e current listing price, any known \nprice changes, and a short statem ent describing how each property \ncompares to the subject property, and \n an itemized list of any MPR repair items and any cosmetic items that \naffect the marketability of the prop erty, with the estimated cost and \nthe estimated contributory value of each item.  The total contributory \nvalue of all repairs listed should be  considered by the appraiser when \nmaking condition adjustments on th e market data grid since \nliquidation appraisals are completed “as is”. \n \n\n--- PAGE 409 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-31 21. Partial Release Appraisals \n \nChange Date February 22, 2019 \n This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Partial \nRelease Appraisal Request When an appraisal is needed in order to  review a request for a partial release \nof security, VA will assign the appraiser.  The servicer of the VA loan must  \ne-mail a request for an apprai sal for a partial release of security to the RLC of \njurisdiction.  Neither VA Form 26-1805 , Request for Determination of \nReasonable Value,  nor WebLGY will be used to request a partial release \nappraisal.  The request must in clude the following information: \n \n Name and address of the servicer, \n E-mail address of the servicer,  \n VA case number (remains the same from origination of loan), \n Property address, \n Name of the property owner and co ntact number for property access, \n Plot plan or survey of the prope rty showing the pr oposed partition, \n Identification of the parcel to remain after partial release is \ncompleted, \n Legal description for each parcel, \n Reason for the release of the property (for example, sale, public \ntaking, designation as conservation site), and \n Confirmation that the appraisal f ee will be paid to the VA-assigned \nappraiser upon completion of the ap praisal report and submission of \nan invoice. \n \nb. Appraisal \nFee The fee for an appraisal for partial rel ease of security purposes is not fixed \nand could vary from the typi cal origination appraisal fee.  The appraisal fee \nwill be established by VA, on a case-by-case basis, after consulting with the appraiser. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 410 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 11: Appraisal Report \n11-32 21.

Minimum Property Requirement Procedures\nChange Date  October 18, 2019 \n•This chapter has been revised in its entirety.\na.MPRs VA has established Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs) to protect the \ninterests of Vetera ns, lenders, servicers, and VA. Properties must meet these \nrequirements prior to guaranty of the loan by VA.    \nb. Appraisal is\nNot a H ome\nInspectionWhile VA -assigned fee appraisers must note any readily apparent repairs that \nare needed, it is important to distinguish the differences between a real estate \nappraisal and a home inspection report. The fee appraiser will not perform operational checks of mechanical systems or appliances. The fee appraiser estimates the value of the property to ensure that it is sufficient for the amount \nof the proposed loan.  \nc. Safe, Sound,\nSanitaryMPRs help ensure that the property is safe, structurally sound, and sanit ary.  \nThe scope of MPRs also includes issues related to the property’s location and \nlegal considerations.  \nd. Appraisal\nSubject to\nRepairs to\nmeet MPRsThe appraiser will prepare origination appraisals “subject to” the completion \nof any MPR repairs that appear to be needed and include the contributory value of the completed repairs in the estimated market value.  Liquidation \nappraisals are prepared “as -is” (see Chapter 11, Topic 20 of this Handbook ). \ne. Recommend\nRepairs, N ot\nInspectionsAppraisers must not prepare appra isals subject to inspections. The appraiser \nmust recommend repairs, not inspections, for any conditions that do not appear \nto meet MPRs.   \nf. Cosmetic\nItemsThe appraiser should not recommend repairs of cosmetic items, items \ninvolving minor deferred maintenance or normal wear and tear, or items that are inconsequential in relation to the overall condition of the property. While minor repairs should not be recommended, the appraiser should consider these items in the overall condition rating when estimating the market value of the \nproperty.   \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 415 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements \n12-41. Minimum Property Requirement Procedures,  continued\ng.Detached\nImprovementsDetached sheds or other improvments  on the site may be included in value if \nthe improvement meets VA’s MPRs.  If the improvement does not meet MPRs \nit must be excluded from value.  If the improvement presents a health or safety hazard, the appraisal must be completed subject to the removal of the \nimprovement.  \nh.Home\nInspection\nRecommendedAfter an origination appraisal is completed, the Notice of Value (NOV) that is \nissued to the Veteran includes a recommendation that the Veteran may wish to \nobtain a home inspection (see Chapter 13, Appendix A of this Handbook). \ni.Local\nRequirementsInformation about MPRs concerning properties in specific l ocations are listed \nby state at \nhttp://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/appraiser_cv_local_req.asp .   \nj. SAH Additional MPRs apply to Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) program cases.  \nThe Regional Loan Center ( RLC ) of jurisdiction should be contacted for \nassistance with SAH questions.  \n\n--- PAGE 416 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements \n12-52. Marketable Real Estate Entity\nChange Date  October 18, 2019 \n•This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.\na. Single Real\nEstate EntityThe property must be a single, readily marketable , real estate entity.  \nb. Multiple\nParcelsMore than one parcel or lot may be included as long as all of the property is \ncontiguous and legally marketable. VA does not set a limit on the number of \nacres that the property may have. If the property being appraised includes \nmore than one parcel, the appraisal must be prepared subject to placing all of \nthe parcels on one deed.  \nc. Road or\nWaterwayDividing the\nPropertyIf a property is divided by a road or waterway, the appraiser must determine \nthe effect on the utility of the property to ensure that t he property is a readily \nmarketable, real estate entity.  \n\n--- PAGE 417 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements \n12-63. Space Requirements\nChange Date  March 28, 2019  \n•This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.\na. Space\nRequirementsEach living unit must have sufficient space for:  \n•liv\ning,\n•sleeping,\n•cooking and dining, and\n•sanitary facilities.\nb. Non -\nStandard\nConstructionNon-standard house styles which may be unique in a market area, for example, \nlog houses, earth sheltered houses, dome houses, and houses with lower than \nnormal ceiling heights, must meet any local building codes. The appraiser \nmust consider the marketability of the home in the appraisal.  \n\n--- PAGE 418 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26- 7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements  \n \n12-7 \n 4. Access  \n \nChange Date  March 28, 2019  \n• This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \na. Street \nAccess  Each property must be provided with a  safe and adequate pedestrian or \nvehicular access from a public or private street with an all -weather surface.  \n \nb. Private \nRoad \nRequirements  Private roads must be:  \n \n• protected by a permanent easement, and  \n• maintained by a homeowners association or joint m aintenance \nagreement.  \n \nc. \nMaintenance \nAgreement \nSignatures  If a maintenance agreement does not exist, every effort should be made to \nobtain the agreement of all owners of properties on the private road to share the cost of maintaining the road.  \n \nd. RLC \nApproval \nRequired if the Veteran is Accepting \nAdditional \nResponsibility  In the absence of an agreement signed by all owners, particularly those of \nproperties located between the subject property and the public road, an agreement by a Veteran to accept respo nsibility for a disproportionate share of \nthe road must be reasonable in regards to the distance from the subjec t \nproperty to the public road. The RLC of jurisdiction must be contacted in order to approve the agreement. VA will not accept an agreement in w hich the \nVeteran accepts sole responsibility for maintaining an unreasonable distance of the private road as this could create a burden for the Veteran as well as \nfuture property owners.  \n \ne. Private \nStreet in PUD \nor \nCondominium  If private street maintena nce is covered in the organizational documents for a \nplanned unit development ( PUD)  or condominium, or by state law, the NOV \nmay be issued without a requirement for further documentation. \n \nf. Easements \nMust R un with \nthe L and Each living unit must be acces sible without passing through any other living \nunit or trespass ing on adjoining properties. Any easements required must run \nwith the land.   \nContinued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 419 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26- 7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements  \n \n12-8 \n 4.

For a row -type dwelling, the access may be by means of  \n \n• an alley,  \n• easement, or  \n• passing through the subject dwelling.  \n \nh. Exterior \nWall Access  Adequate space to perform maintena nce of the exterior walls must be present \nbetween buildings.  \n \ni. Property \nConstructed \nAdjacent to \nAnother \nProperty  Line  A building constructed on or next to a property line must be separated from the \nadjoining building by a wall extending the full height of the building from the foundation to the ridge of the roof.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 420 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements \n12-95.Encroachments\nChange Date  March 28, 2019  \n•This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.\na. \nEncroachments  The appraiser must report any apparent encroachments of the subject’s \ndwelling, garage, or other improvements onto an adjacent property, right-of-\nway, utility easement, or building restriction line and any apparent encroachments of a neighboring dwelling, garage, or other improvements onto \nthe subject property.  \nb. Prompt\nNotificationThe appraiser must notify the lender of the encroachment promptly to provide \nas much time as possible to resolve the issue.  \n\n--- PAGE 421 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26- 7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements  \n \n12-10 \n 6.

Grading  The site must be graded so that it  \n \n• provides positive, rapid drainage away from the perimeter walls of the \ndwelling, and  \n• prevents ponding of water on the site.  \n \nb. \nTopographic \nConditions  The appraiser must report any danger due to topographic conditions, such as \nmudslides from adjoining properties, falling rocks , or avalanches.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 422 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements \n12-117. Ge ological or Soil Instability, Subsidence, and Sinkholes\nChange Date October 18, 2019 \n•This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.\na. Soil\nConditionsThe appraiser must report any readily observable soil conditions of the site, \nand other physical features that affect the value of the site. The appraiser \nshould also consider any published reports regarding the instability of the soil and surface support of the land concerning the subject and nearby properties. The appraiser must consider any effect on the estimated market value of the \nproperty.  \nb. Subsidence  Subsidence may be encountered where homes are constructed on uncontrolled\nfill or unsuitable soil, in locations near mining activity or extractio n of \nsubsurface minerals (to include fracking), or where the subsoil or subsurface is unstable and subject to slippage or expansion.  Signs of subsidence may include cracks in the terrain, sinkholes, foundation damage or settlement \nproblems.  \nc. Dangerous\nSubsidence or\nSinkholesThe appraiser must report any probable or imminent danger of subsidence or \nsinkholes.  Depending on the extent of the problem, it could be considered a hazard (see Topic 20 of this Chapter) which would make the property \nineligible.   The appraiser must notify the lender promptly when a hazardous \ncondition is found.  \nd. Repairs by\nContractorIf a settlement problem that does not have the severity of a hazard is apparent, \nthe appraisal must be prepared “subject to repair” by a licensed contractor (for example, step -cracks in an exterior wall, or cracked flooring with significant \nvertical displacement).  \ne. Hairline\nCracksMinor h airline cracks due to expansion or normal settlement that are common \nin the market area  do not typic ally require repair.  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 423 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26- 7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements  \n \n12-12 \n 7. Geological or Soil Instability, Subsidence, and Sinkholes , \ncontinued \n \nf. New or \nProposed \nProperty  For new or proposed construction properties, in areas that have a history of \ngeological or soil instability, the builder must submit either: \n  \n• a certification that to the best of the builder’s knowledge and belief, \nany geological or soil -related hazard has been compensated for in the \nengineering design of the improvements and no portion of the \nconstruction will rest on fill, or  \n• evidence from a qualified geologist or engineer that the subject site \neither does not present unusual geological soils -related hazards or such \nhazards have been compensated for in the en gineering design of the \nimprovements.  (Qualified geologists are state licensed or are a \nmember of a national or state organization which requires responsibility, experience, education and demonstrated ability in the \nfield of engineering geology.)  \n \n\n--- PAGE 424 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements \n12-138.

Flood\nInsuranceProperties located in a FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) must be \ncovered by a flood insurance policy.  Properties located in a SFHA are not \neligible if flood insurance is not available.  \nb. Regular\nFloodingBased on the app raiser’s knowledge of the market area,  properties that are \nsubject to regular flooding are not eligible, whether or not the area has been \ndesignated an SFHA.  \nc. Verification\nof Flood ZoneWhile appraisers must provide flood zone information on the appraisal report, \nflood zone maps do not typically indicate the location of specific properties.  \nLenders are responsible for verifying the flood zone information.  \nd. Flood\nZonesSFHAs are usually designated Zones A, AO, AH, A1 -A30, AE, A99, AR, \nAR/AE, AR/AO, AR/A1 -A30, AR/A, V, VE, and V1-V30.  Flood insurance is \nnot required in Zones B, C, X, and D.  \ne. Excluding\nNon-\nResidential\nImprovementsAt the Veteran’s reque st, non -residential improvements such as detached \ngarages and small sheds may be excluded from the flood insurance policy if \nthey are also excluded from the appraised value.  The cost of flood insurance with and without coverage for the detached building s hould be compared as \nexcluding a detached building may not be worthwhile.   \nf. Private\nFlood\nInsuranceVeterans may elect to obtain private flood insurance instead of obtaining flood \ninsurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.  \n\n--- PAGE 425 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26- 7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements  \n \n12-14 \n 9.

Energy \nEfficient \nMortgages  Energy efficient m ortgages are described in Chapter 7  of this Handbook .  \nVeterans are provided information about this program in item #1a on NOVs \nissued for existing properties  (see Chapter 13, Appendix A of this Handbook) .    \n \nb. Energy \nConservation \nEncouraged  VA encourages home i mprovements that conserve energy, reduce water usage, \nenhance safety or strengthen disaster preparedness.   \n \n\n--- PAGE 463 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26- 7, Revised  \nChapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements  \n \n12-52 \n 44. Requests for Waiver of MPR Repairs  \n \nChange Date  March 28, 2019  \n• This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.  \n \na. Waiver \nRequested by \na Veteran  After the NOV has been issued, at the request of the Veteran, VA will consider \nwaiving MPR repairs if the following conditions are met: \n \n• the request is signed by the Veteran,  \n• the lender concurs with the Veteran’s request,  and \n• the property is habit able from the standpoint of safety, structural \nsoundness , and sanitation. \n \nThese requests should not allow for the Veteran to waive MPRs that could \nresult in safety issues with the home.  \n \nb. Inspection \nReport  In support of the waiver request, while not required, providing an inspection \nreport from a licensed professional who is qualified to assess the condition of \nthe item in question will ensure the Veteran is fully informed about the \ncondition of the item.  \n \nc. \nContributory Value If the request is app roved, VA staff will amend the NOV, removing the repair \nrequirement(s). Since appraisals are prepared “subject to” repairs, VA staff may reduce the value by the contributory value of the waived repair(s).  If the contributory value of the repair item(s) is  not material, the NOV may be issued \nwithout a change in value.  \n \nd. Materials \nShortage \nFollowing a \nNatural \nDisaster  Following a natural disaster, shortages of materials could delay the completion \nof repairs.  The RLC of jurisdiction should be contacted for consideration of repair waivers  on a case- by-case basis when a Veteran wishes to proceed with \npurchasing or refinancing a home in need of repairs when needed materials are \nnot readily available.  \n \ne. Escrowed \nFunds for \nCompletion of \nRepairs  Depending o n the nature of required repairs, it may be advantageous for the \nVeteran to have the MPR repairs completed after closing on the loan. Lenders \nmay hold funds in escrow for repairs to be completed after closing, however all repairs must be completed and escr owed funds distributed before the loan \nmay be guaranteed by VA.      \n \n\n--- PAGE 464 ---\nChapter 13 Notices of Value \nOverview \n \nIn this  \nChapter This chapter contains  the following topics. \n \nTopic Topic Name See \n Page \n1 Issuin g the Notice of Value 13-2 \n2 Scope of Appraisal Review 13-3 \n3 Appraisal Review Process 13-4 \n4 Appraisal Mana gement S ystem  13-6 \n5 Notice of Value Timeliness Expectation 13-8 \n6 Appraisal Review Reference Materials 13-9 \n7 Notice of Value Validit y Perio d 13-10 \n8 Notice of Value Conditions 13-11 \nAppendix A Notice of Value Sample Lette r 13-16 \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 465 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-2 \n 1. Issuing the Notice of Value \n \nChange Date July 22, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. Appraisal \nUploaded in \nWebLGY When the fee appraiser uploads the completed appraisal report into WebLGY, \na lender’s Staff Appraisal Reviewer (S AR) or VA staff must review the \nappraisal and issue a Notice of Value (NOV) to the Veteran.   \n \nb. Purpose of \nNOV The NOV will inform the Vete ran about the results of the appraisal report and \nconditions that must be met for guara nty of the loan. The NOV explains how \nappraisal reports differ fr om home inspections and s uggests that the Veteran \nmay wish to obtain a home inspection.  \n \nc. Processing \nunder LAPP Every property eligible for VA’s Le nder Appraisal Processing Program \n(LAPP) should be processed accordingly.  If a LAPP-approved lender does not process an eligible property under LAPP, the request for VA staff to issue \nthe NOV must include a detailed explanation. \n \nd. NOV \nReflects Conditions \nRequired for \nthe Loan to be Guaranteed Since the NOV reflects the results of  the appraisal review, lenders and \nservicers should refer to th e NOV, not the appraisal, for the reasonable value, \nrepair requirements, and all other appr aisal-related conditions required for the \nloan to be guaranteed by VA.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 466 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-3 \n 2. Scope of Appraisal Review \n \nChange Date July 22, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entirety. \n \na. SAR’s \nCertification of Appraisal \nReview When issuing an NOV in WebLGY, the SAR must electroni cally certify the \nfollowing: “ I reviewed this appraisal report to  determine the acceptability of \nthe property for VA Loan Guaranty purposes  in light of VA minimum property \nrequirements and the appropriateness, completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the fee appraiser’s reasonabl e value determination. In completing \nthis administrative review , I am performing a due diligence function and not \nacting as, or taking the responsibility of, a cosigner of the report or \nsupervisory appraiser.  Any disagreement s or comments, etc., resulting from \nthe administrative review of this appraisal are fully explained on the \nattachment to this report. ”  (WebLGY notes are considered “the attachment to \nthis report” referenced in this certification).  \n \nb. SAR’s \nResponsibilities By making this certification together w ith the certifications already made \nwhen initially approved by VA, the SAR is certifying that he/she: \n \n personally reviewed the appraisal re port (see Topic 3 of  this Chapter), \n concurred with the fee apprai ser’s recommendation, except as \nnoted in WebLGY notes, \n did not exert pressure or undue infl uence on the appraiser to change \ninformation or to reach a predeter mined value for the subject property \nin order to accommodate the sale price or mortgage transaction, and \n determined that the appraiser used methodologies that were \nappropriate and reasonable in li ght of industry-accepted appraisal \ntechniques, made conclusions that  were consistent, based upon the \ndata in the report, and complied with applicable VA requirements. \n \n  \n \n\n--- PAGE 467 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-4 \n 3. Appraisal Review Process \n \nChange Date April 12, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na. Appraisal \nReport and Electronic Scoring After the appraiser uploads the comple ted appraisal report, the SAR must \nreview the appraisal and the results of the electronic scoring of the appraisal \nby VA’s Appraisal Management System  (see Topic 4 of this Chapter). \n \nb. Property \nEligibility and VA Appraisal Guidelines The SAR must ensure that: \n \n the property is eligible, and \n the appraisal report meets VA guideli nes as outlined in Chapters 10, \n11, and 12 of this Handboo k. \n \nc. MPR Repairs The SAR must review the appraiser’ s recommendations for any VA Minimum \nProperty Requirement (MPR) repairs and ensure that the property meets or \nwill meet VA’s MPRs.  The SAR must  limit repairs required on the NOV to \nonly those repairs that are needed for th e property to meet MPRs.  SARs must \nplace notes in WebLGY justifying an y non-MPR repairs or inspections \nrecommended by appraisers that the SA R has determined are not required on \nthe NOV. \n \nd. \nClarifications \non the Appraisal During the review of an appraisal, in most cases, when a question arises, the \nSAR should first contact the appraiser for any needed clarifications and \ncorrections. The SAR must document a ny contact with the appraiser and \nresolution of appraisal-related concer ns in WebLGY notes. Customer service \nexpectations are covered in Ch apter 10, Topic 6 of this Handboo k. \n \ne. Appraisal \nRevisions If the appraiser makes any changes to  the appraisal report, the revised \nappraisal report must be uploaded into WebLGY. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 468 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-5 \n 3. Appraisal Review Process , continued  \n \nf. Questions not \nResolved by an Appraiser If the question is not resolved after c ontacting the appraiser, the SAR should \nemail the RLC for assistance.  VA staff will assist the SAR in resolving the question concernin\ng the appraisal.  \n \ng. Property Not \nEligible SARs must not issue an NOV for a pr operty that cannot reasonably be \nexpected to meet eligibility or VA MPRs  prior to loan guaranty (see Chapters \n10, 11, and 12 of this Handboo k).  \n \nh. NOV to \nReflect Appraiser’s \nEstimate of \nMarket Value Once the SAR has determined the apprai sal report is acceptable to VA, the \nSAR must issue the NOV in WebLGY at th e appraised value.  If contact with \nthe appraiser resulted in the appraise r uploading an amended appraisal report \nwith a changed value, the SAR must issue the NOV at the changed (current) value.  \n \ni. Electronic \nIssuance of an NOV The SAR is not required to sign the NOV in ink since the SAR’s name and \nVA-issued ID number are automati cally included on the NOV.  This \nconstitutes an electroni c signature since SARs log into WebLGY with a \nunique user name and password. \n \nj. NOV \nProvided to the \nVeteran The same day the NOV is issued, the SAR must send the Veteran a copy of \nthe NOV together with a copy of the appraisal report. \n \nk. Actions after \nthe NOV Issued After the NOV has been issued: \n employees of lenders associated with the case will be able to view and \ndownload copies of the a ppraisal and NOV from WebLGY, \n Veterans may request a waiver of a repair requirement (see Chapter \n12, Topic 45 of this Handbook), and  \n interested parties may re quest a reconsideration of value (see Chapter \n10, Topic 22 of this Handboo k). \n \n\n--- PAGE 469 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-6 \n 4. Appraisal Mana gement System  \n \nChange Date July 22, 2019  \n This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. \n \na. Electronic \nScoring of the Appraisal When the appraiser uploads the comp leted appraisal report into WebLGY, \nVA’s Appraisal Management System (AMS) will electronically read and \nscore the appraisal, assisting SARs in quickly assessing appraisal risk, \ndetermining property eligibility, ensuring VA policy compliance and \nidentifying over/under-valuations, and a ppraisal quality issues. SARs must \nuse AMS as a tool to help ensure appr aisals are accurate, complete, and that \nthe property is properly valued accordi ng to VA-accepted appraisal principles \nand practices. \n \nb. Business \nRules in AMS As a rules-based system, AMS will assi st SARs in finding inconsistencies by \nflagging items as potentially problem atic, and determin ing whether the \nappraisal is in compliance with VA a ppraisal requirements, industry-accepted \nappraisal principles, and Uniform St andards of Professional Appraisal \nPractice (USPAP). \n \nc. Alerts \nProvided by AMS Alerts will be noted by the AMS base d on VA’s business rules.  All high \nalerts must be addressed in WebLGY notes.  Medium and low alerts do not \nrequire a comment, but should be carefu lly reviewed by the SAR.  Often the \nalerts will reflect an NOV conditi on that must be required, with no \nclarification needed from the appraiser. \n \nd. VA Guidance \non Specific \nAMS Scores VA will issue a circular periodically de scribing the AMS scores that will be \nconsidered low-risk and high-risk appr aisals.  SARs may perform a cursory \nreview on low-risk appraisals.  High-r isk appraisals require a comprehensive \nreview. Sometimes a score of “N/A” w ill be reported for complex, rural, or \nnew/proposed construction properties due to a lack of market data.  While this \nis not an indication of a high-risk appraisal, a comp rehensive review must be \nperformed since the AMS did not return  a score within the acceptable range \nfor a cursory review.   SARs must in dicate whether or not a cursory review \nwas performed in WebLGY with the indi cator on the screen where the NOV \nis issued. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 470 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-7 \n 4. Appraisal Management System , continued  \n \ne. Cursory \nReview of an Appraisal Cursory review requirements include: \n reviewing the sales comparison grid, \n confirming that the report contains  the required photographs (see \nChapter 11, Topic 3 of this Handbook)  which accurately reflect the \nappraiser’s description of the su bject and comparable properties, \n identifying all VA MPRs that must be addressed before the property \ncan become the security for a VA-guaranteed loan, \n reviewing any alerts identified by the AMS, documenting any high \nalerts in WebLGY notes, and \n identifying any additional conditions  that must be included on the \nNOV. \n \nf. Findings \nupon Cursory Review Findings in a cursory review may cause th e review process to be elevated to a \ncomprehensive review. \n \ng. Additional  \nRequirements for a \nComprehensive \nReview Comprehensive review requirements incl ude the requirements specified above \nfor a cursory review and: \n verifying that the appraisal report is fully completed, \n verifying that the appraisa l meets USPAP requirements, \n verifying that the appraisal complies with the Uniform Appraisal \nDataset (UAD) requirements, \n determining that the appraiser's methodology is appropr iate and that \nthe appraiser's conclusions are c onsistent, sound, suppor table, logical \nand based upon data in th e appraisal report, and  \n ensuring that the appraiser’s ma rket value estimate and other \nconclusions are consistent with those in similar cases recently \nprocessed. \n \nh. Systems Not \nin Operation If system issues arise and AMS results are not available, the SAR may \nperform a comprehensive review, noting in WebLGY that AMS results were not available.  If WebLGY is not available, the SAR may issue the NOV outside of WebLGY, entering the NOV in  WebLGY when the system is back \nonline.  A note should be entered do cumenting that this procedure was \nfollowed. \n \n\n--- PAGE 471 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-8 \n 5.

Energy Conservation Item 1a should be marked on NOVs for existing \nproperties (over 1-year old or  previously occupied) to \nallow lenders to increase th e loan amount for Veterans \nwishing to make energy efficiency improvements (see Chapter 7 of this Handbook).  Item 1b should be marked on NOVs for new or proposed construction excluding manufactured homes . For new and proposed \nmanufactured homes, energy efficiency is already \ncovered by the manufacturer’s  guidelines (see Chapter \n12, Topic 42 of this Handbook) so this item should not \nbe marked.   \n2.  Wood Destroying \nInsect Information If the property is located in  an area on the Termite \nInfestation Probability Map where the probability of termite infestation is \"ver y heavy\" or \"moderate to \nheavy,\" a wood destroying insect inspection report must be required on the No tice of Value (NOV).  Mark \n2a if the property is exis ting or new construction, or \nitem 2b if the property is proposed. For new construction, if a soil trea tment guarantee is provided, \nthis is preferable and will  satisfy condition 2a.  The \npest control operator must me et all state requirements. \nState-required inspectio n forms are acceptable.  \nInspection reports are valid for 90 days.  Soil treatment \nguarantees differ from an inspection and are \nconsequently valid well beyond 90 days.  A wood-destroying insect inspection is not required on units in \nlow-rise or high-rise condominiums (units are stacked vertically) unless the appraiser notes a potential infestation problem.  For s ite condominiums, and villa \nor townhome style condomin iums where units are not \nvertically stacked, an insp ection must be required on \nthe NOV unless evidence of a treatment guarantee has \nbeen provided b y the homeowners association.   \n  \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 476 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 13: Notices of Value \n \n13-13 \n 8.

Special assessments in cluding local authorities \ncollecting Community Deve lopment District (CDD) \nfees or other fees on th e HOA’s behalf should be \nreported here as well.  \n4. Condominium If the condominium is conditionally accepted by VA, \nthis item should be marked.  This item is not required \nif the condominium is fully accepted by VA.  If the \ncondominium has not been  accepted by VA, the NOV \nmust not be issued.  (See Ch apter 11, Topic 12 of this \nHandbook). \n5. Private Road/Shared Driveway If access to the property is by a private road or shared \ndriveway, this item shou ld be marked, unless the \nproperty is in a PUD or condominium with private \nstreets which are covere d by the organizational \ndocuments.  If a state law es tablishes requirements for \nthe maintenance of private ro ads, this condition is not \nneeded on the NOV.  \n6. Flood Insurance If the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard \nArea, this item must be marked. It is the lender's responsibility to ensure that flood insurance is obtained and maintained on properties located in \nSFHAs, whether or not the appraiser correctly identifies the property as being in an SFHA.  If flood insurance is not available, a property in a SFHA is not eli\ngible to be the securit y for a VA- guaranteed loan. \n7. Water/Sewage System Acceptability If the property has an individual water supply, such as \na well, this condition must be marked.  For proposed \nconstruction cases, acceptance of an individual sewage \nsystem must be required.  Acceptance of the sewage system is also require d for existing or new \nconstruction cases in which th ere is an indication of a \nproblem or the property is in an area known to have \nsoil percolation problems.

Repairs The repairs recommende d on the appraisal should be \nreviewed and only those wh ich are needed for the \nproperty to meet VA MPRs  should be listed on the \nNOV.  Any apparent defec tive conditions observed by \nthe appraiser must be addressed by requiring correction, rather than an inspection.  The completion \nof any repairs that could i nvolve lead-based paint must \nbe certified b y the fee appraiser. \n10. Post Construction \nInspection This condition must be marked on all proposed \nconstruction properties a nd properties appraised \nsubject to alterations such  as a room addition. \n11. New Construction \nInspections/Warranty For new construction properties, either 11a or 11b \nmust be required based on whether or not local \nbuilding inspections are performed.

Purpose of \nLAPP The purpose of the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) is to \nspeed up the time to loan closing by allowing VA-authorized lenders to \nreceive appraisal report s directly from appraise rs and process them \nwithout VA involvement. \n  \nb. How LAPP \nWorks There are basically four st eps in processing LAPP cases. \n \nStage Description \n1 The LAPP lender requests VA assignment of a fee appraiser \nand a VA loan number (same as a ny other case) and identifies \nthe case as “LAPP.” \n2 The VA-assigned appraiser sends the appraisal report directly \nto the LAPP lender’s VA-approve d staff appraisal reviewer \n(SAR). \n3 The LAPP lender’s SAR \n \n reviews the appraisal report fo r completeness and conformity \nwith industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques as \nwell as other VA requirements, \n determines the reasonable value of the property and any \nconditions which must be met prior to VA guaranty of the \nloan, and \n sends the veteran buyer a writ ten notice of the value which \nincludes any conditions or requirements upon which the VA \nloan guarant y is contin gent. \n4 The LAPP lender then underwrite s and closes the loan on the \nautomatic basis and requests VA guarant y. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 503 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-2 Overview, Continued \n  \nc.

Lender \nRequirements VA may grant Lender Appraisal Processi ng Program (LAPP) authority to any \nautomatic lender that requests it and meets the qualification criteria outlined in this chapter, includin\ng the Lender Qualit y Control S ystem Requirements. \n  \nb.  Role of Staff \nAppraisal Reviewer  The lender exercises its LAPP authority  through an employee who is a VA-\napproved staff appraisal reviewer (SAR).   \n  \nc.  SAR \nRequirements A lender’s staff appraisal SAR must: \n be a full-time salaried em ployee of the lender, and \n have at least 3 years of work experi ence which qualifies him or her to \ncompetently perform administrative appr aisals reviews in conjunction with \nunderwritin g loans for VA loan guarant y purposes. \n  \nd.  SAR’s Work \nExperience \nRequirements The SAR’s work experience must indicate that he or she has: \n general knowledge of the principles, methods, practices and techniques of \nappraising and the ability to apply that knowledge, \n the ability to review the work of others and recognize deviations from \naccepted appraisal principles and practices, \n the ability to detect errors in computations, and \n ability to detect conclusi ons which are not supported. \n  \nIt is also desirable for the SAR to have: \n knowledge of general realty practices a nd principles related to real property \nvaluation, \n skill in collecting and assembling data, and \n ability to prepare clear and concise reports. \n Note :  Three years of experience rela ted to the HUD Direct Endorsement \nprogram satisfies the experience requir ement provided all other application \nrequirements are satisfied. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 505 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-4 15.01  LAPP Eligibility, Continued \n  \ne.  Location of \nSAR There is no restriction on the location of a lender’s SAR. \n  \nf.  Geographic \nExtent of LAPP Once a SAR has satisfied the LAPP training and initial case review \nrequirements (SAR Training and Initial Case Reviews in this chapter), their LAPP authority may be used fo r properties in any state in which \nthe lender has authority to close loans under the auto matic procedure. \n If a lender’s automatic authority is extended into a ne w state, their \nSAR’s LAPP authority is immediately extended as well.  Note :  It is the SAR’s responsibility to stay informed about any local \nVA processing requirements unique to  the VA jurisdiction in which a \npropert\ny is located. \n \ng.  SAR \nConflicts of \nInterest There must not be a conflict of inte rest between the SAR’s role as SAR \nand any other activities that he or  she conducts.  Examples of other \nactivities which would be a conflict of interest include:  \n SAR is on the VA fee appraisal panel, or \n SAR is employed by or performs apprai sal review services for another \nlender. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 506 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-5 15.02 Lender Quality Control System Requirements \n  \nChange Date June 28, 2010, Change 14 \n This section has been updated to add subsection lettering, add hyperlinks, \nand to make minor grammatical edits. \n  \na.  Introduction To qualify for LAPP authority, the lende r must have an effective quality \ncontrol (QC) system which ensures th e adequacy and quality of its staff \nappraisal reviews.  This QC system mu st be independent of  the lender’s loan \nproduction operation.  Upon request, the lender must agree to furnish VA with findings and \ninformation about the system.  The seni or officer must certify on each SAR’s \nLender's Staff Appraisal Reviewer  Application (SAR) Application, VA Form \n26-0785 , that the QC s ystem meets the requirements detailed in this section. \n  \nb. QC \nReviewers Reviews of the SARs’ work may be pe rformed by an independent party or \nindependent internal audit division which reports directly to the lender’s chief \nexecutive officer.  QC personnel shou ld possess a basic familiarity with \nappraisal theory and techniques and th e ability to prescribe appropriate \ncorrective actions when problems in the appraisal review process are \nidentified. \n  \nc.  Frequency \nand Scope of Reviews Perform desk reviews of each SAR’s appraisal reviews on a routine basis \n(monthly or quarterly).  Th e sample size should be no less than 5 percent of \nthe SAR’s LAPP cases processed monthl y or a minimum nu mber of cases \n(for example, five cases).  There must be a procedure for expanding the scope of the reviews if a pattern \nof deficiencies is identified. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 507 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-6 15.02 Lender Quality Control System Requirements, \nContinued \n  \nd.  QC Review \nCriteria QC reviews should consider the: \n \n overall quality of the SAR’s appraisal review, \n acceptability of the property in light of VA minimum property \nrequirements, and \n appropriateness of the reasona ble value determination. \n  \ne.  Maintenance \nof VA Publications The QC system must provide assurance that all current pertinent VA \nregulations, directives, and other rele ases are maintained and immediately \navailable to the qualit y control personnel and SARs. \n  \nf.  Management \nNotification and Corrective Action The QC system must provide for written notification of deficiencies cited as a \nresult of audits or reviews at least qu arterly to the lender' s senior management \nor chief executive officer. \n \nThe QC system must require senior ma nagement to promp tly initiate and \ndocument actions to correct deficienci es and provide SARs with corrective \ninstructions. \n  \ng.  Review of \nVA Fee Panel \nAppraisals In addition to reviews of the SARs’ work, random field reviews of VA fee \npanel appraisals should be performe d.  These reviews can be done by the  \nSAR, or an independent appr aiser on a contract basis. \n \nNote : Formally report any substantive ne gative findings to  the VA Regional \nLoan Center where the appraiser is a member of the fee panel. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 508 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-7 15.03 Applying for LAPP Authority \n  \nChange Date June 28, 2010, Change 14 \n This section has been updated to add subsection lettering, add hyperlinks, \nand to make minor grammatical edits.  \n  \na.  Application \nand Fees Submit a separate Lender's Staff Ap praisal Reviewer Application (SAR) \nApplication, VA Form 26-0785 , and fee for each SAR approval request to the \nVA regional office with jurisdicti on over the SAR’s physical location. \n Legitimate requests to submit the application to a VA office more \nconveniently located for training and ot her interactions between the SAR and \nVA will be considered.  For each SAR approval request, incl ude a $100 processing fee plus the \ninformation, statements and certific ations exactly as  detailed on the \napplication, either on lender  letterhead or attached to a statement on lender \nletterhead which references it.  The same procedure applies to subs equent requests for VA approval of \nadditional SARs. \n  \nb.  Notification \nof VA Decision The VA regional office will review the application materials submitted and \nnotify the lender of its decisi on as quickly as possible. \n If VA determines that the SAR meets basic LAPP qualification requirements, \nit will inform the lender that the SAR must fulfill the SAR Training and Initial \nCase Review  requirements detailed  in this chapter. \n  \nc.  SAR ID \nNumber The notice from VA will provide a permanent ID number for each SAR \napproved.  The SAR always retains the sa me ID number, even if he or she \ngoes to work for another lender and is  approved as a SAR for that lender. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 509 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-8 15.04 SAR Training and Initial Case Reviews \n  \nChange Date June 28, 2010, Change 14 \n This section has been updated to add subsection lettering, add hyperlinks, \nand to make minor grammatical edits. \n  \na.  Training \nand Case Review \nRequirements The Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) may not begin performing appraisal \nreviews independently after VA’s notifi cation of approval until he or she \nfulfills VA training requirements and VA initial case review requirements.  \nGenerally, VA staff will train the SA R and then conduct the initial case \nreviews. \n  \nb.  Exceptions \nto Training and Case Review \nRequirements The following are the three exceptions to the SAR training and initial case \nreview requirements:  SAR Training During or After Case Reviews  \nThe lender may request that the training be conducted during or after the case \nreview requirement.  SAR With Prior LAPP Experience  \nThe lender may request a waiver of the training and case review requirements \nfor a SAR who previously satisfied those requirements while employed by \nanother LAPP lender, and has satisfactor ily processed LAPP cases within the \nlast year.  Experienced SAR to Train and Supervise New SAR  \nThe lender may request that one of its experienced SARs train and review the \ninitial cases of a new SAR.  The experienced SAR must:  \n \n have full LAPP authority a nd be performing acceptably, \n provide adequate training to the new SAR, and \n review and ensure the acceptabilit y of the new SAR’s initial LAPP cases. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 510 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-9 15.04 SAR Training and Initia l Case Reviews and Initial \nCase Reviews, Continued \n  \nc.  Training and \nCase Reviews \nCompleted by Experienced SAR Once the training and case reviews are acceptably completed, the lender’s \nsenior officer must se nd the VA office a signed and dated notice which \nincludes  \n the name and SAR ID number of bo th the trainee and trainer, and \n a letter stating that  \n the training covered all VA LAPP requirements, and \n the trainer reviewed at  least five cases succes sfully completed by the \ntrainee. \n \nNote :  The letter must include the VA case numbers for at le ast five cases. \n  \nd.  Training by \nVA Staff If the training and case review requ irements are not waived by VA or \ncompleted by an experienced SAR upon receipt of VA’s notification that the \nSAR meets the basic LAPP qualification requirements, the lender must call \nthat VA office to arrange for SAR tr aining.  VA will normally provide the \ntraining at the VA office (but  may provide it in meetings or seminars at other \nlocations in conjunction with schedule d VA field travel) and within 30 days. \n \nAt a minimum, the training by VA staff s hould consist of a 1 day session to \ndiscuss LAPP processing procedures a nd guidelines and any local VA office \nrequirements and conditions.  Note :  Due to the need for consistenc y between VA offices nationwide, each \noffice is expected to limi t local requirements and c onditions to only those that \nare essential. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 511 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nChapter 15: Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \n \n15-10 15.04 SAR Training and Initia l Case Reviews and Initial \nCase Reviews, Continued \n \ne.

SAR No \nLonger Employed or \nPerforming  \nSAR Work The lender must promptly notify VA if the Staff Appraisal Reviewer is no \nlonger employed or is no longer functioning as an SAR for the lender.  If either of these two apply, the SAR’s LAPP authority automatically ceases and the lender’s eligibility to participate in LAPP is terminated if that individual was the lender’s onl\ny SAR. \n  \nb.  SAR \nEmployed By New Lender If the SAR begins work for a new lender, that lender must promptly submit to \nVA a new VA Form 26-0785 , Lenders Staff Appraisal Reviewer Application, \nand $100 processing fee. \n The lender may request a waiver of the training and case review requirements \nfor that SAR by including a copy of VA’ s notice that the SAR has satisfied \nthose requirements and a statement th at the SAR processed LAPP cases and \nissued NOVs within the last \nyear. \n  \nc.

Due \nDiligence Lenders are expected to exercise due  diligence in processing LAPP cases and \nare responsible for complyi ng with all applicable:  \n \n VA policies and procedures, \n VA regulations, and  \n statutory requirements. \n VA considers due diligence to be care which is properly expected from, and \nordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent lender who is entirely \ndependent on the sub\nject propert y as a securit y to protect their investment. \n  \nb.  What LAPP \nLenders Can Expect In assuming the responsib ilities involved with proce ssing an appraisal under \nLAPP and subsequently underwriting the VA loan on the automatic basis, the \nlender has reasonable certain ty that the VA Form 26-1899,  Loan Guaranty \nCertificate , will be issued by VA, except in cas es of fraud or willful material \nmisrepresentation by the lender.

Contains provisions for the adoption of an annual operating budget and imposition and collection of \nassessments to meet the expenses of the association.  The board of directors has the power on behalf of the \nassociation to levy both annual and additional assessments.  \n a.  Units of a similar nature, receiving similar services , are assessed on a uniform basis except for the reduced \nassessment permitted for unoccupied units owned by the decl arant or a builder.  If a different basis is used \nwhich allocates assessment liability among unit based on diffe rent services provided to the units or the different \nnature of the units, the rationale for that basis must be fully explained. \n \nb.  If the declarant furnishes a multi-year feasibility b udget, the declarant and/or a builder may pay a reduced \nannual assessment on unoccupied lots only provided that  such reduced assessment is not less than 25% of the \nfull annual assessment.  Alternativel y, the declarant or builder may pay a one-time assessment equal to 25 \npercent of the applicable annual assessment per lot based upon the first year budget at maximum build-out (or 5 years out for projects involving 250 or more lots/units).   The lots for which the one-time assessment has been \npaid may be exempt from further assessment until the ear lier of: (i) initial occupancy or (ii) two fiscal years \nafter submission to the declaration.  If unoccupied units are receiving th e benefit of the reduced or one-time \nassessment, the documents provide that the declarant, or builder(s) as approp riate, must provide for or pay for \nall maintenance to such units and shall fund all operatin g budget deficits incurred during the declarant control \nperiod, including reserves based upon expected lives of items for which reserved, but not including shortfalls \ncaused by nonpayment of assessments by other members or extraordinary expenditures (e.g., expenses caused \nby natural catastrophes or environmental hazards).  A unit initially occupied or conveyed to a unit owner other than the declarant or a builder is fully  assessed.  The obligation to fund bu dget deficits is a lien against all the \nland owned by the declarant (or the declarant and builders) in the planned unit development. \n \nContinued on next page \nJanuary 1, 2001  16-B-18 \n\n--- PAGE 551 ---\n \nJanuary 1, 2001  16-B-19  VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  Section B:  Use of Attorney’s Opinion  \nExhibit A:  Other VA Requirements, Continued \n  \n(A) Declaration  (continued) \n \n10. If a maximum annual assessment is st ated, the maximum may increase auto matically by the greater of ten \npercent or based upon a Consumer Price Index, such as the U.S. Department of Urban Price Index - All Urban \nConsumers (1982-84=100) or other comparable index reflecting the association’s cost increase experience each \nyear.  The maximum may also be increased by a majority  vote of the members obligat ed to pay such assessment \nor with the written approval of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number  of authorized votes of \nmembers obligated to pay such assessment (in both cases  excluding the declarant du ring the declarant control \nperiod).  Increases in certain fixed costs for insurance, taxes, recycling or waste disposal may be passed through to the members, by permitting an automatic increase in the maximum assessment which reflects those increases.  \nIf no maximum assessment is set forth, a vote of the members must be required to approve capital expenditures, \nother than for repair and replacement, during a fiscal year of more than 20 percent of the budget for common expenses for that fiscal year. \n \n11. Contains provisions for a lien-supported assessment.  The assessment lien of any assessment levied by the \nassociation is subordinate to the lien of a first mortgage  (Title 38, USC, section 3703(d)(3)).  Subordination to \nother security interests or liens is acceptable if permitted by applicable law.  The sale  or transfer of any unit \npursuant to mortgage foreclosure of a first mortgage or any proceeding in lieu thereof extinguishes the lien of \nsuch assessments as to payments which became due prior to  such sale or transfer.  No  sale or transfer relieves \nsuch unit from liability for any assessments thereafter be coming due or from the lien thereof.  (NOTE: VA will \nnot recognize any limited priority that common expense a ssessments may have over the first mortgage lien.  \nMortgage holders should be aware that no VA claim pa yment will be made to holders for any payments they \nmay have made to clear prior liens for delinquent and unpaid association assessments). \n \nContinued on next page \nJanuary 1, 2001  16-B-19 \n\n--- PAGE 552 ---\n \n16-B-20  January 1, 2001 VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  Section B:  Use of Attorney’s Opinion  \nExhibit A:  Other VA Requirements, Continued \n  \n(A) Declaration  (continued) \n \n12.

The type and \nseverity of the sanction imposed is based on  \n the type of participant (for example,  lender, builder, ma nagement broker, \netc.), and \n the nature of the actions  (for example., fraud, signif icant deficiencies in \nperformance, ongoing disregard for VA requirements, and so on). \n \nSanctions may be imposed in the form of  \n civil money penalties, and/or \n the participant’s full or partial exclusion from participation in the VA loan  \nguaranty program for a certain period of time. \n \nAppeal Rights VA provides appeal rights to all progra m participants agai nst whom sanctions \nare imposed.  The notice informing the pa rticipant that sanctions will be or \nare imposed explains what the particip ant must do to appeal VA’s decision. \n \nIn this Chapter This chapter contains the followin g topics. \n \nTopic See Page \n17.01  Pro gram Participants 17-2 \n17.02  False Lender Certificatio n 17-6 \n17.03  Withdrawal of Automatic Authorit y 17-7 \n17.04  Withdrawal of LAPP Authorit y 17-11 \n17.05  Debarment and Suspensio n 17-15 \n17.06  Limited Denial of Participation (LDP) 17-18 \n17.07  Unfair Contract Provisions or Marketin g Practices 17-21 \n17.08  Violations of Equal Housin g Opportunit y Laws 17-23 \n  \n\n--- PAGE 563 ---\nChapter 17:  VA Sanctions Against Program Participants VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \n17-2   17.01  Program Participants \n \nProgram \nParticipants Any person or entity conducting busin ess related to the VA loan guaranty \nprogram is considered a progr am participant.

Purpose and Elig ibility Requirements \n \na. Purpose of \nSAPP Servicers of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  guaranteed loans may be \ngranted authority, under Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP), to \nreview liquidation appraisals, and issu e the Notice of Value (NOV) without \nVA involvement.  The servicer exer cises its SAPP authority through an \nemployee who is VA-approved as a SAPP Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR).  \nOnce a SAR has satisfied the SAPP training and initial case review \nrequirements (see section 3 of this chap ter), their SAPP authority may be used \nfor eligible properties (t hose secured by VA-guaranteed loans) in any location \nwithin the United States and its territories.  The purpose of SAPP is to reduce the time required for servicers of  VA loans to receive the NOV.  \n Important :  It is the SAR’s responsibility to  stay informed about any local \nVA processing requirements unique to  the VA jurisdiction in which a \nproperty is located. \n \nb. Servicer \nEligibility \nRequirements To be granted SAPP authority, the servicer must have:  \n \n a VA servicer identification number (ID), \n an association with a single le nder having a VA lender ID, and \n an effective quality cont rol (QC) system that ensures the adequacy and \nquality of its SARs.  (See s ection 6 of this chapter.) \n Note:   Under SAPP, a servicer may only have an associati on with a single \nlender. \n \nc. SAR \nEligibility \nRequirements The servicer exercises its SAPP author ity through an employee who is a VA-\napproved SAR.  A SAR must:  \n be a full-time salaried employ ee of the lender/servicer, and  \n have at least three years of work ex perience that qualifies him or her to \ncompetently perform administrative appraisal reviews. \nContinued on next pa ge \n\n--- PAGE 589 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n18-3 1. Purpose and Elig ibility Requirements, Continued \n  \nc. SAR \nEligibility \nRequirements (continued)  The SAR’s work experience must indicate that he or she has: \n \n general knowledge of the principles, methods, practices, and techniques of \nappraising and the ability to apply that knowledge, \n the ability to review the work of others and recognize deviations from \naccepted appraisal principles and practices, \n the ability to detect errors in computations, and \n the ability to detect conclu sions that are not supported. \n It is also desirable for the SAR to ha ve knowledge of general realty practices \nand principles related to real prope rty valuation, skill in collecting and \nassembling data, and the ability to prepare clear and concise reports.  \n Note :  Three years experience related to the Housing and Urban Development \n(HUD) Direct Endorsement (DE) pr ogram satisfies the experience \nrequirement, provide\nd all other application re quirements are satisfied. \n \nd. SAR \nConflicts of \nInterest There must be no conflict of interest between the SAR’s role and any other \nactivities that he or she conducts.  Examples of ot her activities that would \nconstitute a conflict of interest  include, but are not limited to: \n \n the SAR being on the VA fee appraisal panel, or \n the SAR being employed by or performi ng appraisal review  services for \nanother lender/servicer. \n  \n\n--- PAGE 590 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n \n18-4 2. Applying for Authority \n  \na. Application \nand Fees The nominating senior officer of the se rvicer and the nominee must jointly \ncomplete the Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) application.  SAR applicants must attach a resume showing they possess the three years requisite experience outlined in section 1 of this chapter. \n A $100 processin\ng fee must accompan y the application packa ge.   \n  \nb. Notification \nof VA Decision Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) Central Office will review the \napplication and send a letter of prelimin ary approval or rejection.  In some \ncases, VA will need to request additiona l information from both the nominee \nand the senior officer in orde r to make a determination. \n Receipt of a letter of preliminary ap proval will authorize the nominee to \nschedule Servicer Appraisal Processin\ng Program (SAPP) SAR trainin g.  \n  \nc. SAR ID \nNumber VA will issue a permanent identification (ID) number for each SAR \napproved.  The SAR always retains the same ID number, even when \nemployed by a different servicer.    When a SAR already has a Lender A ppraisal Processing Program (LAPP) \nSAR ID number, the number will al so be used as the SAPP SAR ID. \n \nd. SAR \nEmployed By New Servicer If a SAR begins work for a new se rvicer, the SAR’s SAPP authority \nautomatically ceases and does not transfer  to the new servicer.  To reinstate \nthe SAR’s SAPP authority, the new servicer employer must promptly submit to VA:  \n a new SAPP application, and \n a $100 processing fee. \n \nThe servicer may request a waiver  for the training and case review \nrequirements for that SAR by including:  \n the SAR’s VA-issued ID numbe r on the application, and  \n a statement that the SAR has processed SAPP cases within the last \nyear. \n \n\n--- PAGE 591 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n18-5 3. Training and Initial Test Case Reviews  \n  \na. Requirements Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SARs) w ith preliminary approval may not \nindependently review liquidation appr aisal reports and issue liquidation \nNotice of Values (NOVs), without th e involvement of Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA), until they recei ve final approval.  To obtain final \napproval, the SAR must complete the following:  \n attend Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SA R training, and  \n successfully complete five initial test  cases to demonstrate comprehension \nof VA liquidation appraisal review requirements to VA’ s satisfaction. \n VA Central Office staff will provide SAPP SAR training at the request of the \nservicer and VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) staff will conduct the initial \ntest case reviews.   \n \nb. Test Case \nProcedures Upon completion of SAR training, SARs  may begin submitting their test \ncases in The Appraisal System (TAS) for VA review.  Only one test case should be pending at any time; SARs should not submit an additional test case until the results of a previously submitted test case are known.  RLC \nstaff will notify the SAR about the re sults of the review.  The RLC staff \nperforming the review of test cases mu st complete the liquidation appraisal \nreview and issue the NOV within five workdays from the date the case is \nsubmitted by the SAR.    The following table outlines the steps for processing SAPP SAR test cases.  \nPlease note that these are the same steps for processing any SAPP cases, except for the requirement of VA involvement.  \nStep Description \n1 SAR accesses the VA E-Appraisal application in the Veterans \nInformation Portal (VIP or Portal ) and retrieves a SAPP appraisal.  \n(Only SAPP appraisals associat ed with the SAR’s company may \nbe retrieved.) \n2 SAR reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity \nwith industry-accepted appraisal pr actices and techniques, and for \ncompliance with applicable VA directives and general and \nliquidation appraisal requirements in chapter 11 . \n \nThe SAR must resolve any concerns  with the appraiser. (Report \nany contact with the appraiser and the results in “Processing \nNotes” when issuin g the NOV.) \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 592 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n \n18-6 3. Training and Initial Test Case Reviews, Continued \n \nb. Test Case Procedures  (continued)  \n  \nStep Description \n3 SAR determines the as-is value of the property, which must be \nsupported by the reviewed apprai sal report. (Make entries in \n“Processing Notes” to clarify or ju stify actions that are not self-\nexplanator y.) \n4 SAR accesses TAS in VIP, selects “Issue Liquidation NOV,” and \ninputs the required data to genera te an NOV.  (TAS will not allow \nSARs with preliminary approval to issue NOVs; they may only be \nsaved as NOV test cases awaiti ng review by the RLC.  (Upon \nreceipt of SAR final approval, TAS will allow issuance of the NOV without VA involvement.)  Note:  The SAR must notify the RLC of jurisdiction when a test \ncase has been submitted in TAS. \n5 VA RLC staff will review the fo llowing for all te st cases and a \npercentage of subsequent cases:  \n \n appraisal report, \n any related documents, \n the saved test case NOV, and  \n processing notes, for any contacts with the appraiser, processing \ndelays and clarification and/or ju stification of processing actions.  \n6 VA staff will issue the NOV.  The SAR will be notified of the \nresult(s) of the VA test case review and the SAR’s performance file will be documented. \n \nc. Continuing \nEducation by VA As needed, VA will notify SAPP SARs of supplemental training \nopportunities or additional training requirements.  \n \n\n--- PAGE 593 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n18-7 4. Servicer Responsibilities \n  \na. SAPP \nPrivilege Servicer Appraisal Processing Progra m (SAPP) authority is a privilege \ndelegated to servicers at VA’s discretion.  Servicers maintain this privilege by \ncomplying with all applicable SA PP-related requirements, including: \n \n Department of Veterans Affair s (VA) policies and procedures, \n VA regulations, and \n statutory requirements. \n \nFurthermore, servicers are expected to exercise due diligence in processing \nSAPP cases.  VA considers due diligence to be care that is properly expected \nfrom, and ordinarily exercised by, a reas onable and prudent servicer that is \nentirely dependent on the subject prop erty as a security to protect its \ninvestment.   If VA finds proper cause, the privilege extended to servicers under SAPP may \nbe:  \n amended, \n suspended, or \n withdrawn. \n \nReference:   For more information, refer to chapter 17 . \n \nb. Servicer and \nSAR Changes The servicer must notif y VA Central Office if: \n \n there is a change in owners hip, merger, or acquisition, or \n a SAR is no longer employed or is no longer functioning as a SAR for the \nservicer.  (In such cases, the SAR’s SAPP authority automatically ceases \nand the servicer’s eligibil ity to participate in SAPP is terminated if that \nindividual was the servicer’s onl y SAR on staff.)  \n \n\n--- PAGE 594 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n \n18-8 5. Processing Procedures \n \na. Property \nEligibility The subject property must be secured by a Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) guaranteed loan that is proceedin g toward liquidation. \n \nb. Appraisal \nRequest Servicers will request the appraisal in The Appraisal System (TAS) by \ncompleting VA Form 26-1805 , VA Request for Determination of Reasonable \nValue.  TAS will automatically notify the assigned appraiser via e-mail when \nthe liquidation appraisal assignment is made.   \n Servicers may authorize parties to orde r appraisals on their behalf (i.e., law \nfirms).  Those parties must register in  the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) \nunder their own name as an “Other Requestor.” \n \nNote:   When making the request, be sure  to provide accurate information on \nthe location of the keys to a vacant property in item 24 of VA Form 26-1805 , \nVA Request for Determination of Reasonabl e Value, as well as the telephone \nnumber of the party requesting the liquida tion appraisal in it em 40.  This may \nrequire additional instructions from servicers when referring cases to \nforeclosing attorneys, if the attorneys are the parties orde ring the liquidation \nappraisals.   If the agent… Then… \nis acting on behalf of an approved \nServicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) servicer and is authorized b\ny that servicer, he or she may request VA SAPP \nappraisals. \nrequests an appraisal, he or she must use his or her own \nlog-in identification (ID) to request appraisals.  An a ppraisal cannot be \nrequested unless the sponsoring servicer is known at the time of the request.  Note:  In requesting an appraisal, the \nauthorized agent is making the required certifications on behalf of the sponsorin\ng servicer. \nreceives notification the completed liquidation appraisal report has been uploaded in E-Appraisal, he or she must notify the sponsoring \nservicer or their Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) that the  appraisal was uploaded in E-Appraisal. \nContinued on next page \n\n--- PAGE 595 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n18-9 5. Processing Procedures, Continued  \n \nc. Access to \nProperty by \nAppraiser VA requires fee appraisers to gain access to vacant properties when \nperforming VA liquidation appraisals in or der to determine accurate values.  \nIf the fee appraiser is unable to gain  access to a vacant property, the appraiser \nshould use the contact inform ation provided in item 40 of VA Form 26-1805 , \nVA Request for Determination of Reas onable Value.  Servicers’ timely \nresponses to any telephone inquiries he lp to limit delays  in completion of \nappraisals for those cases where an appraiser encounters problems accessing the vacant property.  If the appraiser still cannot gain access,  he or she must document the actions \ntaken to obtain access to the subject vacant property in an e-mail to the \nConstruction & Valuation (C&V) section of jurisdiction.  C&V will then forward the appraiser’s email to the Regional Loan Center’s Loan \nAdministration Officer, who will forw ard it to the appropriate servicer \npersonnel.   \n Time delays caused by an appraiser’s inability to access a property can result in postponed liquidation sales.  Because such delays are beyond the control of \nthe appraiser, C&V “stops the cl ock” on the appraiser’s timeliness \nrequirements until access is obtained.  However, in most cases, VA does not view delays as beyond the c ontrol of the servicer, a nd therefore the servicer \nmay suffer curtailment of interest on th e loan if a sale cannot be completed \ntimel\ny due to dela ys in the appraiser obtainin g access to a propert y. \n \nd. Liquidation \nAppraisal Requirements For details about VA liquidation apprai sal requirements, see section 13 of \nchapter 11 . \n \ne. Submitting \nCases to VA for Processing If a SAR is reluctant to issue the Noti ce of Value (NOV) due to the difficulty \nor complexity of the case, the SAR may request that the VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of \njurisdiction issue the NOV.  \n  \n \n\n--- PAGE 596 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n \n18-10 6. Servicer Quality Control System Requirements \n  \na. Introduction To qualify for Servicer Appraisal Pro cessing Program (SAPP) authority, the \nservicer must have an effective quality  control (QC) system that ensures the \nadequacy and quality of its staff appraisa l reviews.  This QC system must be \nindependent of the servicer’s  loan servicing operation. \n Upon request, the servicer must agree to furnish Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) with findings and inform ation about the system.  The senior \nofficer must certify on each Staff Apprai sal Reviewer (SAR) application that \nthe QC s\nystem meets the requirements detailed in this section. \n  \nb. QC \nReviewers Reviews of the SAR’s work may be pe rformed by an independent party or \nindependent internal audit di vision that reports directly to the servicer’s chief \nexecutive officer.  QC personnel should possess:  \n a basic familiarity with apprai sal theory and techniques, and \n the ability to prescribe appropriate co rrective actions when  problems in the \nappraisal review process are identified. \n \nc. Frequency \nand Scope of \nReviews Perform desk reviews of each SAR’s a ppraisal reviews on a monthly basis.  \nThe sample size should be no less than:  \n five percent of the SAR’s SA PP cases processed monthly, or \n a minimum number of cases per mont h (for example, five cases). \n There must be a procedure for expanding the scope of the reviews if a pattern \nof deficiencies is identified. \n \nd. QC Review \nCriteria QC reviews should consider: \n \n the overall quality of the SA R’s appraisal review, and \n the appropriateness of the reasonable value determination. \n  \ne. Maintenance \nof VA Publications The QC system must provide assurance that all current VA regulations, \ndirectives, and other releases are mainta ined and immediately available to the \nQC personnel and SARs. \nContinued on next page \n  \n\n--- PAGE 597 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  \nChapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  \n18-11 6. Servicer Quality Control System Requirements, Continued \n  \nf. Management \nNotification \nand Corrective Action The QC system must provide for written notification of deficiencies cited as a \nresult of audits on quarterly reviews to:   \n the servicer’s senior management, or \n the chief executive officer. \n The QC system must requir e senior management to: \n \n promptly initiate and document actions to correct deficiencies, and \n provide SARs with corrective instructions. \n  \ng. Review of \nVA Fee Panel Appraisals In addition to reviews of the SAR’s work, random field reviews of VA fee \npanel appraisals should be performe d.  These reviews can be done by:  \n \n the SAR, or \n an independent appraise r on a contract basis. \n \nNote :  Any substantive negative findings should be formally reported to the \nVA Regional Loan Center (RLC) where th e appraiser is a member of the fee \npanel. \n \n\n--- PAGE 598 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nAppendix A: Listing of VA Offices \n \nAppendix A:  Listing of VA Offices \nOverview  \n  \nIn this chapter This appendix contains the following topics. \n \nTopic Topic Name See Page \n1 How to Use This Appendix A-2 \n2 Table of VA Offices  A-3 \n \n \nA-1 \n\n--- PAGE 599 ---\nVA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised \nAppendix: Listing of VA Offices  \n \n1.

Special \nProcedures \nfor Veterans  \nRated \n“Unable to Manage VA Benefits”  Prior  to an RLC  approving a VA home loan application submitted by a lender \nfor a beneficiary in the fiduciary program, an assessment must be conducted by the Fiduciary Hub to determine if the investment is prudent and in the best interest of the beneficiary.  T his assessment is required even when the spouse \nis the payee.   \n To initiate the determination process, complete and email a copy of the Fiduciary Hub Memorandum (see Topic 8 of this chapter  for a sample \nmemorandum) to the Fiduciary Hub with jurisdiction ( see Topic 9 of this \nchapter ). \n The Fiduciary Hub will return the memorandum wit hin 3- business days of \nreceipt and the memorandum will be marked “Approved,” “Denied,” or “Field Examination Required.”  Please note that the Fiduciary Hub is not making an unde rwriting decision (whether the loan should be approved or \ndenied).  \n If the memorandum is marked “Approved,” proceed with underwriting.  If the memorandum is marked “Denied,” inform the lender VA cannot approve the loan.  If the memorandum is marked “Field Examination Required,” inform the lender it may take as long as 120 -calendar  days for the Fiduciary Hub to make \na determination.  \n \nReal estate must be titled only in the beneficiary’s name.  Listing the fiduciary’s name on the title with the beneficiary is strictly prohibited, unless the fiduciary is a spouse payee.  There are circumstances where an individual besides a spouse may be listed on a real estate title with the beneficiary; however, these instances require review and approval by Central Office, Pension and Fiduciary Service.  The Fiduciary Hub or Activity conducting the \nassessment must submit a request to Central Office, Pension and Fiduciary Service, for instances where another individual, besides a spouse, will be \nlisted on the title with the ben eficiary.  \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\n  M26-1, Revised\n  Chapter 2:  Credit Underwriting  \n2-7 \n 2.

Special \nProcedures \nfor Secondary Borrowing  If the VA -guaranteed first mortgage is submitted for prior approval:  \n• Review the documentation on the second mortgage for acceptability \nof the terms of that mortgage  (see Chapter 9 , Topic  4 of the  \nVA Lender’s Handbook ). \n• Include the second mortgage payment in the income and debt evaluation.  \n• Contact the lende r, if the  loan approval is marginal due to the second \nmortgage payment.   \n• Suggest modification of the terms of the second mortgage.  \n \nRequire the lender to obtain first lien position when recording the VA  \nmortgage .    \n  \ne. Notif ication  \nof Withdrawal \nor Rejection  If the lender or Veteran wishes to withdraw the application , then advise the \nlender to cancel the request in the electronic system of record . \n If the l oan s pecialist reviews the loan and recommends rejection:  \n• The Loan Production Officer (LPO) or appropriate level individual will \npersonally review the file and document the decision in the electronic \nsystem of record , then  \n• Notify the lender and borrower  in writing and telephone , and then \ndocument it in the electronic system of record . \n  \nf. Verify \nGuaranty for Joint Loans  For joint loans involving one or more non -Veterans:  \n• Limit the loan amount shown on the commitment to the \nVeteran's/Servicemember’s portion of the loan.  \n• Base the percentage of guaranty on the ratio of the amount of entitlement the Veteran has available to the Veteran's portion of the loan. (See chapter \n7, Topic 2 of the VA Lender’s Handbook\n).   \n• Calcu late the appropriate funding fee  (FF)  amount based on Vete ran’s \nportion of the loan (see C hapter 7, Topic 2 of the VA Lender’s \nHandbook ).   \n Continued on the next page  \n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\nM26-1, Revised                                                                                                                      \nChapter 2:  Credit Underwriting    \n2-8 \n 2.

See Chapter  5, Topic 4( e) of \nthe VA Lender ’s Handbook\n. \n \nChanges to the intended loan obligation  \n \nSee Chapter 5 , Topic 4 (f) of the VA Lender’s Handbook . \n  \nh. Cancel \nCertain Commitments \nOutstanding 6 \nMonths or Longer  Ensure timely cancellation of expired C ertificates of Commitment, t aking into \nconsideration the 60- calendar days allowed for reporting loans.  \n \nThe electronic system of record  tracks Certificates of Commitment \noutstanding for 6 months or longer.  \n \nReview each commitment file over 6 -months old and determine if  the \ncommitment should be canceled based on the following review :  \n• The validity period of the commitment has expired. \n• There is no request for extension of the validity period from the lender . \n• The FF  has been paid;  contact the lender for status  of the closing package.  \n• If FF has not been paid, contact the lender to verify the status before \ncanceling the commitment.  \n• Notify the lender of actions taken and annotate actions in  the electronic \nrecord . \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 31 ---\n  M26-1, Revised\n  Chapter 2:  Credit Underwriting  \n2-9 \n 2.

Approve or \nReject Loan  Determine the Veteran's willingness a nd abi lity to make the loan payments. \nThe default on the prior loan is not a basis for withholding approval of the \nnew loan in the absence of a clear indication that the Veteran lacks the willingness or abi lity to make the loan payments. However , do not approve a \nloan that would be of no real benefit to the interests of the Veteran or the Government.  \n All late payments and late charges c an be rolled into the new loan. If the \namount of late payments and late charges is significant, the proposed monthly paym ent will be adversely impacted. Carefully analyze whether the I nterest \nRate R eduction R efinance Loan (IRRRL)  would benefit the Veteran and not \ncreate unacceptable risk to the Government in light of the new monthly payment.  \nCommunicate  the decision to the lender  and a nnotate  the decision in the  \nelectronic system of record . \n  \n\n--- PAGE 34 ---\nM26-1, Revised                                                                                                                      \nChapter 2:  Credit Underwriting    \n2-12 \n 4.

Release of \nLiability  VA processes Release of Liabilities (ROL s) for three purposes:  \n• For servicers without automatic authority when their holders lack \nautomatic authority , \n• Divorce cases where the Veteran is retaining the property , and  \n• Special approvals  and appeals . \n Reference Chapter 5 , Topic 7 of the VA Lender’s Handbook\n for additional \ninformation relating to ROLs and Substitutions of Entitlement (SOE s). \n  \nb. Servicers \nWithout Automatic Authority  Servicers without automatic authority , and whose holders lack automatic \nauthority , will develop and submit a complete credit package to VA .  VA will \nthen act as the approving entity.  The process is similar to underwriting and making a decision on a prior a pproval loan.  \n• When a request is received, create a record in the RLC  tracking system.  \n• In order to process a release,  you must have the following information:  \n• VA Form 26 -6381 , Application for Assumption Approval/Release \nfrom Personal Liability .   \n• VA Form 26 -6382 , Statement of Purchaser or Owner Assuming \nSeller’s Loan.  \n• A three file merged credit report pulled by the loan servicer.  \n• VA Form 26 -6807 , Financial Statement , completed by the prospective \nassumer.   \n• VA Form 26 -8497 , Request for Verification of Employment , or \ntelephonic VOE properly completed by the loan servicer . \n• Original pay stubs, L eave & E arnings S tatement , W-2s, or tax returns \nfor the prior 2 years , if self -employed , or other doc umentation as \nstated by Chapter 4 of the  VA Lender’s Handbook .  \n• Retirement statements, 1099Rs, or other verification of income, if \nappropriate . \n• Leases, if appropriate.  \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 36 ---\nM26-1, Revised                                                                                                                      \nChapter 2:  Credit Underwriting    \n2-14 \n 5.

If the second hold date \npasses without a response from the servicer, withdraw the request and \nannotate the electronic system of record  and notify the servicer, Veteran , and \nassumer that the request has been withdrawn . \n When all documents are received, close out the record in the  RLC ’s electronic \nrecord.  Send RLC -generated letters to the parties involved advising that the \nrelease has been compl eted, etc.   \n If an SOE is appropriate, then send the RLC -generated letter for SOE \nadvising both Veterans of the restoration and usage of entitlement.  Notate changes in the nationwide electronic loan record.  \n If the request has been withdrawn, then close out your RLC ’s electronic \nrecord and notate such in the nationwide electronic loan record.  \n \nWhen a judge awards property encumbered by a VA loan to a spouse , then \nthe loan servicer will process the ROL  for the Veteran.

Release of Liability , Continued \n  \nb. Servicers \nWithout \nAutomatic Authority, \ncontinued When a judge awards property encumbered by a VA loan to the Veteran whose \nentitlement is associated with the loan, then VA will process the release of the \nnon-retaining spouse or joint obligor .   Procedures for joint loans, for both \nVeteran/ Veteran or V eteran/non -Veteran, are described above.  \n   \nc. Divorce \nCases  \n When sole ownership is involved (i.e. Veteran and spouse), then the Veteran \nis liable to VA under both subrogation and indemnity.  The spouse is liable only if the spouse signed the Note.  The Veteran is using his benefit creating the subrogation, plus the  Veteran has signed the Note creating indemnity.  \nDue to the strength of VA’s stance regarding the Veteran’s obligation, we will routinely release the spouse from liability providing the following documentation is provided:   \n• A devise of law (i.e. divorce decree or other document accepted by the \nstate in which the divorce occurs) duly executed that provides the \nimpetus for the release request.   \n• A copy of the legal document that provides for the settlement of \nproperty.  \n• A copy of a recorded legal instrument, which transfers title from the former spouse to the Veteran.  This does not need to include the \nassumption language because of the strength of VA’s position regarding the Veteran’s liability.  \n• Evidence that the subject loan is current at the time of the re lease or at \nthe time the request was made.  \n• Written request for release from the former spouse.  This information \nmust be collected  on VA Form 26 -6381\n.  \n \nNo FF is assessed in divorce cases.  Once th e servicer is informed that VA \nhas approved the ROL , they may charge a nominal fee up to $50.00 to amend \ntheir records to reflect the change in ownership.  \n Review the documents received.   \n• If all documents are received, complete and satisfy the requirements \nthen notate your RLC s electronic system of record  as to the \ncompletion of the release.   \n Continued on the next page  \n \n    \n \n\n--- PAGE 40 ---\nM26-1, Revised                                                                                                                      \nChapter 2:  Credit Underwriting    \n2-18 \n 5.

Hold  the response for 30 -calendar days.  If the hold date passes \nwithout a response, withdraw the request, annotate the electronic system of record , and notify the Veteran  and ex -spouse that the request has been \nwithdrawn.  \nd. Servicer \nProcessed Releases  VA loan servicers process most requests for ROLs  and all transfers of \nownership.  The servicer is required to report these events in the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) system , as well as , report the ROLs  \nin the FFPS as either a payment or exemption of the fee.  \n A monthly record of servicer processed releases is available through the VALERI system.  Servicers must provide a copy of their ROL file, including all underwriting and closing documents as described in Chapters 4 and 5 of the VA Lender ’s Handbook\n, within  30-calendar days of closing the \nassumption.  RLC s should request copies of these release packages  if they \nhave not received them within 90- calendar  days of the event reported in \nVALERI.  \n \nRLC s may also use the reports available in FFPS to request these files.  In this \ncase, RLC s may request the assumption event be first reported to VALERI, \nthen follow normal RLC  follow -up procedures.  \n Continued on next page  \n \n  \n \n    \n\n--- PAGE 41 ---\n  M26-1, Revised\n  Chapter 2:  Credit Underwriting  \n2-19 \n  \n5. Release of Liability , Continued \n  \nd. Servicer \nProcessed \nReleases, \ncontinued \n When a servicer -processed ROL is received , the file must be reviewed to \ndetermine if a n SOE has been requested.   \n• If an SOE is appropriate, check for the assumer’s available entitlement \nand ensure the o ccupancy requirement is met.  \n• If the assumer does not have sufficient entitlement, suspend the file \nand request the appropriate information/documentation from the \nassumer.   \n \nComplete a cursory review of the underwriting and ensure the following:  \n• Appropriate charges (see Chapter 5, Topic 7 of the  VA Lender’s \nHandbook  for allowable charges),  \n • Receipt of the FF or creation of an exempt record , \n• Proper assumption language on legal instruments , \n• The loan is current at the time of the assumption closing , and  \n• Mailing addresses for the Veteran and the assumer . \n \nIf the review reveals the need for  additional information;  suspend the file, \nhold for 30 -calendar days, and send RLC -generated letters to the parties \nrequesting the additional documentation.  Otherwise, code appropriately in the system of record .  Notate your RLC ’s electronic tracking system  with the \nstatus.   \n  \ne. Graduated \nPayment Mortgages (GPM)  If an ROL  or SOE  case involves a GPM and the assumption will take pla ce \nduring the graduation period; obtain from the assumer the signed statement described in Chapter 7, Topic 7( h) of the  VA \nLender's Handbook , modi fied to \nreflect the payment informatio n as of the year of assumption.  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 42 ---\nM26-1, Revised                                                                                                                      \nChapter 2:  Credit Underwriting    \n2-20 \n 6.

VA will process the SOE, generally after the holder has provided notice of an \napproved transfer.  \nFor loans with com mitments made before March 1, 1988, VA will \nprocess any ROLs:  \n• If title was previously transferred and a n ROL was not \nobtained, the Veteran buyer's qualification from a credit \nstandpoint will be determined as of the date of application for \nsubstitution, not when title transferred.  \n• If an ROL was previously granted, the Veteran buyer is \npresumed to qualify from a credit standpoint, as long as, the \nloan is current at the time of application.  \n \n  \na.

Determine whether all \nrequirements for ROL /SOE  are met, including whether \nthe buyer (s) meet credit and income standards, if \napplicable.  If standards are met, proceed to step 4.  If  not, \nskip to step  7. \n4 Advise the seller by letter that the application has been \napproved (and the sal e may be closed, if applicable). \nInclude that substitution will not be effected until a copy \nof the assumption clause (or in some states, and when title  \nhas already been transferred, a properly signed \"Agreement Creating Liability to Holder and to the United States\") has been received by VA, and a \ndetermination is made that the loan is current.  \n5 Once the SOE is coded, send a new C OE to the buyer \n(and seller , if a 26 -1880 was received) showing the SOE \nas done.

No substitution can be done, and Cheryl cannot have her entitlement res tored until the loan is paid- in-full or another eligible \nVeteran assumes the loan and substitutes $36,000 entitlement. \n \n Example 2 : Joe purchased a property from Cheryl, and assumed the VA loan.  \nCheryl had originally used $36,000 of her entitlement to purchase the home.  Joe wishes to substitute his entitlement for Cheryl's, and he has $36,000 available entitlement.  The substitution can be done and Cheryl can have her entitlement restored.  \n \nExample 3: Joe and Cheryl purchased a property together  using joint \nentitlement.  Each originally used $36,000 of entitlem ent.  Joe wishes to \nsubstitute his entitlement for Cheryl's to release her from the loan.  Joe has enough bonus entitlement to substitute for Cheryl’s, so she can have her \nentitlement restored.  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 46 ---\nM26 -1, Revised   September  XX, 2015  \nChange 5   \n \n2-24 \n 7.

VA Funding \nFee In order to defray the cost of administering a VA home loan, each Veteran, \nexcept those with exemption status, must pay a funding fee to VA at loan \nclosing.  \n Funding fee rates can be found in Title 38 U .S.C. §3729\n. \n \nLenders must pay the funding fee electronically , through the VA Funding Fee \nPayment System (FFPS), at the following webs ite www.ffps.vba.va.gov . \n  \nb. Determining \nExemption \nStatus  Certificates of Eligibility (COE) issued after September 11, 2011, reflect the \nVeteran’s exemption status.   \n \nIf the COE does not reflect the correct exem ption status, advise the lender to \nsubmit VA Form 26 -8937 , Verification of VA Benefits , for processing.  \n  \nc. Funding Fee \nRefunds   When a Veteran or lender requests a refund of all, or a portion, of a funding \nfee, determine whether a refund is due, the amount to be refunded, and the \nparty to whom it should be refunded.  \n All refund requests must be reviewed and a decision made within 10- business \ndays of the initial request  date.  In the event the Veteran or lender has not \nprovided all the necessary information for a determination, the system of record must be fully documented.   \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 53 ---\nM26-1, Revised    \nChapter 3:  Fees and Charges Pai d by the Borrower  \n \n \n3-4 \n 2.

Selection \nCriteria  Conduct a file review on cases selected by the electronic system at the volume \ndetermined by Central Office (CO).  \n \nReview  Selection Criteria  \n In addition to the random system -selection , the system will automatically \nselect closed loans for which:  \n \n• The Veteran's residual income is below the standard by more\n than 10 \npercent; or  \n• The Veteran's debt -to-income ratio is  45 percent or greater and the residual \nincome does not exceed the VA standard by at least  20 percent; or  \n• Loans guaranteed more than 60- calendar  days after closing.  \n \nIn addition to the system selected cases, R egional Loan C enter s (RLCs) may \nidentify specific lenders whose loan submissions are frequently of such poor quality that a file  review (standard or special) is necessary.  \n A standard file review must be performed on loans submitted during the 1- year \nprobationary period of a non-supervised lender granted automatic authority by \nVA, selected as follows:  \n \n• The first 15 loans closed automatically by the lender, and  \n• 50 percent of the next 50 loans. \n \nThereafter, cases will be selected as with any other lender.  \n EPDs are performed to identify credit underwriting deficiencies by reviewing newly closed loans where six or fewer payments have been made and the loan has gone into default.  All EPDs must be fully reviewed to verify whether the lender approved a possibly egregious loan.  \n The only exceptions for EPD reviews  are cases in which:  \n \n• A  standard file review was previously completed with a close -out date \nin WebLGY , or \n• A VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) system update \nerror occurred.  \n \nRLCs must place detailed comments in the notes section of the loan number \nwithin WebLGY.  \n Continued on next page   \n\n--- PAGE 73 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-4 \n 1. Conduct a Review After Guaranty  Is Issued , Continued  \n  \nc. Selection \nCriteria , \ncontinued  CD file reviews ar e performed  in accordance with 38 CFR 36.4313(d)(1), to \nensure that Veterans only pay, or are charged, certain specific fees. Many of these \nfees are third party fees, i.e., collected from the Veteran by the lender on behalf of \nother parties to the transaction.  The com plete list of these fees may be found in our \nregulations, at 38 CFR 36.4313 . \n \nUpon completion of a CD review, the RLC may  determine that the review be \nescalated to a standard review.   RLC management will follow the guidance in CD \nUser Instructions to internally escalate the special CD review to a standard file \nreview.  \n  \nd. How to \nConduct a File \nReview  Follow these steps on each loan selected for a file  review:  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 Verify all required documents have been submitted in the proper \norder to WebLGY.  Chapter 5 , Topic 3 of the VA Lender's \nHandbook  provides lists of documents required for different types \nof loan submissions.    \n2 If the lender’s submission is incomplete or not in the proper \nstacking order, process the file as an improper submission error in \nFFLR.  \n3 Review the loan file f ollowing the file review process. For more \ndetail ed instructions of  the review process , please refer to \nthe FFLR User Instructions  and/or CD User Instructions . \n4 For prior -approval loans, determine whether the closed loan is \nidentical to the proposed loan on which the Certificate of Commitment was based. If not, determine whether the variations are allowable per Chapter 5 , Topic 4 of the VA \nLender’s \nHandbook . \n5 For prior -approval loans on which a conditional Certificate of \nCommitment was issued, determine whether all required conditions or certifications have been satisfied or provided. \nSee Chapter 5 , Topic 4  of the VA Lender’s Handbook . \n \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 74 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-5 \n 2. Review Findings  \n  \nChange Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  \n• This section has been updated in its entirety . \n  \na. What are \nPossible Review Findings?  Upon completion of the file review, the Loan Specialist will have one of the \nfollowing determinations: \n• No negative findings/deficiencies  \n• Ineligible Loan,  \n• Deficiencies, and/ or \n• Egregious Loan Referral.  \n \nCO tracks the determinations  listed above and will make any necessary referrals \nto the Monitoring Unit for a possible audit of the lender.  \n  \nb. What to do \nwith an Ineligible Loan  Pursuant to  38 CFR 36.4328 (a) and 38 U .S.C. 3721 , any evidence of guaranty \nor insurance issued by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guaranty or insurance .  Once the funding fee is paid, \nthe loan is considered a VA -guaranteed loan.  The only exceptions are:  \n• An ineligible Veteran.  \n• An ineligible loan purpose. \n• Fraud or material misrepresentation.  \n \nThe loan  guaranty shall never be cancel ed for the following reasons:  \n• The lender cannot sell the loan to an investor or the secondary market.  \n• The lender has failed to respond to non- compliant letters.  If the loan is \nineligible based upon the noted deficiencies, then the loan guaranty shall \nbe canceled.  However, if it is not an ineligible loan, then the loan must be sent through CO Front Office  for an egregious loan review  for \npossible indemnification . \n• The lender does not want the loan insured.  \n \nExample s of Ineligible Loans : The Veteran is  ineligible for the home loan \nbenefit ; the Veteran intends to use the loan to purchase a business property;  an \nInterest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan  proceeds are used to pay \nanother/subordina te lien; maximum loan amount is exce eded;  Notice of Value \n(NOV) conditions affecting the basic livability of the property cannot be satisfied; the escap e clause is not in  the contract;  the loan has a term which \nexceeds the remaining economic life of the property , or 30 years and 32 days.  \n Continued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 75 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-6 \n 2.

What to do \nwith an \nIneligible Loan, \ncontinued\n Consult CO Loan Policy if some doubt exists as to whether the loan is eligible \nfor guaranty through an email to the Loan Policy mailbox \n(LoanPolicy.VBAVACO@va.gov ).  Contact the lender by mail and telepho ne \nto try to resolve the problem.  Place detailed notes from the telephone contact in the loan records, within WebLGY , and the lender’s record within the \nStakeholder Information Management system (SIM) . Include  the name, title , \nand telephone number of the person contacted.  \n Follow th ese steps with ineligible loans  when the lender cannot , or fails to , \ncorrect the problem within 30- calendar days:  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 Send the lender the letter in Topic 7 of this chapter, stating clearly \nthat the loan is not guaranteed, VA will not pay any subsequent claim on the loan, and that  the lender should not foreclose the loan \nbecause of denial of guaranty and that such action could subject the lender to VA sanctions, signed by the L oan P roduction O fficer \n(LPO) . \n2 Refund th e VA funding fee, if paid (see “Refunding \nOverpayments to the Veteran” in Chapter 8, Topic 8(j) of the \nVA Lender’s Handbook ). \n3 Restore the Veteran’s entitlement for the loan following the steps \nin M26 -1, Chapter 7, Topic 10.  \n4 The LPO or A ssistant Loan Production Officer (ALPO)  must code \nthe loan as a canceled loan in the VA system of record and provide a thorough explanation in the notes section of the loan, within WebLGY.  Additionally, documentation from the lender must be \nuploaded into the correspondence section of the loan file. \n5 Send the Veteran a letter explaining why he or she does not have a \nVA-guaranteed loan and upload a copy of the letter into the loan \nfile.  The RLC must use the letter in Topic 6 of this chapter and \nthe letter must be signed by the LPO.  \n \nOnce the guaranty is canceled, the ineligible loan is n o longer a VA -guaranteed \nloan.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 76 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-7 \n 2.

Take \ncare not to alert the parties responsible for the possible fraud or misrepresentation that they are under investigation.  \n• If, after receipt of any additional information requested, it appears that fraud \nor material misrepresentation may have occurred, forward a detailed request \nfor investigation to IG.  \n Deficiencies Found through the FFLR Process  \n \n• Request any supplementary information or documentation that is essential to \na proper determination as to:  \n• Whether the loan meets statutory credit and /or income requirements, \n• Whether only allowable closing costs were charged to the Veteran, or  \n• Whether other statutory or regulatory requirements were met.   \n \nIf these efforts fail to resolve the problem(s) after 60- calendar days  from the \ninitial file review  complete date , review for non -compliance . \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 77 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-8 \n 2.

How to \nHandle Non -\nCompliant Lenders  The Loan Specialist must  send the system generated  non-compliant letter that is \ncreated in WebLGY, for this purpose. The letter must be sent if the lender has not responded to the second deficiency letter.  If no lender response to the non-compliant letter  the LPO/ALPO must send the letter for persi stent non-\ncompliance, in Topic 5, to the lender’s senior level management 30-  to 60-\ncalendar days after the non- compliant letter . \n \nNote: Non -compliance for not receiving the loan file for review will be handled \nby CO.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 78 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-9 \n 2. Review Findings , Continued  \n  \ne. What to do \nwith Egregious Findings\n If, after all attempts have been made to obtain additional documentation as \nnoted above  or the documentation provided does not resolve the issue , the \nlender has still not resolved the significant deficiencies regarding income and/or credit, determine whether the deficiencies are serious enough to consider the loan egregious .  To be egregious , you must determine that the lender flagrantly \ndisregarded VA ’s credit underwriting standards.  For example, the lender used \nincome, but did not provide any docume ntation to support that income, or the \nlender considered the Veteran a good credit risk when the credit report clearly showed that the credit accounts were derogatory.    \n When deficiencies are not specific to egregious underwriting or an ineligible loan, and the lender fails to cure the deficiencies, the RLC will follow the steps listed in Topic 2(d) of this chapter.  Examples of items that are not egregious, include , but are not limited to , NOV items that do not affect the eligibility of \nthe loan .  \n After determining that the loan should be considered as an egregious loan, forward the case to the LPO , ALPO , or higher authority for a second review.  If \nthe LPO, ALPO , or higher authority is in agreement that the loan is egregious, \nfollow the steps indicated below:  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 Ensure that all support ing documentation of the review  and \nresponse (s) by the lender are uploaded into the correspondence \nsection of the loan in WebLGY.  \n2 Draft a memo to the Director of Loan Guaranty Service, signed by \nthe RLC Loan Guaranty Officer that  provides justification for the \nreferred egre gious loan.  \n3 Email the signed memo to the main LGY mailbox \n(LGY.VBACO@va.gov ) with “ Potential Egregious Loan” in the \nsubject line. \n  \nCO will make a determination whether indemnification is warranted, and \nprovide a  written response  to be sent to the RLC  within 60- calendar days .  In \nthe event the loan is determined to be egregious, CO will flag WebLGY  and \nsend a memo with the indemnification agreement to the RLC .  The RLC must \nsend a letter and the two indemnification agreements to the lender, for signature.  Copies of a s ample letter and an indemnification agreement are in \nTopics 8 and 9. \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 79 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-10 \n 2.

General \nCredit Report Requirements  RLCs may contract with a credit reporting agency , or with ag encies, to obtain \ncredit  reports.  \n Generally, \"in -file\" credit report(s) obtained through this method will satisfy \nmost RLC  objectives.  An “in -file” credit report is computer -generated and \ncontains credit and legal information from one of the main credit bureaus.  \n In certain cases, a full credit report will be needed.  The credi t report must be \nordered using procedures  that the LPO has established based upon the contract \nthat RLC has in place . \n \nCosts of establishing and maintaining any such service must be paid for out of \nRLC funds.  \n  \nb. Uses for the \nCredit Reports Obtained  Uses for the  credit reports may include:  \n• Review of questionable original credit report used by the lender  (potentially \negregious loan and/or EPD ). \n• Credit underwriting on release of liability and substitution  of entitlement \nrequests.  \n• Additional  scrutiny of questionable prior -approval applications. \n• Native American Direct loans.  \n \nDo not use the in- file credit report as a sole basis for rejection -  clarify \ninconsistencies with the lender.  \n  \nc. Safeguard \nthe Interests of Applicants  Obtain a written agreement with the credit -reporting agency that it will comply \nwith the Fair Credit Reporting Act .  The Act contains provisions which ensure a \nconsumer has access to their credit information and the right to dispute any such information. \n \nRefer applicant complaints of  Fair Credit Reporting Act violations by credit \nreporting agencies to the Federal Trad e Commission.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 81 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-12 \n 3.

Fa ilure, either one -time or on a repetitive basis, to show that loans meet VA \nrequirements could result in any of the following:  \n \n• VA may suspend random sampling reviews and require that all loans closed by a le nder be \nsubmitted to VA for full review.  \n• VA may suspend a lender’s automatic authority and require that all loans be submitted on the \nprior -approval basis.  \n• VA may impose other administrative sanctions.  \n \nIf you have any questions, please contact insert  name , Loan Production Officer, at \ninsert phone \nnumber  or insert name , Assistant Loan Production Officer, at  \nInsert phone number . \n Sincerely,  \n   Loan Guaranty  Officer  \n \n  \n    \n\n--- PAGE 89 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 4:  Events After Guaranty  \n \n4-20 \n 8.

All VA requirements for se rvicing and payment of loan fees will be observed in respect to such \nmortgage.  In the event of a claim under guaranty from a transferee of a mortgage covered by this Agreement, \nindemnification will be in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c), whichever app lies. \n \n (b) Where a VA guaranty claim is pending or has been paid in full and the property is owned by VA, conveyance \nof the property will be accepted by Movement Lender and indemnification will be made to VA for its \ninvestment.

Provide \nParticipant s \nthe \nOpportunity to Avoid Sanctions  Notify the participant in writing that sanctions are being considered and provide \nthe opportunity to correct problems where possible. \n Does not  apply to cases involving fraud or criminal activity.  \n Example : Builder Construction Deficiency. (See M26- 2\n). \n• A Veteran reports that after the RLC  notified the builder of a construction \ndeficiency complaint, the builder did not correct the problem or refuses to \ncooperate.  \n• If the facts warrant, based on a field review of the property, notify the \nbuilder in writing that sanctions are being considered. Include the builder's \noption to submit documentati on or visit the RLC  to dispute the complaint. \n• If the builder fails to successfully dispute the complaint or correct the \ndeficiencies determined by VA to be the builder's responsibility after \nreasonable opportunity, advise the builder by registered or certi fied mail \nthat, unless satisfactory arrangements are made with the RLC  by a specific \ndate, sanctions will be imposed. \n• If arrangements are not made by the builder by the specified date, impose or recommend sanctions.  \n \nExample : Excluded Individual Employed b y Lender.   \n• An RLC  learns that a debarred or suspended individual is employed by a \nlender.   \n• No party who employs  a debarred individual may continue to conduct \ngovernment business.   \n• Consult Loan Policy prior to contacting the lender. \n• With CO concurrence, notify the lender that the individual has been \ndebarred or suspended by VA and may not be employed until the sanction is \nlifted. Include a warning that continued employment of the individual in \nsuch capacity could result in sanctions a gainst the lender. Provide  the lender \nan opportunity to discuss the matter with the RLC . \n• If the lender still employs the individual after a reasonable opportunity to \nterminate, advise the lender by registered or certified mail that, unless \nemployment is te rminated by a specific date, sanctions will be imposed.  \n• If the lender doesn't correct the problem by the specified date, report the \nfacts to CO with a recommendation concerning suspension or debarment . \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 100 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-9 \n 3.

Reciprocal Actions Based on other Federal Agency \nSanctions  \n  \nChange Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 5  \n• This section has been updated in its entirety.  \n  \na. Policy  Government -wide suspensions and debarments by any Federal agency included \nin GSA's SAM  are recognized by VA.   \n• No reciprocal action or notice from VA is needed.  \n• The participant is automatically  excluded from the VA Home Loan \nprogram.  \n \nRLC s have discretionary authority to impose reciprocal LDPs by giving notice \nto the participant.  VA pol icy is to impose LDPs based on LDPs by HUD/FHA \n(or the  U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA]) without looking into the facts \nof the case and terminate LDPs only when furnished satisfactory evidence of \nreinstatement by such agency.  \n \nThe RLC  may decline to impose an LDP if the participant's record of \nperformance in the VA Home Loan program warrants, and the sanction would not be in the best interest of Veterans or VA.   \n \nCO takes any necessary reciprocal action against program participants based on \nHUD withdrawal of mortgagee approval, or other sanctions besides government -wide suspensions, debarments , and LDPs.  Forward any \nnotifications of such sanctions to CO.  \n  \nb. Procedure \nfor Reciprocal Actions  VA learns of HUD /FHA or USDA  sanctions by w ay of:  \n• A copy of the HUD/FHA  or USDA letter to the participant, or  \n• HUD's or USDA’s list of LDPs and supplements to the list.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 112 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-21 \n 5. Reciprocal Actions Based on other Federal Agency  \nSanctions , Continued  \n  \nb. Procedure \nfor Reciprocal \nActions,  \ncontinued Upon learning of a HUD /FHA  (or USDA) sanction, send a notice to the \nexcluded firm or individual explaining that VA is recognizing HUD/FHA's (or USDA's) LDP, with a copy to CO. Include in the notice:   \n• The impact of the sanction , \n• Programs or activities the participant is excluded from, \n• The geographic area affected , and  \n• A statement that the VA sanction will be in effect until the HUD/FHA (or USDA) sanction has been rescinded.  \n Generally, implement the V A LDP to the same degree\n as the HUD/FHA (or \nUSDA) LDP, and no further.  In such cases, VA will not afford the participant a hearing since any appeal rights are to be exercised with HUD/FHA (or USDA).  \n However, the RLC  may use its discretion to implement the LDP to a greater or \nlesser degree than HUD/FHA (or USDA), or to not impose an LDP. For example:  \n• VA may exclude the participant from a smaller or larger geographic area \nthan HUD/FHA.  \n• VA may allow the participant limited participation in the program.  \n \nIf VA chooses to impose sanctions materially more restrictive than the HUD/FHA (or USDA) action:  \n• The grounds for the additional restrictions must be well documented.  \n• The participant must be afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the \nadditional restrictions.  \nContinued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 113 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-22 \n 5. Reciprocal Actions Based on other Federal Agency  \nSanctions , Continued  \n  \nc. Multi -\nJurisdictional \nParticipants  Before imposing a reciprocal LDP a gainst an interstate participant operating in \nareas beyond your RLC 's jurisdiction:  \n• Contact all RLC s serving jurisdictions in which the participant operates to \nfind out whether:  \n• They have experienced problems with the participant.  \n• They wish to impose sanctions against the participant in their \njurisdictions and to what extent.  \n• Obtain concurrence from CO only if the LDP will be materially more restrictive than the HUD/FHA (or USDA) LDP for any or all affected VA jurisdictions.  \n• Hearing rights are required  for a more restrictive sanction than HUD/FHA \n(or USDA).   \n• Coordinate the contents of LDP notices between all affected RLC s. \n The RLC  may implement a reciprocal LDP to a greater or lesser degree within \nits jurisdiction than another RLC , or choose not to ta ke action when another \nRLC  does.  \n \nEnsure the reasons for the difference in treatment are supported by adequate documentation of all relevant facts, including any differences in the \nparticipant's activities in each jurisdiction.  \n  \nd. Do Not \nAccept Submissi ons \nfrom Excluded Parties  Return any submission received from a participant on the GSA SAM  or HUD \nexcluded list to the participant.  \n Advise the participant that VA is refusing to take action on the case because of sanctions imposed by another Federal agency.  \n If notification of a VA reciprocal action is required, as for an LDP, and has not previously been sent to the participant, send the notice in conjunction with return of the submitted material.  \n  \nVA will honor commitments issued prior to impositio n of the HUD/FHA or \nUSDA sanction.  \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 114 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-23 \n 6.

Work with \nthe Lender If information casts doubt on the conformity of the lender's credit practices to \nthe purposes of the law, spot check or audit the lender's credit underwriting \npractices. Options include:  \n• Request submission of substantiating credit data in selected cases, or  \n• Obtain backup credit reports. \n If the lender's underwriting shows a pattern of clo sing loans not meeting VA's \ncredit requirements or standards, bring it to the attention of the lender's liaison employee (non- supervised lender) or other appropriate officials in an effort to \nimprove future performance.  Participation of the Loan Guaranty Officer is \nrequired in such cases to assure the tone of the discussion is helpful and provides guidance.  \n \nIf after a reasonable period the lender fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance with  numerous significant underwriting errors and/or recurring \ndeficiencies , consider requiring prior approval for all future loans.  Lenders \nwith automatic authority withdrawn may still process  VA- guaranteed loans on a \nprior -approval basis.  \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 115 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-24 \n 7.

Withdrawal \nfor 60 days  Automatic authority may be withdrawn for 60 -calendar days based on:  \nLoan submissions showing deficiencies in credit underwriting after repeatedly \nbeing called to the lender's attention.  Examples:  \n• Use of unstable sources of income to qualify the borrower.  \n• Ignoring significant adverse credit items affecting applicant 's \ncreditworthiness . \n• Employment or deposit verifications were hand carried by applicants or \notherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party.  \n• Loan submissions were consistently incomplete after repeatedly being \ncalled to the lender's attention.  \n• Continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after repeatedly being \ncalled to the lender's attention.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 116 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n                                                                    Chapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-25 \n 7.

Equal \nHousing \nOpportunity Laws and Regulations  RLC s may recommend or impose sanctions (subject to the rules and limitations \napplicable to the particular sanction) against program participants for violations of statutory provisions and regulations governing equal opportunity in housing.  These laws and regulations include the following:  \n Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act (ECOA)\n.  ECOA prohibits lenders from \ndiscriminating against credit applicants on  the basis of:  \n• Race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status,  \n• Age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding \ncontract),  \n• All or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, and  \n• The applicant has in good faith exercised any full right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.  \n \nIt applies to applicants for nearly all types of credit, including home loans, and all aspects of the credit transaction, including:  \n• The solicitation and takin g of applications  \n• Information gathering and dissemination  \n• Credit investigation  \n• Standards of creditworthiness  \n• Credit terms  \n• Credit denial  \n• Loan servicing and collections  \n \nECOA applies to classes of applicants as well as individual applicants; e.g., a lender m ay not ask pregnant applicants about their prospects for continued \nemployment over a certain period unless the same question is asked of male applicants.  VA must comply with ECOA in its role as a processor of prior approval loans, and be watchful for viol ations by lenders when reviewing loan \nsubmissions.  VA may impose sanctions against a lender for ECOA violations \nor refer the case to the Department of Justice f or prosecution, if appropriate.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 127 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 5:  Sanctions Against Program Participants  \n \n5-36 \n 13.

The Veteran ’s information is \ntransferred from eBenefits and the VA employee can then access the record in WebLGY.  \n Note :  If the Loan S pecialist notes that VA Form 26 -1880\n is signed by \nsomeone other than the Veteran , he/she must verify the signatory is VA -\napproved.  Check the Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator System (BIRLS)  inquiry screen in SHARE to verify the signatory and then, follow up \nwith the Veteran  to ensure the application was submitted with their \nknowledge.    \n  \nc. Timeliness \nRequirements  Because the timeliness of the COE determination is paramount  to providing \nthe Veteran  with notif ication of eligibility for a VA -guaranteed home loan, a \ntimeliness requirement has been established.    \n RLCs  are responsible for issuing a  COE determination within 5 -business days \nof receipt (assigned to a Loan Specialis t) of the COE application . The \ntimeliness criteria for acceptabl e performance are meeting the 5 -business day \nrequirement  at least 98 percent  of the time, on a monthly basis. \n Paper COE applications (mailed, faxed, emailed , or in person) must be \nentered into the ACE system within 2 -business days of the mailroom receipt \ndate, and the application received date must be recorded in the “Details” page in the ACE system.  Then, the Loan Specialist will have 5- business days  from \nthe date assigned  to process the COE determination. \n  \nNote:  A determination is defined as  a returned application, an issued COE, a \ndenial letter , or a case pending V eteran S ervice C enter  (VSC) referral. Any \nother status is not considered a determination for the timeliness requirement.  \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 151 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-8 \n 1.

COE Issued \nin Error The COE is a critical document in determining whether the Veteran  is eligible \nfor the benefit , and the loan amount the Veteran  is eligible for.  It is vital that \nevery effort is taken to ensure the accuracy of each COE determination.   \n \n• If VA issues a COE in error and the loan is closed, VA will honor that COE \nand no other transaction, to include Interest R ate R eduction R efinance \nLoans (IRRRLs) , cash-out refinances  or purchases , will be permitted  based \nupon the error COE .   \n  \n• If a COE was issued in error and the Veteran  requests an ROE , then no \nrestoration of entitlement can be granted.  A COE will not be issued in this \ninstance, unless the Veteran  can provide additional supporting \ndocumentation to establish  their eligibility for the benefit.  \n \n• In the event that a COE is issued in error and the Veteran  has not closed on \nthe loan , the RLC that issued the COE must immediately notify the Veteran  \nand the lender , verbally and in writing, of the error and document WebLGY . \n \n• If a COE was issued in error, to include the green paper COEs, the Veteran \nmust establish eligibility.  \n \nIn all instances above, the Loan Specialist must place a thorough explanation \nof the error in the notes section of the COE reference number.  Additionally, \nthe Loan Specialist must make the necessary change to documentation that caused the error .  If the error wa s system generated, the RLC management \nmust  notify VA CO immediately of the error.      \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 153 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-10 \n 2.

Specifics on \nthe 2 -year \nrequirement  Generally, both enlistment and commencement of active duty in a regular \ncomponent of the Armed Forces must have occurred after September 7, 1980, \nfor the 2 -year requirement  to apply ( the 2 -year requirement  does not apply if \nthe individual was a lready serving in the Armed Forces on or before \nSeptember 7, 1980, when an overlap occurs ).  However, the 2 -year \nrequirement  applies to individuals who enlisted before September 7, 1980 if:  \n• They were separated from service without completing  the 90 or 181 \ncontinuous days  active duty requirement , then began active duty after \nSeptember 7, 1980, regardless of any Reserve duty prior to that date.  \nOR \n• Enlistment was under the Delayed Entry Program and active duty began \nafter September 7, 1980.  \nOR \n• The Veteran  was an officer whose service began after October 16, 1981.  \n \nRefer the case to local RLC/R egional O ffice management if the applicant has \nenlisted service in other than a regular component of the Armed Forces and it \nis unclear whether the 2 -year requirement  applies.  \n  \nd. LOS  \nException \nNote  If an ADSM is later discharged  without having met the full 2 -year \nrequirement , and no valid LOS exception exists, eligibility is lost.  It may be  \npossible for a Veteran  to have been eligible when a prior VA loan was \nobtained while on active duty, and then no longer be eligible to participate in \nthe program after having been discharged.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 156 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-13 \n 2.

Other \nQualifying \nService  Active duty pursuant to Executive Order 10957, dated August 10, 1 961, is \nconsidered active duty in a non- training assignment.  The DD- 214 denotes \nseparation from active duty status, but not from membership in the R/NG  \ncomponent . \n  \n Example 1:  John served 90 days active duty, 89  days in peacetime, and 1 day \nduring the Korean conflict.  He is eligible.  \n  \n Example 2:  Katie enlisted in 2003 , for 24 months, but was discharged for \npregnancy after 18 months.  She neither completed 24 months of continuous service, nor completed the period for which she was ordered to active duty. \nKatie is not eligible.  \n  \n Example 3:  Ernest was a Nationa l Guard member activated in 2005 , under \nTitle 10 U.S.C. orders.  His DD- 214 narrative states that he completed the term \nfor which he was ordered to active duty.  Ernest completed at least 90 days during wartime, and he completed the period for which he was  ordered to \nactive duty.  Ernest is eligible.  \n  \n Example 4:  Jane, a National Guard member, completed 90 days active duty as \nAGR under T itle 10 U.S.C. in 1979.  In 1981, she received anothe r active duty \nassignment under T itle 10.  The orders called for 24 months, but she was \nreleased after 18 months so she could attend college.  She is not eligible based on her 1979 service because she did not complete 181 days (which is required during a peacetime era), and she is not eligible based on her 1981 service because she did not complete the full term for which she was ordered to active \nduty.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 158 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-15 \n 2.

Membership in \nROTC does not qualify for the VA home loan guaranty benefit.  \n  \nExample: Hugo was a Naval Academy cadet for 18 months.  He withdre w \nfrom the academy and entered i nto active duty where he served for 6 months.  \nBoth his time at the academy and his discharge from active duty service was \nhonorable.

General \nNotes Pertaining to Exceptions  • If the DD-214 reflects multiple potential exception s in the narrative, the \nVeteran  only needs to qualify for a single exception.  \n• Examples of DD- 214  narratives that are not exception s include the \nfollowing:  \n• Physical standards (includes a failure to meet) , \n• Disability incurred while on unauthorized absence , \n• Volunteered to serve with National Guard / Reserves , \n• Resignation , \n• Voluntary – Miscellaneous reasons , \n• Conscientious objector , \n• Erroneous entry , and  \n• Substance abuse failure.  \n \nNote:  AGR members who have been activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders \nmust have a  narrative that indicates the Veteran  completed the term to which \nordered to active duty.  \n \n   \nExample : Chang enlisted in 1987, and was discharged after 7 months.  His \nDD-214 narrative stated “COG, Dyslexia”.  Though Chang does not meet the \nrequirements established for the COG exception, he does meet the CIWD  \nexception  because Dyslexia was listed in the narrative.  Therefore, Chang is \neligible.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 168 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-25 \n 2.

If a Veteran  is discharged with an unsatisfactory CO S, but \nhad a previous or subsequent tour that was satisfactory, the Veteran  may still \nqualify using the satisfactory tour.  For enlisted Service members, a \nreenlistment or extension will satisfy that the COS  was satisfactory.  \n \nAn acceptable COS  includes:  \n•  Honorable , \n•  General , and  \n• Under  Honorable Conditions . \n In instances where the DD -214 has a COS of Uncharacterized, it is treated as \nGeneral.  \n \nNote:  The Department of Defense ( DOD) is responsible for annotating  the \ndischarge status on the DD -214 (or o ther separating documentation).   Based \non experience, each Secretary of  the DOD may use different language to \nrepresent the discharge status for a Veteran .  VA employees making \neligibility determinations should pay close attention to the description of a \nVeteran s’ COS  to ensure compliance with VA requirements.    \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 169 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-26 \n 3.

General \nRule for \nEligibility – R/NG  Members of the R /NG, who have neither a qualifying tour as an ADSM , nor a \nqualifying Title 10 U.S.C. activation , must have 6 creditable years of service \nand receive an Honorable discharge to be eligible. \n \nNote : If a member of the R/NG has a qualifying tour as an ADSM, use that \ntour to determine eligibility.  \n  \nc. Selected \nReserve Defined  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit within the Ready Reserve \ndesignated by their respective services and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have priority over all other reserves.  All Selected Reservists are in an active status.  The Selected Reserve also includes individuals in active duty for training status.  \nSelected Reserve members participate actively in training periods (drills) and serve on active duty for ADT each year.  This includes reserve members of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.  This category also \nincludes members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard.  \n  \nd. AGR \nDefined  Some Selected Reserve members may also be designated as AGR.  Such \nmembers have been ordered to active duty at so me point in their R/NG career. \nIt is necessary to determine which type of orders an AGR served under (e.g. Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32 U.S.C.).  If the service is performed un der Title 32 \nU.S.C., then the 6- year requirement applies.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 170 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-27 \n 3.

Individual \nMobilization \nAugmentee (IMA)  \nEligibility  \n IMA members perform their inactive training duty with an active duty \norganization and are not typically assigned to a Reserve or Guard unit.  As members of the Selected Reserve, they are subject to immediate, involuntary order to active duty whenever a Pr esidential reserve call -up is invoked under \nTitle 10, United States Code, Section 12304 (10 U.S.C. 12304). They are also \nsubject to involuntary order to active duty in time of war or national emergency when declared by the President or Congress under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 12301, 12302, or 12303. IMA members activated under this Title would qua lify as if they were an ADSM.  \n  \nf. IRR \nEligibility  The period of IRR service is not creditable toward the 6 -year requirement  for \nR/NG members, nor does it count toward the service requirements established for ADSM.   Also, IRR COS does not count .  The R/NG time COS must be \nHonorable.  \n  \ng. Procedures \nfor Determining Eligibility  • Step 1: Does the Veteran  have a qualifying tour as an ADSM as per the \nGeneral Rule of Eligibility for ADSM?  \n• Yes.  Go no further.  Issue the COE using the enlistee status. \n• No.  Go to step 2. \n• Step 2: Has the Veteran  been activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders?  \n• Yes.  Apply the General Rule of Eligibility for ADSM and if \neligible issue the COE as ADSM.  If not eligible , go to step 3.  \n• No.  Go to step 3.  \n• Step 3: Does the Veteran  have a qualifying tour as per the General Rule of \nEligibility for AGR?  \n• Yes.

Determining Eligibility – Reservists & National Guard , \nContinued  \n  \nh. COS  \nRequirements \n– R/NG  If discharged, R/NG members must have received an Honorable discharge for \ntheir reserve service.  A discharge of General, Under Honorable Conditions, Under Other Than Honorable Conditions, Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable is not acceptable.  If the member is s till actively participating, no COS  determination \nis required.  \nAn Honorable COS  must be provided for each separate tour or component.  If \nan R/NG member has a gap in tours with the same component, or changes components, each separate tour must be qualified in order for it to count \ntoward the 6- year requirement . Care must be taken to ensure that a document \nthat evidences a COS  applies to the period of service in question. \n Example 1:  Jim joined the National Guard and served 6 creditable years.  \nHowever, he received an Under Honorable Conditions discharge.  Jim is not eligible.  \n \n Example 2:  Lauren is currently a member of the National Guard.  Her \nstatement of service letter indicates she has been a member and actively participating  for 7 continuous years.  No COS  is mentioned.  Lauren is \neligible.  \n \n Example 3:  After acquiring 5 years of creditable reserve service, Geraldine \nwas discharged in 2007, with an Honorable discharge.  In 2008, she joined the \nArmy Reserves for 2  years.  She  attended drills and earned inactive duty for \ntraining (IDT) points for both years, and was honorably discharged.  Geraldine is now eligible since she has at least 6 creditable years of service and an \nHonorable discharge for each tour served.  \n  \n Example 4: Mortimer served in the Army Reserve for 3 years and was \ndischarged.  A year later he again enlisted in the Army Reserves and served for 3 more years.   Mortimer has evidence of his honorable discharge for the second tour, but does not have documentation evidencing the COS  of his first \ntour.   Mortimer has not provided sufficient evidence to be considered eligible.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 172 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-29 \n 3.

COS  \nRequirements \n– R/NG, \n(continued ) Example 5:  Mortimer provides additional evidence in the form of an \nhonorable discharge from the time he spent  in the IRR .  Mortimer still has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to be considered as eligible since time spent in \nthe IRR is not creditable, nor i s the COS  for IRR service applicable.  \n  \n Example 6:  Mortimer presents a case whereby he claims he evidently served \nhonorably on the first tour in the Reserve;  otherwise he would not have been \neligible to enlist for a second time.  The basis for such a claim is invalid.  A reenlistment or subsequent enlistment is not sufficient evidence that a \nprevious tour was served honorably.  \n  \ni. LOS  \nRequirements – R/NG  R/NG  members must complete 6  creditable years of service.  \n Note :  For Army, Navy, Air Force, or Coast Guard R/NG Veteran s, \nmembership in the Reserves or National Guard begins on the date the enlistment contract is signed, even if the member does not report for  training \nfor several months.  The Marine Corps does not consider the Veteran  a \nmember of its Selected Reserve until he or she begins active- duty training.  \n The period of service served as a member of the IRR is not creditable for qualifying purposes.  \n If an R/NG member has a qualifying tour as an ADSM, the member should be granted eligibility based upon that tour.  This allows the Veteran  to utilize the \nlower funding fee established for ADSM.  \n \nIf an AGR member has been activated under Title 10 U.S.C., the General Rule \nfor Eligibility for ADSM applies.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 173 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-30 \n 3.  Determining Eligibility – Reservists & National Guard , \nContinued  \n  \nj. Creditable \nService \nDefined  For a period o f R/NG  service to be deemed creditable , the Veteran  must have \nreceived at least one point , in addition to the automatic 15 membership points, \nduring the anniversary year.  The first and the last year may have been prorated.  As a result, those years may not have the 15 membership points.  However, the pror ated membership points plus the IDT or ADT may allow the \nVeteran to have a creditable year.  \n \nThe anniversary year covers the 12 -month period commencing on the month \nand day that the Veteran  began service.  If a Veteran  entered service on March \n3, each anni versary year runs from March 3 to March 2 of the following year . \n \nTo calculate a qualify ing year, add membership points and ADT and \nIDT/weekend drill points , which must equal at least 16 points . Correspondence \ncourse  points  must not  be added because they are not qualifying points . \n \n Example 1 : Geraldine enlisted in the Reserve on July 3, 2001.  She attended \none drill in November 2001, and did not return the rest of the year.  She received points for the year, therefore the year  (July 3, 2001 through July 2, \n2002)  is deemed to be creditable.  \n  \n Example 2 : Geraldine did not drill for the next 13 months, but did attend drills \nregularly thereafter until her discharge on July 2, 2007.  Her point statement reflected IDT points for 5 years  and membership points for 6 years.  Geraldine \nis not eligible since she did not earn qualifying points for 6 years.  \n \nNote :  The 6 years  of service need not be continuous, nor in the same \ncomponent or unit.  \n  \nk. Retired \nR/NG  \nMembers  Members of the Reserves or Guard who have completed 20 years of service \noften receive a ‘20 -year letter’ , which verifies the successful completion of 20 \nyears as an active R/NG member.    \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 174 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-31 \n 3.

Activated \nR/NG \nMembers Defined  R/NG members typically perform their duties under an inactive duty training \nstatus; IDT consists of weekend drills.  When a n R/NG member is activated, \nthe member may be serving under an ADT status, or may be serving in a duty status that is not part of any training exercise (e.g. mobilization).  \n \n  \nb. Exception  If an R/NG member has been activated in a  non-training status, the member \nmay be eligible to qualify using the General Rule for Eligibility that covers ADSM.  To qualify, the following conditions must exist:  \n• Activation must be under Title 10 U.S.C.,  \n• Activation cannot be for training purposes,  \n• The member must meet the General Rule for Eligibility LOS \nrequirements established for ADSM, and  \n• The member must meet the General Rule for Eligibility COS \nrequirements established for ADSM.  \n \n Example 1 : In 1991, Clyde’s National Guard unit was activated under Title 10 \nU.S.C. orders for a non -training purpose.  Clyde served for 5 months and was \ngiven a General discharge after having completed the period to which he was \nordered to active duty.  Clyde is eligible because he met the 90 days for \nADSM requireme nt. \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 176 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-33 \n 4. Activated Reservist and National Guard  Members , Continued  \n  \nb. Exception, \ncontinued Example 2: In 1994, Ben’s National Guard unit was activated under Title 32 \nU.S.C. orders for a non -training purpose.  Ben served for 10 months and was \nhonorably discharged after having completed the period to which he was \nordered to active duty.  Ben is not eligible because his service is considered active duty for training under Title 32 U.S.C.  However, he did accrue points that may be counted toward the 6- year requirement.  \n \nIn some cases, the DD -214 for an R/NG member who was activated under \nTitle 10 U. S.C. in a non- training status erroneously indicates the period of \nservice was for active duty training.  If there is uncertainty about the accuracy of a training declaration on a DD -214, the Loan Specialist will escalate the \ncase to RLC management for revi ew.  The RLC management may confer with \nCO for clarification, and make a determination.  \n  \nc. Reserve vs. \nNational Guard – A Comparison  Reserve members who have been activated typically fall under Title 10 U.S.C. \norders since unlike the National Guard; Res ervists are not subject to \nactivations by the state.  However, the type of orders must be verified so as to ensure the member was not activated under an authority other than Title 10 U.S.C. \n \n Example 1 : Carl was a member of the Army Reserve and in 1991, was \nactivated for a non -training purpose and served for 95 days before being \nhonorably discharged.  Carl provided a copy of his orders as evidence that his \nactivation was under Title 10 U.S.C.  Carl is eligible.  \n  \n Example 2:  Murphy was a member of the Naval reserve.  He was activated \ndue to the potential commencement of a war action in 1990, but his orders were not issued under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C.  His unit was demobilized without having the orders convert to Tit le 10 U.S.C.  Murphy is \nnot eligible.  \n Continued on the next page  \n          \n\n--- PAGE 177 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-34 \n 4. Activated Reservist and National Guard  Members , Continued  \n  \nd. Other \nActivation \nClassification  National Guard members may be activated under other classifications of orders \nas well as Title 10 U.S.C.  Typically, the Guard member will be activated either under Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32.  Any classification of activation orders may be for training purposes only.  \n \n Example:  Clive was a member of the National Guard.  In 2003 , he was \nactivated for a non -training purpose and served for 95 days before being \nhonorably discharged.  Eligibility cannot be determined for Clive until it can \nbe established that he had been activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders.  \n  \ne. Activation \nfor Trai ning \nunder  Title 10  Activations for the purposes of training, even under Title 10 U .S.C., only \ncount toward the 6- year requirement .  AGR members activated for training \ncannot have such service used for qualifying via the General Rule for Eligibility for AD SM. \n \n Example:  Jeremiah was a member of the Naval Reserve.  He was activated in \n2008, served for 6 months, and was honorably discharged.  His DD- 214 \nindicated he had been activated for MOS training.  Jeremiah’s service only \ncounts toward his 6 -year requirement . \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 178 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-35 \n 4. Activated Reservist and National Guard  Members , Continued  \n  \nf.  Tacking \nRule – R/NG  If the period of a Title 10 U.S.C. , non-training activation is not sufficient to \nmeet the LOS  requirements established under the General Rule for Eligibility \nfor ADSM, the period of service counts toward the 6- year requirement  for \nR/NG members.  \n \nIf the R/NG member is subsequently activated again in a non- training status \nunder Title 10 U.S.C., the  period of service may be tacked together with \nprevious non- training Title 10 tours in an attempt to meet the LOS  \nrequirement.  Once the minimum LOS  requirement has been met, the R/NG \nmember may qualify using the General Rule of Eligibility for ADSM.  The \ntacked tours must all have an Honorable discharge in order to make the R/NG \neligible.  \n  \n Example 1 : Marci was activated for 60 days under Title 10 U.S.C. orders in a \nnon-training capacity.  She was demobilized and granted an Honorable COS .  \nMarci is not eligible because her service was less than 90 days.  \n  \n Example 1a: After 1 year , Marci was again activated under Title 10 U.S.C. \norders in a non- training capacity for wartime service.  Once Marci reached the \nday 30 of her activation, she became eligible while still active.  She remained \neligible up to the moment she was discharged.  \n  \n Example 1b: Marci was H onorably discharged from the second tour after a \ntotal of 45 days of service. Her DD-214 narrative disclosed that she completed \nthe period to which she was ordered to active duty.  Marci remains in an eligible status.  \n \nIf Marci received anything other than an Honorable discharge for the second tour, or if the DD- 214 narrative failed to reflect that Marci completed the \nperiod of service for which she was called to active duty, she would lose her \neligibility.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 179 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-36 \n 4.

Rules for Calculating Length of Active Duty Service  \n \nChange Date  May 23, 2017 , Change 2  \n• This section has been updated to revise grammar and formatting.  \n  \na. Purpose  The General Rule for Eligibility requires active service of 90 days, 181 \ncontinuous days, or 24 continuous months, depending on applicant's \ncircumstances.  This section contains the rules and procedures necessary for \ndetermining the length of an applicant's ac tive duty service.  \n  \nb. Procedures \nfor Calculating Length of Active Service  The following steps are used to calculate the length of a Veteran 's active duty \nservice.  Rules for analyzing lost time, travel time, whether time is qualifying or not, and whether  tacking applies , can be found under appropriate headings \nfollowing this chart.  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 Identify period(s) of active service by comparing the entry date \nonto active duty with the separation date . \n2 If the Veteran  has more than one period of active service, add the \nperiods together if necessary to establish eligibility permitted \nunder the tacking rule, which is described below.  \n3 Evaluate reasons for any lost time . \n4 Exclude (d educt ) non-qualifying lost time . \n5 Deduct other non -qualifying types of time . \n6 If necessary to establish eligibility, obtain certification of travel \ntime. \n7 Add certified travel time . \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 181 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-38 \n 5.  Rules for Calculating Length of  Active Duty Service , \nContinued  \n  \nc. Tacking \nRule  Two or more periods of active service, any part of which occurred during \nwartime with an acceptable COS , may be added together to total the 90 days \nactive service required during wartime.  \n \nTacking may not  be used to establish eligibility under the 181 continuous days \nduring peacetime requirement or the 24 continuous months requirement because separate periods are not considered to be continuous.  \nExample:  In 1992, Karen's reserve unit was ordered to active  duty in the \nPersian Gulf.  She served 75 days.  In 1995, Karen was ordered to active duty, and sent to the Republic of Haiti in support of Operation Uphold/Maintain \nDemocracy.  She served 45 days.  Karen is eligible for a regular COE because she completed  90 days of active service during wartime (Persian Gulf War) by \n\"tacking\" the two periods of active service together.  \n  \nd. Lost Time  If the Veteran's proof of military service contains no reference to lost time, it \nwill be assumed there was none. \n Certain types of lost time must be deducted from the period of active duty service.  When deduction of lost time would render the applicant ineligible, \nand the reason for the lost time is not clearly indicated on the discharge \npapers, determine the reason for the lost time by consulting the appropriate branch of the service or permitting the Veteran to provide documentation.  \n \nLost time does not constitute a break in an otherwise continuous period of \nactive duty.  It merely reduces the LOS.  \n  \ne. Qualifying \nLost Time  This is time lost for reasons other than those considered as non -qualifying.  \nFor enlisted ADSMs, this time is generally already added to the end of the \nservice requirement.  As a result, this time is not excluded.  \n Continued on the next page  \n \n \n \n \n\n--- PAGE 182 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-39 \n 5.

Non-\nQualifying \nLost Time  The following lost time must be excluded (deducted)  from the period of \nactive duty:  \n• Periods of agricultural, industria l and indefinite furlough,  \n• Time under arrest in the absence of acquittal , \n• Time the applicant was determined to have forfeited pay by reason of \nabsence without official leave, or  \n• Time spent in desertion or while undergoing sentence of court martial . \n \nReference 38 C.F.R.  3.15 \n  \ng. Other Non -\nqualifying \nTime  The following time may not be included in the period of active service:  \n• Time spent as a temporary member of the Coast Guard Reserve, even if \nthe applicant was on active full -time duty with pay,  \n• Time between the date of induction, of enlistment in the Reserves, or of commission, and actual entrance upon active service, unless applicant was \nissued orders placing him or her on active duty for authorized travel, and  \n• Periods of active duty for training (AC DUTRA or ADTNG).  \n Continued on next page  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- PAGE 183 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-40 \n  \n5.

Travel \nTime  Certified travel time may be included in the period of active service for an \napplicant whose discharge or separation papers indicate at least 83  days , but \nless than 90 days , active service during wartime, or at least 174  days , but less \nthan 181 days , continuous active service during peacetime.  \n \nTravel time must be certified by the applicant's branch of service and may include:  \n• Authorized travel to and from active duty , or \n• Travel required to  proceed home by the most direct route, beginning after \nmidnight on the date of discharge or release . \n \nAn applicant dissatisfied with the certificati on may submit a statement to VA \nexplaining his or her objection to the service department's travel \ndetermination and/or determination of:  \n• The location of the Veteran 's home or place of residence upon discharge \nor release from active duty , \n• The length of travel time allowed for the Veteran  to reach home upon \ndischarge or release from active duty , or \n• The amount of authorized travel time to the place of entry upon active \nduty.  \n \nSubmit the applicant's statement and any pertinent evidence to the servic e \ndepartment for recertification.  An applicant dissatisfied with the \nrecertification will be advised of his or her right to apply to the Chairman, \nBoard of Correction of Military Records of the service department . \n  \ni. Service for \nPay Purposes  Many discharge or sep aration papers provide the LOS  for pay purposes.

Surviving \nSpouse \nDefinition  Unmarried surviving spouses of Veteran s who die on active duty , or later \nfrom  service- connected causes , may also be eligible for the  VA-guaranteed  \nhome loan benefit.  Also, a surviving spouse of a Veteran  who dies on active \nduty or from  service- connected causes  may still be eligible if remarried on or \nafter age 57 , and on or after December 16, 2003.  \n  \nb. Basic \nEligibility  The VSC  must first determin e that the applicant is a  surviving spouse , eligible \nfor or in  receipt of certain types of DIC.  In addition, the surviving spouse \nmust meet VA’s definition of a surviving spouse, as described below under Basic Eligibility.   \n The surviving spouse of a Veteran , who died while in active service or from  a \nSCD , that  is not a qualified Veteran in their own right , is eligible regardless of \nthe LOS of the deceased Veteran . (See Exception 2  of this section.)  \n Eligibility may also be gra nted to the spouse of an active- duty member who is \nlisted as missing in action (MIA) or a prisoner of war (POW) for at least 90 days.  Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited to one -time use \nonly.  \n Surviving spouses of Veteran s who died from service connected causes  \nmay also be eligible if any of the following conditions are met:  (1) the \nVeteran  was rated totally disabled for 10 years or more immediately \npreceding death; or (2) was rated totally  disabled for not less than 5 years \nfrom date of discharge or release from active duty to date of death, or (3) the Veteran  was a former prisoner of war who died after September 30, 1999, and \nwas rated totall y disabled for not less than 1 y ear immediately preceding \ndeath.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 185 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-42 \n 6.

Basic \nEligibility , \ncontinued Surviving spouse entitlement is determined using a VA Form 26 -1817 , \nRequest for Determination of Loan Guaranty Eligibility -  Unmarried \nSurviving Spouses .  A review must first be made to determine if the surviving \nspouse is eligible based on his/her own service.  If the surviving spouse is \ndetermined to be a qualified Veteran  in their own right , then pro cess as a \nnormal entitlement with a VA Form 26 -1880 , Request for a Certificate of \nEligibility . \n If the surviving spouse has Veteran  status as a result of his/her own military \nservice, then the surviving spouse should attempt to qualify as a Veteran .  If \nhe/she cannot qualify as a Veteran , then the application should be determined \nwhether  he/she qualifies as a surviving spouse.  \n If the surviving spouse is submitting a  loan  application for an IRRRL , there is \nno need to submit a  COE  application , as long as the surviving spouse \nappeared on the loan to be refinanced  with the Veteran .  If the surviving \nspouse was not on the loan, he/she would only be permitted to complete a cash-out refinance , upon qualification as a surviving spouse .  \n A surviving spouse with their own entitlement may be exempt from paying a funding fee, if in receipt of DIC .  The DIC must be awarded as primary, \nsecondary, ancillary or Chapter 38.  If the surviving spouse is in receipt of 1151 or pension, they do not qualify for the VA home loan benefit.  \n \nThe Loan Specialist must review information in SHARE, Virtual VA , and \nVBMS to determine whether the surviving spouse is receiving DIC.  \n  \nc. Escalation  The proc ess of issuing COEs is multi -pronged and there are instances where a \ncase will need to be escalated to CO  Loan Policy for review and determination.  \nIn those instances, local management must  review the case and contact CO  \nLoan Policy for guidance.   \n Continued on next page  \n         \n\n--- PAGE 186 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-43 \n  \n6.

Upon \nredetermination of a qualifying grant for DIC , the spouse may reapply to the \nAtlanta RLC for eligibility for home loan benefits.  \n A remarried, surviving spouse whose marriage is void or annulled by a court, is not considered a remarriage; i.e., does not make the surviving spouse ineligible .  A surviving spouse who remarries on or after attaining age 57 and \non or after December 16, 2003, may be eligible for the home loan benefit.  \n Example 1: Jane, the surviving spouse of a Veter an who died in active service \nduring the Vietnam era was remarried in 1980, and then divorced in 1985.  She is eligible, and remains so unless she remarries.  \n \nExample 2: John, the surviving spouse of a Veteran who died in active service during the Gulf War  era and is in receipt of DIC was remarried at age 58.  He \nis eligible, and remains so after his marriage.  \n  \ne.  \nException 2: Total Disability and POW  Eligibility for home loan benefits is extended to the surviving spouse of a \nVeteran : \n• Who was rated totally disabled for a period of 10 or more years \nimmediately preceding death,  but did not die from a  SCD , is eligible \nfor home loan benefi ts; \n• Who was rated totally disabled for a period of not less than 5 years \nfrom the date of discharge or  other release from active duty;  \n• Who was a former POW who died after September 30, 1999, and the \ndisability was rated totally disabled f or a period of not less than 1 year \nimmediately preceding death;  and \n• Is in receipt of a qualifying DIC benefit award  (primar y, secondary, \nancillary, or Chapter 38) .

If the 26 -1817 is not in the system, a return \napplication will be sent requesting that one be uploaded prior to \nproceeding . \n2 Research SHARE and possibl y VBMS t o determine eligibility of \nthe surviving spouse.  \n3 If the s urviving spouse is eligible, the Loan S pecialist will \nprocess the COE to show entitlement code “06” and email to the \nlender.  \n4 If the surviving s pouse is not eligible, the request will be denied \nand the proper letter will be uploaded to correspondence section in WebLGY.  A statement to this affect will be placed in “Notes”, and a copy emailed to the lender and the appropriate attachments, including  an appeal form, sent by mail to the surviving spouse (if \nboth addresses are provided).  \n \n  \nh. Entitlement  The entitlement of the spouse is independent from that of the Servicemember . \nTherefore, the spouse's entitlement is not reduced by any prior use of entitlement by the Servicemember , and the Servicemember  entitlement is not \nreduced by any use of entitlement by the spouse.  \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 188 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-45 \n 7.

Exceptions  \nFor ADSM  There are exceptions to the minimum LOS  requirements for ADSM.  Only two \nexceptions are applicable to those Veteran s who are not subject to the 2- year \nrequirement .  All exceptions apply to those Veteran s subject to the 2- year \nrequirement .  \n  \nb. Exception \n1: Discharge \nfor a SCD A Veteran  discharged or released for a SCD  is not subject to a minimum LOS  \nrequirement.  A discharge for a SCD  is the only exception for R/NG  members.  \n \nThe Veteran  must have been discharged or released specifically due to the SCD .  \nIf the Veteran  was discharged or released from service for a reason other than a \nSCD , this exception does not apply.  \n The subsequent awarding of SCD  compensation by VA is not evidence that a \nVeteran  was discharged due to a SCD , regardless of the percentage of the \nrating . \n DD-214  or NGB  22 Narrative may include:  \n• Discharge for SCD , \n• Disability with severance pay , \n• Disability without severance pay,  \n• Disability – Retired list, and \n• Temporary Disability Retired List.  \n \n Example 1:  Jose was injured on h is second day of recruit training.  The injury \nwas determined to be service- connected and resulted in his  discharge for \ndisability.  Jose is eligible.  \n  \n Example 2: Rupert was injured during his first week of USMC recruit training \nand was thereby deemed to  be ineligible for the military occupational specialty \n(MOS) for which he had contracted, but was otherwise fit for duty.  The Marines offered Rupert an alternative MOS, but he instead opted to be discharged since no other MOS appealed to him.  Rupert was not discharged \ndue to a SCD , so he is not eligible.  \n Continued on next page  \n\n--- PAGE 189 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-46 \n 7.

Exception \n1: SCD \n(Continued)  Example 3:  Irving enlisted in 2003, and was discharged 2 months later due to \nhardship.  At the time of discharge, Irving was awarded SCD compensation. \nIrving is not eligible.  Thoug h he was recognized as having a  SCD, the \ndisability was not the reason for his early discharge.  \n  \n Example 4:  George enlisted in 1986, and was honorably discharged 5 months \nlater.  The narrative on his DD -214 stated that he had been placed on the \nTemporary Disability Retired List.  George is eligible. Though the term ‘temporary’ was used , the Discharge for Disability exception still applies \nsince the disability was the specific reason for George’s discharge.  \n \n VA SCD  compensation documentation is not adequate evidence to indicate a \nVeteran  was discharged due to a SCD .  The following are required documents \nto determine a SCD  exception:  \n Application Materials for SCD  exceptions include:   \n1.  VA Form 26 -1880\n, Request for a Certificate of Elig ibility , \n2.  Official service records/documents (or data contained in internal electronic systems) substantiating discharge or release for  a SCD , and \n3.  A DD- 214. \n Refer to your local station management if:  \n• The Veteran claims discharge or release for a SCD  and documentation \nis unclear,  \n• The adequacy of documents submitted to verify service is in question, or \n• Doubt exists for any other reason.   \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 190 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-47 \n 7.

Exception \n2: Veteran  is \nCurrently on \nActive Duty  This exception applies to ADSMs who are currently on active duty.  \n An enlistee who is currently serving on active duty must only meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day (peacetime) minimum LOS requirement.  \n• The 24- month requirement does not apply until the Veteran  has been \ndischarged.  \n• The COS  is automatically considered to be honorable.   \n \nIf the Veteran  has a qualifying prior active duty tour, that tour can be used for \nqualification purposes.  \n  \nExample:  Wilbur enlisted in the Army 90 days ago (wartime) and is still \nserving on active duty.  Wilbur is eligible.  A statement of service signed by or at the direction of the adjutant or personnel officer or commanding officer of the applicant's unit i s required as proof of \nmilitary service.  An electronic signature on the document is acceptable.  The statement of service must clearly indicate:  \n• The Veteran ’s full name , \n• Social security number (last 4 digits is acceptable) , \n• The date of entry onto active duty , \n• The duration of lost time, if any , and  \n• The name of the command providing the information. \n \nIf the statement of service being provided is for an activated member of the \nR/NG, it must include the type of orders under which the Veteran  is serving \n(typica lly Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32) and whether the Veteran  is serving in a \ntraining status.  If VA systems indicate that person is on active duty and has \nbeen for the required length of time, a conditioned COE can be issued without \nthe documentation noted abo ve. \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 191 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-48 \n 7.

Subsequent \nDischarge  If the Veteran  is later discharged prior to completing the minimum LOS \nrequired for the era of service, or is discharged under Other Than Honorable, \nBad Conduct, or Dishonorable conditions, the Veteran  is no longer eligible. \nPlease be aware that a COS  indicated as Other than Honorable or Bad Conduct \nwill be submitted to a VS C for review in order to determine if an upgrade to an \nacceptable COS  can be made.   These cases would follow the escalation \nprocess stated in section 1c of this Chapter.  \n \n Example:  Mike enlisted in 1992 , and served 90 days on active duty.  At that \npoint he became eligible and used his home loan benefit.  However, he was discharged for misconduct after having served just 18 months.  His COS  was \nUnder Honorable Conditions.  Therefore, while Mike was once eligible and received a valid COE, he is no longer eligible since he did not complete the \nrequired 24 months of service.  \n  \ne. Special \nProcedures for \"Still on Active Duty\" Exception  The procedures below apply to ADSMs who have not met the 2 -year \nrequirement , but are eligible because they are still on activ e duty and have met \nthe 90 or 181 day requirement of the General Rule for Eligibility.   \n \nIf Then  \nApplicant is eligible \nby reason of this exception and is still \non active duty … …COE should be conditioned to read, \"Valid unless \ndischarged or released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of continuous active duty \nas of date of note is required.\"  \nVeteran  \nsubsequently fails to complete 2 years or the full period for which ordered to active duty , or is \ndishonorably discharged,  and is \nno longer eligible … 1. Do not restore entitlement used for a loan \nwhile in service or allow the use of any remaining entitlement. (IRRRLs do not require restoration or updated proof of eligibility.  Therefore, the Veteran  may still \nobtain an IRRRL).  \n2. Do not ret urn any COE received for updating \nor with a restoration request. \n3. Notify the Veteran  in writing of the reason for \nlost eligibility, including information on \nappeal rights.  \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 192 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-49 \n 7.

Exception 3: \nCompensable \nSCD An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirement to warrant the c ompensable SCD  exception.  \n This exception appli es when an enlistee was discharged for reasons other  than \na SCD , but was later determined to have a compensable SCD . \n \n Example 1:  Warren enlisted in 1999, and was discharged for failing to meet \nphysical standards 15 months later.  He was later determined to have a \ncompensable SCD .  Warren is eligible.  \n  \n Example 2:  Franklin enlisted in 1986 , and served 63 days before being \ndischarg ed due to an erroneous entry.  He was later determined to have a \ncompensable SCD.  Franklin is not eligible since he did not meet the 90 day \n(war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) requirement.  \n  \n Example 3:  Clarabelle enlisted in the Na tional Guard and completed 4 years \nof creditable service.  As per her NGB  22, she was discharged due to a SCD .  \nShe never served on active duty, and was never activated under Title 10 U.S.C. orders.  Clarabelle is eligible since she \nwas specifically discharged  from the \nGuard due to a SCD . \n  \n Example 4 : Jasper enlisted in the National Guar d and was discharged after 3  \nyears due to a lack of participation. Subsequent to his discharge, he was awarded a compensable SCD claim. Jasper is not eligible since he was not \ndischarged due to a SCD . \n  \n Example 5:  Elton served 12 days in the Air Force.  As per the narrative on his \nDD-214, Elton was discharged due to a personality disorder.  He was \nsubsequently awarded a 100 percent  rating from  VA for a  SCD  related to the \npersonality disorder.  This should be referred to the VSC to determine whether \nhe could have been discharged for a SCD . \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 193 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-50 \n 7.

Exception \n4: Early Out  An early -out discharge under 10 U.S.C. 1171 is available only:  \n• To enlisted persons, w ithin 3 months before expiration of the term of \nenlistment or extended enlistment.  \n• Does not apply to Public Health Service (PHS) or National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  since only officers serve in \nthese organizations. \n• ADSM with an early -out discharge  after serving 21 months of a 3- year \nenlistmen t does not meet the requirement, and  \n• ADSM with an  early -out discharge  after 21 months served of a 2- year \nenlistment must fall under this exception to be eligible.  \n \n Qualifying reasons include:  \n• Overseas Returnee,  \n• Separation from medical holding detachment , \n• Acceptance into ROTC , \n• Secretarial Authority , \n• Released within 3 months of End of Active Obligated Service , \n• To accept reserve commission , and \n• Non-retention on active duty . \n \n Example 1:  Gus enlisted in 1984 , for 2 years.  He was discharged 22 months \nlater under Secretarial Authority.  Gus had evidence that his en listment period \nwas 2 years. Gus is eligible.  \n  \n Example 2:  Derek enlisted in 1992 , for 3 years.  He was discharged after 23 \nmonths so he could accept a reserve commission.  Though he completed more \nthan 21 months of service, Derek is not eligible since his enlistment term was \ngreater than 2 years.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 194 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-51 \n 7.

Exception \n5: \nConvenience of the Government \n(COG ) This exception applies to Army Veteran s who served at least 20 months of a 2 -\nyear enlistment.   Veterans who enlisted for ONLY 2 years  can use this \nexception .  If the e nlistment was for a longer period, the Veteran  cannot use \nthe exception.   The Veteran must provide  evidence of the 2- year enlistment.  \n \nVeteran s who were discharged for a qualifying COG reason prior to the 24 \nmonth mark are in this category.  Be sure to review the  DD- 214 narrative.  \nQualifying reasons include:  \n• COG, \n• Parenthood,  \n• Separation to attend training , \n• Surviving son or daughter , and  \n• Army Veteran s discharged for body fat or weight control failure may \nutilize the COG exception provided they meet the COG requirements  \n(Army only) . \n \nNote:  A discharge for pregnancy is not the same as a discharge for \nparenthood.  \n  \ni. Exception 6: \nReduction in Force  (RIF)  An ADSM  must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirement to warrant the RIF exception.  \n A RIF discharge is the result of a reduction in the size of the military.  \n The RIF discharge must have been involuntary.  The discharge is presumed to have been involuntary unless documentation indi cates otherwise.  \n Qualifying DD-214  narratives include:  \n• Reduction in Force , \n• Strength Reduction, and  \n• Early Transition . \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 195 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-52 \n 7.

Exception 7: \nHardship  An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirem ent to warrant the hardship exception. \n \nIdeally, box 25 of the DD- 214 should indicate one of the following:  \n• 10 U.S.C. 1173, \n• ARMY 635 -200 Ch6, \n• USAF 36- 3208 Sect 3c , \n• NAVY 1910 -110 or 3620210, or  \n• USMC Article 6407. \n If box 25 does not reflect any of the above references, refer the case to local station management for determination.  \n Qualifying DD-214 narratives include:  \n• Hardship,  \n• Dependency , \n• Sole parent , and  \n• Humanitarian . \n  \nk. Exception 8: \nEPTS  An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirement to warrant the EPTS exception. \n EPTS does not include a failure to meet physical standards.  A physical standards failure can occur at any time during a Veteran ’s career.  Typically, \nsuch a designation reflects an inability to pass a physical fitness test.    \nQual ifying DD-214 narratives  include existing  prior to service , and f ailure to \nmeet procur ement medical fitness standards.  Medical fitness standards failure \nindicates the Veteran  did not meet the minimum qualifications for enlistment, \nand that the medical reason for such failure was  not discovered until after the \ndate the Veteran  was sworn into service.   \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 196 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-53 \n 7.

Mervin was \ndischarged for a condition that existed prior to service.  Since Mervin \ncompleted more than 90 days of service during wartime, he is eligible. \n \nExample 2: Archibald enlisted in 1982, and was discharged after 150 days for failing to pass the physical fitness test.  Archibald is not eligible since he was discharged for failing to meet the physical fitness standards of his branch, \nnot because of a medical reason.  \n  \nl. Exception 9 : \nCIWD An ADSM must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirement to warrant the CIWD exception.  \n The CIWD discharge is the result of a physical or\n medical condition that was \nnot characterized as a disability, but did interfere with the performance of duty.   \n \nBy definition, CIWD reasons are not disabilities. The DD- 214 narrative may \ndirectly state ‘Condition Interfered With Duty’ or may instead only reflect the \nactual condition.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 197 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-54 \n 7.

Exception 9: \nCIWD, \n(continued)  Qualifying DD-214  narratives may include , but are  not limited to:  \n• Condition Interfered With Duty , \n• Medical condition, not a disability , \n• Physical condition, not a disability , \n• Personality disorder , \n• Failure to medically qualify for flight training , \n• Chronic airsickness , \n• Chronic seasickness , \n• Enuresis , \n• Sleepwalking , \n• Dyslexia , \n• Severe nightmares , \n• Claustrophobia , and  \n• Disability without severance pay . \n \nThe subsequent award of a  SCD rating by VA does not alter the discharge \nstatus of a Veteran  who was discharged due to a CI WD reason.  The Veteran  \nmust still meet the LOS requirements established for the CIWD exception. \n \n Example:  Rudolph was discharged after 21 days due to sleepwalking.  He was \nlater awarded SCD compensation by VA for an injury incurred when he \nwalked into a door while sleepwalking.  Rudolph is not eligible for the CIWD \nexception because he did not meet the LOS  requirement, nor was he eligible \nbased upon the SCD  rating by  VA.  The military discharged Rudolph because \nof the condition, not because of a disability.  \n  \nm. Exception \n10: Expiration of Term of Service  A person must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirement to warrant the Expiration of Term of Service exception.  \n \nA DD- 214 narrative that states ‘Expiration of Term of Service’ indicates the \nVeteran  completed the full term which he or she was ordered to active duty. \nThis typica lly applies to Activated Guard / Reserve personnel (must have been \nactivated under Title 10 U.S.C.  and not in a training capacity).  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 198 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-55 \n 7.

Exception \n10: Expiration \nof Term of \nService,  \n(continued ) This exception can also apply to an ADSM and it do es not require evidence of \na 2-year enlistment.  \n \nQualifying DD-214  narratives include:  \n• Expiration of Term of Service , \n• Completion of Required Active Service, and  \n• Release Due to Demobilization . \n \n Example 1 : Abner was a National Guardsman who was activated under Title \n10 U.S.C . orders in  2007.  He served for 11 months  and was discharged.  His \nDD-214 narrative indicated he was released due to a demobilization of his \nunit. Abner  is eligible since he served 90 or more  days in wartime and \ncompleted the time for which he was ordered to active duty.  \n  \n Example 2 : Stanley was a National Guardsman who was activated under Title \n10 U.S.C . orders in 2004.  He served for 13 months in Iraq, and was \ndischarged.  His DD -214 narrative indicated he was released due to \nmisconduct.  Stanley is not eligible since he did not complete the term of required service.  Note that his 90 or more  days of ser vice in Iraq did not make \nStanley eligible.  \n  \n Example 3:  Fenwick’s DD-214 reflects 1 year, 11 months of active duty \nservice commencing in 1986.  The narrative states “Completion of Required Active Service”.  Though Fenwick did not complete the requisite  24 months, \nhe is eligible since he completed the full term for which he was ordered to \nactive duty.  \n  \nn. Exception \n11: Sole \nSurvivor   A person must meet the 90 day (war time) or 181 day ( peacetime ) minimum \nLOS  requirement to warrant the Expiration of Term of Service exception.  \n \nThe narrative of a DD -214 may provide the following language: Veteran  was \ndischarged or released from a period of active duty of 90 days or more by \nreason of a sole survivorship discharg e. \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 199 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-56 \n 8.

Exception \nfor R/NG  The R/NG only has one exc eption for completion of the 6 -year LOS \nrequirement.   \n  \nb. Exception \n1: Discharge \nfor a  SCD A discharge for a SCD is the only exception for R/NG members.  \n \nThe Veteran must have been discharged or released specifically due to the SCD.  \nIf the Veteran was discharged or released from service for a reason other than a SCD, this exception does not apply.  \n The subsequent awarding of SCD compensation by VA is not evidence that a Veteran was discharged due to a SCD, regardless of the percentage of the rating.  \n DD-214  or NGB 22 Narrative may include:  \n• Discharge for SCD,  \n• Disability with severance pay,  \n• Disability without severance pay,  \n• Disability – Retired list, and  \n• Temporary Disability Retired List.  \n \n Example 1:  Rhonda  was injured on h er second day of training  while on active \nduty.  The injury was determined to be service -connected and resulted in h er \ndischarge for disability.

Active Duty \nServicemember \nCOS  \nRequirements  A Veteran  must complete at least one satisfactory period of service to be \ndeemed eligible.  If a Veteran  is discharged with an unsatisfactory COS , but \nhad a previous or subsequent tour that was satisfactory, the Veteran  may \nstill qualify using the satisfactory tour.  For enlisted Service members, a \nreenlistment or extension will satisfy that the COS  was satis factory.  \n An acceptable COS  includes:  \n• Honorable , \n• General , and  \n• Under Honorable Conditions . \n Note:  The Department of D efense ( DOD)  is responsible for annotating the \ndischarge status on the DD -214 (or other separating documentation).   \nBased on  exper ience, ea ch Secretary for DOD may use different language to \nrepresent  the discharge status for a Veteran .  VA employees making \neligibility determinations should pay close attention to the description of a Veteran s’ COS  to ensure compliance with VA requirements.    \n \nExample : Phillip enlisted in 1984, and served in the Navy for 2 years.  At \nthe end of his tour, he reenlisted for another 2 years.  Up to the point of reenlistment, Phillip’s service was satisfactory.  6 months after  Phillip      \nre-enlisted , he was subjected to a court martial.  Phillip was ultimately \ndischarged under a Dishonorable COS.  Even though Phillip was discharged under dishonorable conditions, Phillip is eligible based upon the completion \nof his first satisfactory 24 -month tour.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 201 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-58 \n 9.

A discharge of General, Under Honorable Conditions, \nUnder Other Than Honorable Conditions, Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable is not acceptable.  If the member is still actively participating, no COS determination is required.  \nAn Honorable COS must be provided for each separate tour or component.  If an R/NG member has a gap in tours with the same component, or changes components, each separate tour must be qualified in order for it to count toward the 6- year requirement. Care must be taken to ensure that a document \nthat evidences a COS applies to the period o f service in question. \n  \nc. Acceptable \nForms of Verification  A Veteran  or Servicemember ’s COS  is a critical element  in the determination \nof eligibility for the home loan benefit.  Each classification  of a Veteran  or \nServicemember  may have alternative forms of documentation that \ndemonstrate an acceptable COS  during a period of military service.  \nFollowing are a list of acceptable alternative forms of verification for each classification of Veteran  or Servicemember :  \n \nService  Forms o f Verification  \nADSM  DD-214 \n Statement of Service Letter  \n VIS – Veteran  information solution: may be used \nto confirm active duty service.  \n SHARE  \n Discharge certificate ( DD-256) \nR/NG s members   DD-214 \n DD-256 (Discharge  certificate)  \n DD-257 (General discharge certificate)  \n Discharge orders  \n SHARE  \n Statement of Service Letter  \n NGB -22 \nVeteran s  DD-214 \n DD-256 (Discharge  certificate)  \n DD-257 (General discharge certificate)  \n SHARE  \n VIS  \n Discharge certificate  \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 202 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-59 \n 9.

Subsequent \nDischarge  If the Veteran  is later discharged prior to completing the minimum LOS \nrequired for the era of service, or is discharged under Other Than Honorable, Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable conditions, the Veteran  is no longer eligible.  \n Do note that a COS  that is Other than Honor able or Bad Conduct will be \nsubmitted to a VSC for review in order to determine if an upgrade to an acceptable COS  can be made.  \n \n Example : Mike enlisted in 1992 , and served 90 days on active duty.

Bonus \nEntitlement  Bonus entitlement is a fluctuating amount, and may only be changed by  \nCongressional action.  The exact amount of the bonus entitlement that is available depends on the county where the subject property is located.  The bonus entitlement is $68,250 and an y loan amount made using this authority \nmust exceed $144,000.  VA allows for a greater loan limit when the subject property is located within a high- cost county, which in turn has the effect of \nincreasing the amount of entitlement that a Veteran  has available.   \n The level of bonus entitlement for non- high cost areas is set at $68,250, \nwhich provides for a full guaranty on additional financing up to $273,000 (68,250 x 4 = $273,000). When coupled with the base entitlement, the bonus entitlement provides for a combined entitlement of $104,250, which translates \ninto a maximum guaranteed loan amount of $417,000 ( $144,000 + $273,000 \n= $417,000).    \n \nThe lev el of bonus entitlement in high- cost areas is set  at 25  percent  of the \nloan limit amount in the county.  The maximum guaranty amount will be based on the One -Unit (single -family residence) limit, as prescribed by the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency.   \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 205 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-62 \n 11.

General \nRule for \nRestoration of Entitlement  In order to restore the entitlement that was used to obtain a current or prior \nVA-guaranteed loan, at least one  of the following four sets of conditions must \nbe satisfied:  \n \nDISPOSAL AND REPAYMENT   \n• The property which secured the old VA loan has been disposed of by \nthe Veteran  or has been destroye d by fire or other natural hazard, and  \n• The loan has been paid -in-full, or if VA has suffered a loss on the loan, \nthe loss has been paid -in-full, or VA has been released from liability as \nguarantor or insurer . \n \nREFINANCE   \n• The old VA loan has been paid -in-full (or will be paid-in-full by the \nnew loan) ,  \n• The Veteran  will be using his or her entitlement to obtain a new loan \nsecured by the same property which secured the VA loan paid -in-full, \nand \n• The new loan will refinance a mortgage or other lien on the property.  \n ONE -TIME RESTORATION   \nThe old VA loan has been paid -in-full, but the property securing it has not \nbeen dispose d of (and the conditions for REFINANCE above are not met).  \nThese conditions of restoration can be used by the Veteran  one time on ly\n.  \nAfter such use, any  future restoration will require the Veteran  to dispose of all \nproperty previously financed with a VA loan.  \n SUBSTITUTION OF ENTITLEMENT   \nA qualified Veteran  has agreed to assume the loan and substitute his or her \nentitlement for that of the Veteran  whose entitlement is currently tied to the \nloan.  \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 206 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-63 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nb. Specifics on \n\"Disposal and \nRepayment\"  The following chart explains restoration under \"Disposal and Repayment\" \nconditions in further detail. \n \nIssue  Explanation  \nTiming  The timing of the disposal of the property and repayment \nof the loan does not matter; either can occur before or \nafter the other, or at the same time,  as long as both have \noccurred prior to restoration.  \nDisposal  Disposal includes either:  \n• Sale of the property, including sale by assumption, or \nsale by installment sales contract, under which the \nVeteran  retains legal title to the property subject to \nthe right of the purchaser to  acquire legal title upon \nsatisfying all contract te rms (the loan paid -in-full), or \n• Transfer of the deed (e.g. quit -claim deed).  \n \nProof of \nDisposal  Evidence of disposal:  \n• VA Form 26- 1880 : Veteran ’s declaration of \nownership of property pre viously encumbered by a \nVA loan,  \n• Closing disclosure, HUD -1 settlement sta temen t or \nsimilar documentation, or  \n• Warranty deed evidencing transfer of ownership. \n  \nRelocation \nContract  A signed contract  under a company plan to purchase a \nborrower's home when he or she is transferred will meet the disposal requirement  once the loan is paid -in-full.  A \nsigned contract alone does not meet the disposal requirement.  Consult local RLC management in such \ncases . \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 207 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-64 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nb. Specifics on \n\"Disposal and \nRepayment\"  \n(continued)  Issue  Explanation  \nEvidence of \nLoan Payoff  The following are acceptable as conclusive evidence of \na paid -in-full loan:  \n• Evidence in the electronic information systems the \nloan is paid -in-full. \n• Canceled L oan G uaranty C ertificate  or notice from \nthe lender.  \n• Station's determination that the loan is statistically paid-in-full. \n• Other reliable evidence (e.g. California escrow closing statement, closing disclosure or HUD -1 \nsettlement statement that clearly indicates payment \nof the loan in full).  \n• A cancelled security deed that clearly identifies the \nsubject VA loan (VA L oan Identifi cation N umber ), \nor describes the property and loan in sufficient \ndetail so as to ensure the deed is for the subject VA \nloan. \n• Contact with the holder confirming paid- in-full \nstatus . \n• For pri or direct loans; check with the portfolio \noversight unit . \n \nNote :  \n• A credit report entry is not sufficient  evidence a \nloan has been paid -in-full because reporting may \nnot show a mortgage not yet reported, but recently \nclosed .  \n• A warranty deed evidencing property transfer only evidences the conveyance of real property; it does not verify the loan has been paid -in-full. \n• A closing disclosure/ settlement statement must be \nreviewed so as to ensure the VA loan was paid off as part of the transaction, and not merely  assumed \nby the borrower (loan taken ‘subject to’).  \n \nLoans Coded \n“Not Reported \nAs Active”  Loans coded “Not Reported As Active” may be coded \nas Paid -in-Full. \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 208 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-65 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nb. Specifics on \n\"Disposal and \nRepayment\"  \n(continued)   \nIssue  Explanation  \nRepayment of \nLoss  Entitlement can be restored if:  \n• The Government has paid a claim for guaranty or \ninsurance and the Veteran  has fully repaid any loss \nincurred by the Government due to such claim payment, OR  \n• VA accepted, or authorized the holder to accept, a \nvoluntary conveyance of the property (deed- in-lieu \nof foreclosure) and the Veteran  fully repays any loss \nincurred by the Government due to such \nconveyance.  \n \nWhere a joint loan is involved, the Veteran  must only \nrepay his/her portion of the guaranty that was allocated.  \n VA's waiver or compromise of the right to collect indebtedness from the Veteran  does not satisfy this \nrequirement, nor does discharge of debt through \nbankruptcy.  Actual repayment of the Government's loss is required for restoration of entitlement.  \n \nRelease of VA's \nliability  When the Secretary of Defense accepts a conveyance \nand assumes , but does not pay off , the loan, evidence \nthat DoD has acquired the property and assumed the loan is construed as releasing VA from liability as \nguarantor or insurer.  \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 209 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-66 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nc. Specifics on \nRefinance The following chart explains restorations associated with a refinance:  \n \nIssue  Explanation  \nApplicability  • The Veteran  may obtain a restoration of entitlement \nin cases where a VA Cash -Out or Regular \nRefinance loan is being sought, and the Veteran \ncurrently has a VA loan on the subject property, OR  \n• The Veteran  previously had a VA loan on the subject \nproperty, and there is currently some type of lien on \nthe property.  \n \nDesignation  VA designates such loans as a ‘Cash -Out Refinance’ \nwhen cash proceeds are obtained at the closing, or  as a \n‘Regular Refinance, if the borrower does not obtain cash proceeds from the transaction.  ‘Regular Refinance’ is the designation VA uses to describe what the mortgage \nindustry often refers to as a ‘Rate &  Term Refinance’.  \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 210 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-67 \n  \n11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nc. Specifics on \nRefinance \n(continued)  Issue  Explanation  \nRequirements  The Cash -Out or Regular Refinance VA loan must be \nused to refinance either:  \n• An existing VA loan , \n• A conventional or FHA loan, or   \n• Any other type of lien that is secured by the \nsubject property.  \n \nA Cash -Out or Regular Refinance can only be \nperformed in cases where there is an existing lien on the subject property; if the property is held ‘free & clear’, a VA refinance cannot occur.   There is no seasoning requirement for a lien that is to be paid off with a VA refinance.  \n A Cash -Out or Regular Refinance loan requires the \nborrower to meet all qualifying criteria established for VA purchase loans, to include occupancy requirements.  \nThe Veteran  must provide a signed certification that the \nproperty to be refinanced is the same property for which the Veteran  previously used the entitlement to be \nrestored.  \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 211 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-68 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nd. Any Other \nType of Lien \nThat is Secured by the Subject Property\n \n   Issue  Explanation  \nCOE Conditions  The issued COE will contain a condition which states \nthat the COE is only valid for a refinance of the subject property.  \n The Veteran  must provide a signed certification that the \nproperty to be refinanced is the same property for which the Veteran  previously used the entitlement to be \nrestored.  \n \nIRRRLs  IRRRLs do not require a restoration; therefore, they are \nnot within the scope of thi s discussion.  \n \n  \ne. Restoration \nof Entitlement Examples  The following chart provides examples for restoration of entitlement.  \n \nExample 1  Jebediah bought a home in 1985 , using a portion of his \nVA entitlement.  He sold the property and paid his loan in full in 1987.  The entitlement encumbered on Jebediah’s VA loan can be fully restored.  \n \nExample 2  Rafael does not sell the subject property, but he does \nexecute a quit -claim deed.  He has effectively disposed \nof the property, but the encumbered entitlement cannot be fully res tored until the VA loan is paid- in-full. \n \nExample 3  Jake purchased a property in Memphis using his VA \nentitlement.  Jake lost his property to foreclosure, whereby VA incurred a loss.  Jake cannot obtain a restoration of the entitlement encumbered on the subject property until the loss has been paid -in-full.  However, \nJake may have the ability to use his remaining entitlement.  \n \nNote : The new loan amount and county loan limits \nwould both be factors in future eligibility \nconsiderations . \n \n Continued on next page  \n   \n\n--- PAGE 212 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-69 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \ne. Restoration \nof Entitlement \nExamples  \n(continued)  Example 4  Bentley sold his home and allowed Cornelius to assume \nhis VA loan.  Cornelius did not substitute entitlement, but he did assume the liability for the loan.  Though Bentley no longer owns the property and is not liable for the loan, his entitlement remains encumbered until the loan has been paid -in-full. \n \nExample 5  - \nRegular/Cash - \nOut Refinance  Sally purchased a home with a VA loan and then \nrefinanced the loan with an FHA loan.  She now wants to refinance the same home back to a VA loan.  She can obtain a restoration for refinance only to use with a regular refinance on her existing property.  \n \nExample 6  - \nRegular/Cash - \nOut Refinance  John has an existing VA loan and wants to obtain a VA \ncash-out refinancing loan.  He can obtain restoration \nsince the requirement for the prior VA loan to be paid-\nin-full is considered met when closing of the new loan \noccurs.  \n \nExample 7  – \nOne-Time \nRestoration  Jody purchased a home with a VA loan using all of her \nentitlement, and then refinanced it to a conventional \nloan.  She now wants to purchase another home to occupy, using a VA loan.  Jody can do so under \"one -\ntime\" restoration conditions.  However, she may not be granted restoration again to purchase another home until both of those properties are disposed of and paid -\nin-full.   \n \nExample 8  - \nDisposal and Repayment  Anthony purchased a home with a VA loan, then sold it \nby assumption and obtained a release of liability , but \ndid not obtain a substitution of entitl ement.  The loan \nwas subsequently foreclosed, and VA paid a claim to the lender.  No debt/loss was established against Anthony; however, he cannot have the entitlement he originally used to purchase the home restored unless he repays the Government for the  loss incurred.  Anthony \ncan use remaining entitlement to purchase another \nproperty.  \n \n Continued on next page  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 213 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-70 \n 11.  Restoration of Entitlement, Continued  \n  \nf. Waiver of \nRestoration \nRequirements  One or more of the requirements for restoration of entitlement may be waived \nby the Secretary only if the Veteran  was a victim of disastrous circumstances \ncaused by conditions beyond his or her control.  \"Disastrous\" usually pertains to acts of nature.  If  station management believes such action is warranted, \nthey must submit the case to CO  Loan Policy for consideration, accompanied \nby a full development of the pertinent facts , emailed to \nLoanPolicy.VBAVACO@va.gov . \n  \ng. Procedures \nfor Restoration  Process requests for restoration of entitlement as follows:  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 Process by the RLC or RO of jurisdiction.   \n2 Require submission and review of:  \n• VA Form 26 -8106 , and  \n• VA Form 26 -1880  or electronic application .  \n Supporting documents concerning the Veteran 's service when \nrequired to substantiate entitlement.  \n For restoration under \"refi nance\" conditions, also require \ncertification that the property to be refinanced is the same as the \none for which Veteran  used the entitlement to be restored.  \n \n3 For insufficient or incomplete applications, request additional \ninformation using system letters and suspend processing pendi ng \nreceipt of requested materials.   \nAlso, suspend processing if prior eligibility was established while Veteran  was on active duty, Veteran  has since been \ndischarged or released, and evidence that service was \"other than dishonorable\" is needed.  \nDo not suspend processing for i ncomplete VA Form 26 -1880\n \nwhen incomplete items are not pertinent to the case.  \n4 Determine the status of the previous loan(s).  \n5 If restoration is approved, code electronic system and issue  the \nCOE.  \n6 Send the updated COE and any original discharge or separation \npapers submitted to the Veteran .  \n \n  \n  \n\n--- PAGE 214 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-71 \n 12.

Purpose  The purpose of this section is to direct the procedure regarding mailroom date \nstamped VA-Form 26- 1880 , Request for a Certificate of Eligibility .  This \nsection contains the rules and procedures necessary for processing manual \npaper generated certificates.  \n  \nb. \nBackground  The Automated Certificate of Eligibility (ACE) system provides a field on the \n“Details” page for the Loan Specialist to enter the application received date, \nwhich is the date the COE request was received in person, by mail,  fax or        \nemail. This information is vital for accurate reporting.  \n  \nc. Steps to \nProcess  Any COE request receive d in person, by mail, fax, or e mail must be entered \ninto the ACE system, and the application received date must be recorded in the “Details” page within ACE.  The following steps outline this procedure.  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 On the “Create Certificate of Eligibility Record” page, enter the \nVeteran ’s social security number (SSN) and select the Search \nbutton.  \n2 Click the word “Accept” for the correct Veteran . \n3 When the system opens a Veteran  record to process , go to the \n“Details” page of the Eligibility Record and enter the Application \nPostmarked Date from the envelope or packaging , if provided.  \n4 In the App. Received Date field, enter one the following:  \nDate stamp received by the station mail room.  \nReceived d ate from the email system.  \nDate stamp from station reception desk , if hand delivered.  \n5 Finalize processing the COE as directed in this chapter.  \n  \nNote : These COE requests shall be worked in the date order received.  \nHowever, if there are special circumstances as with electronic applications, then \nthe request may take priority (i.e. impending closing).  \n Continued on next page  \n   \n\n--- PAGE 215 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \nChapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n \n7-72 \n 12.  How to Process a Certificate of Eligibility , Continued  \n  \nc. Steps to \nProcess   Appeals are escalated to the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) and BVA is \nresponsible for reviewing and making a ruling.  VA CO  does not govern this \nprocess but, as needed, will serve as a consultant to field offices.  The steps \nbelow outline how an Appeal of a COE should be received and processed.  \n \nStep  Action  \n1 RLC receives Notice of Disagreement ( NOD ) and must \ndocument the date stamp in the notes of when the NOD was first received.  \n \nVerify that the NOD is within 1  year of the original denial letter.  \n2 Using the reference number and the social security number, \nverify that the Veteran  does not have another reference number \nwith relevant information attached.  \n3 Verify in VACOLS that no other appeals have been submitted.  \nA pending decision may affect a r equest for a COE.   \n \nIf there is an appeal pending that will affect the COE determination, notify the Veteran  that VA will wait until a \ndecision has been made on the previous appeal.  \n4 Review NOD.  Upload NOD into WebLGY and verify that the \nNOD indicates  a disagreement with VA’s decision.  \n \nIf the NOD does not indicate disagreement, notify the Veteran  of \nwhat is needed and document the system notes.  \n5 Determine if the COE can be issued.  If a COE can be issued, do \nnot record this as an appeal.   \n \nIf a C OE cannot be issued, upload the NOD and complete the \nSOC, as required.  \n6 Create  the applicable SOC letter.  Mail the final letter to the \nVeteran , including VA Form 646 , Statement of Accredited \nRepresentative in Appealed Case , and POA ( as necessary ).   \n7 Document all action (s) in the necessary system of record  (i.e. \nWebLGY and/or VACOLS) .  \n8 If Form 9,  Appeal to Board of Veterans’ Appeal , is received \nwithin 60- calendar days, Form 8, Certification of Appeal , must \nbe completed, VACOLs update d, and the paper appeal file sent \nto BVA with overnight tracking.  \n \n     Continued on next page  \n \n\n--- PAGE 216 ---\nM26-1, Revised  \n   Chapter 7:  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and Entitlement  \n7-73 \n 12.

Not all possible circumstances \nare addressed  therefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexib ilit y in \nadministering this important Veterans’ benefit.\nb.Basic Requirements  \nBy law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that the Veteran is a \nsatisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated income that bears a pr oper \nrelation to the anticipated terms of repayment.\nVA’s underwriting standards are incorporated into VA regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and \nexplained in this chapter. This chapter addresses the procedures for verifications and analysis \ninvolved in underwriting a VA -guara nteed loan. In the event the lender fails to perform their \nresponsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of authority to \nunderwrite and close VA loans.\nc.Lender’s Responsibility  \nLenders are responsible for:\n·developing  all credit  information,\n·properly obtaining all required  verifications  and the credit  report,\n·ensuring the accuracy  of all information  on which the loan decision is based,\n·complying with the law and regulations governing VA’s  underwriting standards, and \nwith VA’s underwriting policies, procedures, and guidelines, and certifying as to \ncompliance with all of the above.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-3Topic 1: General Underwriting Information, continued\nd.Lender’s Procedures  \nDigital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature as defined by the \nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, commonly referred to as the E -\nsign Act.\nThe procedures on the table below address only the credit underwriting of the loan. Chapter 5 \nof this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed when making a VA loan.\nTable 1: Lender’s Credit Underwriting Procedures\nStep Action\n1 Initiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System  (CAIVRS) \ninqui ries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this chapter.\n2 Obtain all necessary verifications.\nThe borrower’s authorization can be obtained separately for the lender’s required \nverifications, or on one blanket authorization form.\nThe Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY provides verification of \nthe amount of the Veteran’s available entitlement, verification of exempt/non -exempt \nfrom the VA Funding Fee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability \ncompe nsation. Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal.\nThe tri -merged credit report and verifications can be ordered by the lender or its agent \nor a party designated by the lender to perform that function. However, these documents \nmust always be delivere d by the credit reporting agency or verifying party directly to \nthe lender or its agent, and never to another party. VA only permits the Veteran to pay \nfor the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs that the lender may incur \nthrough other parties for obtaining the credit report.\n3 Complete VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , in conjunction with a careful review of the \nloan application and supportin g documentation.

However, some special underwriting \nconsiderations also apply and can be found in Chapter 7 of this handbook.\nf.Refinancing Loans  \nThe underwriting standards detailed in this chapter apply to purchases and regular “cash- out” \nrefinances. IRRRLs generally do not require any underwrit ing unless the loan is delinquent. \nIRRRLs made to refinance VA loans 30 days or more past due must be submitted to VA for \nprior approval underwriting. The underwriter must have concluded that:\n·the circumstances  that caused the delinquency have  been  correct ed, and\n·the Veteran  can successfully  maintain  the new loan.\n·Refer to Chapter 6 of this handbook for details on all types of refinancing loans.\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-5Topic 2: Income – Required Documentation and Analysis\nChange Date : February 22, 2019\n·This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \na.Un\nderwriter’s Objectives  \nIt is the underwriter’s objective to identify and verify income available to meet:\n·the mortgage  payment,\n·other  shelter  expenses,\n·de\nbts and obligations, and\n·family living expenses.\nb.Effective Income  \nIncome is considered effective when it is determined to be verifiable, stable and reliable, and \nanticipated to continue for the foreseeable future. Income analysis is not an exact science. It \nrequires the lender to underwrite eac h loan on a case-by-case basis, using good judgement \nand flexibility when warranted.\nTo determine whether income is stable and reliable, the probability of continued employment \nmust be determined through examination of the:\n·borrower’s  past employment  recor d,\n·borrower’s  training, education, and qualifications  for his or her  current position, and/or\n·type of employment.\n·Only verified income can be considered in the repayment calculation.\nc.Spousal Income  \nVerify and treat the income of a spouse who will be contra ctually obligated on the loan the \nsame as you would the income of a Veteran borrower that will be obligated on the loan. \nHowever, to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), do not ask \nquestions about the income of the borrower’s spouse unless the:\n·spouse will be contractually  liable,\n·borrower  is relying on the spouse’s  income  to qualify,\n·borrower  is relying on alimony, child  support, or separate  maintenance payments from \nthe spouse or former spouse, or\n·borrower  resides and/or the property is  in a community property state.\nIn community property states, information concerning a spouse may be requested and \nconsidered in the same manner as for the borrower, even if the spouse will not be \ncontractually obligated on the loan. See Topic 5, subsection a, of this chapter for additional \nguidelines for community property states when considering a spouse’s debts and credit \nhistory.\nThe non -purchasing spouse’s (NPS) credit history does not need to be considered; however, \nthe NPS’  liabilities  must be considered to determine  the extent of the household liabilities.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-6Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nd.ECOA Considerations  \nAlways inform the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) that they do not have to divulge \ninformation on the receipt of child support, alimony, or separate maintenance. However, for \nthis income to be considered in the loan analysis, it must be divulged and verified.\nIncome cannot be discounted because of sex, marital status, age , race, or other prohibited \nbases under ECOA.\ne.Income from Non -Military Employment  \nVerify a minimum of 2 years of employment. Generally, in the borrower’s current position, 2 \nyears of employment is a positive indicator of continued employment.\nIf the borrow er has been employed by the present employer less than 2 years:\n·verify  prior  employment, plus present  employment  covering a total of 2 years, or\n·provide an explanation of why 2 years  of employment  could not be verified,\n·compare any different types of employment verifications obtained (such as Verification  \nof Employment (VOE),  paystub(s), W2s, and tax returns) for consistency, and\n·clarify  any substantial  differences  in the data that would have  a bearing on the \nqualification of the borrower(s).\nUse of Employment Verification  Services\nLenders may use any employment verification service that provides the same information as \nthe “full” verification generated through the “Work Number” for all applicants. Generally, \nthis will include the following informatio n:\n·the current  date,\n·employer name  and address,\n·Veteran’s  full legal  name, social  security  number (complete  or truncated) and job title,\n·employment  status  (Active  or Inactive),\n·length of employment and start date,\n·salary  rate and pay frequency,\n·average  hours per pay period,\n·summary  of year  to date information  including base pay, overtime, commissions and \nbonuses, and reference number  for the verification.\nA current paystub is not required with an automated employment verification service.\nAdditionally, any VA Form 26 -8497, Request for Verification of Employment (VOE) may \nbe an original, faxed, or emailed copy of the original. Previously, VA required an original \nVA Form 26-8497. The requirements for obtaining a paystub have not changed. Hence, the \npaystub may be an original or a copy certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original.\nThe lender may not charge a fee to obtain the employment verification information .\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-7Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\ne.Income from Non -Military Employment, continued  \nVerification with VA Standard Documentation\nAcceptable verification consists of VA Form 26-8497 , Request for Verification of \nEmployment (VOE) or any format which furnishes the same information as VA Form 26-\n8497, plus:\n·paystub(s)  covering the most  recent 30-day period  with year-to-date information, if the \nemployer normally provides a pay stub(s) to the borrower.\n·if the employer does not indicate the probability of continued employment on the VOE, \nthe lender is not required to request anything additional on that subject.\nThe VOE and paystub(s) must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) \nfrom the closing date.\n·For loans closed automatically,  the date of the VOE and pay stub(s) must  be within  120 \ndays of the date the note is signed (180 days for new construction) from the closing \ndate.\n·For prior  approval loans, the date of the VOE and paystub(s)  must  be within  120 days \nof the date the application  is received  by VA (180 da ys for new construction) from the \nclosing date.\nThe VOE must be an original document or an electronic copy. The paystub(s) may be an \noriginal, electronic, or a copy certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original \ndocument.\nAdditional documentation for a borrower(s) employed in building trades or other seasonal or \nclimate -dependent work must provide, in addition to the standard documentation (VOE and \npay stub(s)), the following:\n·Documentation of the borrower’s total earnings year -to-date,\n·Signed and dated individual income tax returns for the previous 2 years, and\n·If the borrower works out of a union, evidence of the union’s history with the borrower.\nAlternative Verification Documentation\nAlternative documentation may be submitted in place of a VOE if the lender concludes that \nthe borrower’s income is stable, reliable, and anticipated to continue for the foreseeable \nfuture; that is, if the borrower’s income qualifies as effective income. Two years of \nemployment with the same employer is not required to reach this conclusion.\nAl\nternative documentation consists of:\n·paystub(s) covering at least the most  recent 30-day period with  year-to date \ninformation,\n·W-2 Forms  for the most  recent 2 years,  and/or \n·t\nelephone verification  of the borrower’s  current  employment.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-8Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\ne.Income from Non -Military Employment, continued  \nDocument the date of the verification and the name, title, and telephone number of the person \nwith whom employment is verified.\nIf the employer is not willing to give telephone verification of the borrower’s employment or \nif verification is in any way questionable, use standard documentation. Alternative \ndocumentation cannot be used.\nPaystub(s) and W -2 forms may be originals, electronic, or copies certified by the lender to be \ntrue copies of the originals.\nf.Borrower Employed for Less than 12 Months  \nGenerally, employment less than 12 months is not considered stable and reliable. H owever, \nthe lender may consider the employment stable and reliable if the facts and documentation \nwarrant such a conclusion.\nDetermine whether the borrower’s past employment, training, and/or education equipped him \nor her with particular skills that relate  directly to the duties of their current position.\nIf the probability of continued employment is high based on these factors, then the lender \nmay consider including the income in the total effective income.\nAn explanation of why income  of less than 12 months duration was used must be documented \non the VA 26 -6393, Loan Analysis .\nIf the probability  of continued employment  is good,  but not well supported, the lender may \nutilize the income if the borrower has been employed at 12 months, to partially offset debts \nof 6 to 24 months duration. An explanation of why income  was used to offset  debts must  be \ndocumented on the VA 26 -6393, Loan Analysis .\nA borrower may have a valid offer of employment which will begin at or after the anticipated \ndate of closing which can be ver ified. All data pertinent to underwriting procedures should be \nconsidered. However, a paystub(s) may not be available.\ng.Recent History of Frequent Changes of Employment  \nShort-term employment in a present position combined with frequent changes of \nemployment  in the recent past requires special consideration to determine stability of income. \nAnalyze the reasons for the changes in employment.\nGive favorable consideration to changes for the purpose of career advancement in the same \nor related field.\nFavorable co nsideration may not be possible for changes with no apparent betterment to the \nborrower and/or changes from one line of work to another.\nIf the lender includes the borrower’s income, an explanation of why income of short- term \nemployment was used, must be documented on VA Form 26 -6393, Loan Analysis .\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-9Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nh. Income from Overtime Work, Part Time Jobs, Second Jobs, and Bonuses \nGenerally, such income cannot be considered stable and reliable unless it has continued and \nis verified for 2 years. To include income from these sources as income:\n·the income must be  consistent,\n·there must be a reasonable likelihood that it will continue in the foreseeable  future  \nbased  on its compatibility  with the hours of duty and other work conditions of the \nborrower’s primary job and,\n·how long the borrower  has been  employed under  such an arrangement.\nThe lender may use this income, if not eligible for inclusion in income, but verified for at \nleast 12 months, to offset debts of 6 to 24 months duration. An explanation of why the \nincome was used to offset must be documented on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis .\ni.Income from Commissions \nVerify commission income by obtaining the VOE or other written verification which \nprovides the following:\n·the actual  amount of commissions  paid year -to-date,\n·the basis  for payments (salary  plus commission,  straight  commission,  or draws against \ncommission, or other), and\n·when  commissions  are paid bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually, or \nother.\n·individual income tax returns, signed and dated, plus all applicable schedules  for the \nprevious 2 years (or  additional periods if needed  to demonstrate a satisfactory earnings \nrecord).\nAnalyze  Income Derived from Commissions\nGenerally, income from commissions is considered stable when the borrower has obtained \nsuch income for at least 2 years. Employment for less than 2 years cannot usually be \nconsidered stable unless the borrower has had previous related employment and/or \nspecialized training. Employment of less than 1 year can rarely qualify; however, in- depth \ndevelopment is required for a conclusion of stable income on less than 1 year cases .\nFor a borrower who will qualify using commission income of less than 25 percent of the total \nannual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses are not required to be deducted from \nincome even if they are reported on IRS Form 2106 . Additionally, the expenses are not \nrequired to be added as a monthly liability for the borrower.\nFor a borrower earning commission income that is 25 percent or more of annual employment \nincome, IRS Form 2106 expenses must be deducted from gross commission income \nregardless of the length of time the borrower has filed the expenses with the IRS.\nOne exception is an automobile lease or loan payment. An automobile lease or loan \npayments are not subtracted from the borrower’s income; they are considered part of the \nborrower’s recurring monthly debts/obligations in Section D on VA Form  26-6393, Loan \nAnalysis .\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-10Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nj.Self-Employment Income Analysis Guidelines  \nObtain a current financial statement in an industry recognized accounting format including:\n·Year -To-Date Profit and Loss statement (if the most recent year’s tax return  has not yet \nbeen  prepared,  provide a profit  and loss statement  for that year),\n·current  Balance  Sheet, and\n·individual income tax returns, signed and dated, plus all appl icable schedules  for the \nprevious 2 years (or  additional periods if needed  to demonstrate a satisfactory earnings \nrecord).\n·If the business is a corporation or partnership, include copies of the signed federal \nbusiness income tax returns for the previous 2 years with all  applicable  schedules, and a \nlist of all  stockholders or partners showing the interest each holds in the business.\nThe financial statements must be sufficient for an underwriter to determine the necessary \ninformation for loan approval.\nFinancial Statements, including a year -to-date Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet \nmust be completed after one -half of the tax -year has passed to verify current income and \nstability of the income.\nThe lender may require an accountant or Certif ied Public Accountant- prepared financial \nstatements if needed to make such a determination due to the nature of the business or the \ncontent of the financial statements\nAnalyze  Income  Derived  from Self -Employment\nGenerally, income from self-employment is considered stable when the borrower has \nobtained such income for at least 2 years. Less -than-2-years cannot usually be considered \nstable unless the borrower has had previous related employment and/or specialized training. \nLess-than-1 -year can rarely qualify; however, in -depth development is required for a \nconclusion of stable income on less-than-1- year cases.\nDetermine whether the business can be expected to generate sufficient income for the \nborrower’s future needs.\nIf the business shows a steady or significant decline in earnings over the period analyzed, the \nreasons for such decline must be analyzed to determine whether the trend is likely to \ncontinue or be reversed.\nIf it is difficult to determine the probability of continued operation, obtain documentation on \nthe viability and potential future earnings, and an explanation of the function and financial \noperations of the business from a qualified party.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-11Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nj.Self-Employment Income Analysis Guidelines , continued  \nDeductions and Expenses Claimed on Tax Returns\nDepreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns and financial statements of the \nbusiness may be included in effective income.\nBusiness or roll over losses must be considered from all tax returns.\nWhat is reported to the IRS on a joint return must be used when applying for a federally \nguaranteed loan.\nOn a joint tax return, the loss must be deducted from the borrower’s income in both \ncommunity and non-community property states.\nOn a joint tax return, when a borrower and co -borrower have been faced with business \nlosses, the Veteran/borrower and his/her spouse may want to consider both being on the loan \nin order to potentially qualify. The credit of both borrowers will be considered.\nk.Active Military Borrower’s Income  \nFor active -duty military borrowers, a Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) is required \ninstead of a VOE. The LES must be an original, electronic, or a copy certified by the lender \nto be a true copy of the original.\nThe LES must furnish the same information as a VOE and must be no more than 120 days \nold (180 days for new construction), from the date of closing.\nFor loans closed automatically, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the date the \nnote is signed (180 days for new construction).\nFor prior approval loans, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the date the \napplication is received by VA (180 days for new construction).\nIn addition, identify servi cemembers who are within 12 months of release from active duty or \nthe end of their contract term. For an enlisted servicemember, find the date of expiration \n(ETS) of the borrower’s current contract for active service on the LES. For National Guard or \nReser ve members, find the ETS of the borrower’s current contract on the LES. Also, if a \nNational Guard or Reserve member is currently serving on active duty, also identify the \nexpiration date of the current active -duty tour. If the date is within 12 months of t he projected \ndate that the loan will close, the loan package must also include one of the following items, \nor combinations of items, to be acceptable:\n·documentation that the servicemember has already re -enlisted or extended his/her  \nperiod of active  duty to a date  beyond  the 12-month period following the projected \nclosing of the loan, or\n·documentation that the servicemember has already re -enlisted or extended his/her  \nperiod of active -duty service  to a date beyond the 12 -month period following the \nprojected c losing of the loan, or\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-12Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nk.Active Military Borrower’s Income , continued  \n· verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or verification  of military  \nretirement  income  following the release  from active -duty service, or\n·verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or verification  of military  \nretirement  income  following the release  from active -duty service,  or\n·a statement from the servicemember that he/she intends to re -enlist or extend his/her \nperiod of active -duty service to a date beyond the 12- month period, plus (1) a \nstatement from the servicemember’s commanding officer confirming that the \nservicemember is  eligible to re -enlist or extend his/her active -duty service as indicated, \nand (2) the commanding officer  has no reason to believe  that such re -enlistment  or \nextension of active-duty service will not be granted, or\n·documentation of other unusual strong positive underwriting factors, such as a \ndownpayment of at least 10 percent from the borrower’s own assets (not a gift), a \nminimum of 6 months PITI, in cash, after the downpayment from the borrower’s own \nassets (not a gift) or clear evidence of strong ties to  the community coupled with a non-\nmilitary spouse’s income so high that only minimal income from the active -duty \nservicemember is needed to qualify.\nIf an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, the above \ndocumentation is not required unless there is evidence that the Officer has resigned his or her \ncommission.\nExample : An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates her ETS date listed on her LES is \n171031 (October 31, 2017) and the projected date of closing is October 1, 2017. Therefo re, \none of the above items is needed to verify future income since her ETS date is less than 12 \nmonths from the projected date of closing.\nExample : A member of the Reserves has been called to Active Duty. The ETS date on his \nLES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active duty orders indicate his active \nduty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.\nTherefore, since he will be leaving active duty before 12 months of the projected closing \ndate, the active -duty income cannot be considered, and his civilian employment and drill \nduty will need to be considered.\nExample : An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates his ETS date is less than 1 month from \nthe anticipated date of closing, and he indicates he will be receiving military retire ment and \nhas accepted civilian employment. Verify his future retirement income from the Department \nof Defense and verify future civilian employment with the Veteran’s new employer.\nAnalysis  of Base Pay\nConsider the borrower’s base pay as stable and reliabl e unless the borrower is within 12 \nmonths of release from active -duty service. Analyze the additional documentation submitted. \nIf the borrower will not be re -enlisting, determine whether the borrower’s anticipated source \nof income is stable and reliable, a nd/or unusually strong underwriting factors compensate for \nany unknowns regarding future sources of income.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-13Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nk.Active Military Borrower’s Income , continued  \nIf an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, the above \ndocumentation is not required unless there is evidence that the Officer has resigned his or her \ncommission.\nAnalysis of  Military Quarters Allowance/ Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)\nInclude a military quarters allowance in effective income if properly verified. In most areas, \nthere will be an additional variable housing allowance, which can also be included. The \nmilitary quarters and variable housing allowances are not taxable income. The lender must \nverify the amount of BAH the Veteran will receive. The BAH amount will change from one \nduty station to another.\nEnsure that the borrower meets the occupancy requirements set forth in Chapter 3 of this \nhandbook.\nVerification  and Analysis of Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) and Clothing \nAllowances\nAny subsistence (rations) and clothing allowances are indicated on the LES. The lender may \ninclude verified allowances in effective income. These allowances are not taxable income . \nThe clothing allowance generally appears on the LES as an annual amount. Convert the \nannual amount to a monthly amount for the Loan Analysis.\nVerification  and Analysis  of Other Military Allowances\nTo consider a military allowance in the underwriting analysis, obtain verification of the type \nand amount of the military allowance, how long the borrower has received it and the \ncontinuance into the foreseeable future.\nMilitary allowances may be included in effective income only if such income can be \nexpected t o continue because of the nature of the borrower’s assigned duties. Such \nallowances include, but are not limited to:\n·proficiency  pay, such as linguistic,  parachute,  scuba, flight  or hazard pay, and\n·overseas  or combat  pay (sea pay, submarine, etc.)\nAll types of allowances above are subject to periodic review and/or testing of the recipient to \nascertain whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if it can be shown that such pay \nhas continued for a prolonged period and can be expected to continue because of the nature \nof the recipient's assigned duties, should the income be added to base pay. Contact the \nborrower’s chain of command if there are questions regarding the continuance of the income.\nIf the duration of the military allowance cannot be determined, this source of income may \nstill be used to offset short term obligations of 6 to 24 months duration.\nConsult the IRS to determine if any allowances for pay are considered taxable income by the \nIRS, unlike housing, clothing, and subsistence allow ances.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-14Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nl.Income and Analysis of Income from Service in the Reserves or National Guard  \nIncome derived from service in the Reserves or National Guard may be used if the borrower \nhas served in such capacity for a period of time sufficient to indicate a good probability that \nsuch income will continue beyond 12 months. The total period of active-duty and reserve \nservice may be helpful in this regard. Otherwise, this income may be used to offset \nobligations of 6 to 24 months duration.\nIncome from Recently  Activated  Members  of the  Reserve or National Guard\nLenders must consider if a borrower, whose  income is being used to qualify for a loan, may \nhave a change in income due to participation in a Reserves/National Guard unit subject to \nactivation.\nIf an activated Reserves/National Guard member applies for a loan, they must present orders \nindicating th eir current active duty tour is not to exceed 12 months.\nExample : The borrower’s full-time civilian employment is $3,000 per month. The \nborrower’s current income from the Reserves due to activation is $3,500 per month and \norders are for 12 months. Since the borrower’s full -time civilian employment is only $3,000 \nper month, the $3,000 should be used to qualify the borrower.\nThere are not any clear -cut procedures that can be applied to all cases. Evaluate all aspects of \neach individual case, including credit history, accumulation of assets, overall employment \nhistory, and make the best decision for each loan regarding the use of income in qualifying \nfor the loan.\nIt is very important that loan files be carefully and thoroughly documented, including any \nreasons for using or not using Reserve/National Guard income in these situations.\nAs a lender, the goal is to provide the Veteran their benefit without placing him/her in a \nfinancial hardship.\nm.Verification and Analysis of Income of Recently Discharged Veterans or Veterans to be \nDischarged from the Military  \nSee the Income from Non -Military Employment in Topic 2, subsection e of this chapter for \nverification requirements.\nObtain verification that any of the following income types apply:\n·employment  income,\n·retirement  income, and/or\n·VA disability  income.\nVA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be documented for the \nlikelihood of continuance.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-15Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nm.Verification and Analysis of Income of Recently Discharged Veterans or Veterans to be \nDischarged from the Military , continued  \nVA disability income verification will be placed on the COE.

VA will complete and return \nthe form to the lender by return fax.\n·Provide any supporting documents, including the COE, if it states to send VA Form 26-\n8937 ,Verification of Benefits to VA, to verify a Veteran’s monthly income from VA.\nPlease note that if VA’s Compensation Service has not yet issued a memo rating and/or \ncompleted a claim for a Veteran, then the amount the Veteran may receive in the future \ncannot be determined until the claim has been completed.\nUntil the Veteran begins receiving the monthly award, the amount cannot be placed on the \nCOE. A VA awards letter can be used  to verify the amount and date a future monthly VA \ncompensation award will begin. However, the COE may be updated to reflect if the Veteran \nis exempt from paying the VA funding fee on a future disability award. See Chapter 8 of this \nhandbook for funding fee exemptions.\nThe loan cannot be submitted for prior approval, or approved under the automatic procedure, \nuntil the lender obtains the completed form from VA when the Veteran or surviving spouse is \nunder one of the above categories in subsection m of this topic. The lender must maintain the \ncompleted form with the loan package.\nIf the form indicates that the borrower receives a non service -connected pension or has a VA \nFiduciary, the loan cannot be closed automatically. The loan must be uploaded in WebLGY \nfor prior approval. See Chapter 5 of this handbook for the necessary documentation that must \nbe submitted to VA.\nVA must review, underwrite, and issue a Certificate of Commitment before the loan can \nclose.

This is because some Veterans may have little or no \nemployment experience other than their military occupation.\nContinuity of employment is essential for a Veteran with no retirement income, or \ninsufficient retirement income, to support the loan obligation. If the duties the borrower \nperformed in the military are similar or directly related to the duties of the present position, \nuse this as one indicator that the employment is likely to continue.\nMost cases fall somewhere between these extremes. Fully develop the facts of each case to \nmake a determination. The guidelines under Self-Employment Income in Topic 2, subsection \nj of this chapter provide guidance for a recently discharged Veteran who is sel f-employed.\nn.Rental Income  \nWhen all or a portion of the borrower’s income is derived from rental income, documentation \nand verification of the income are necessary to determine the likelihood of continuance.\nVerification of Rental Offset of the  Property Oc cupied  Prior to  the New Home\nObtain a copy of the rental agreement for the property, if any.\nAnalysis  using  Rental Offset of the  Property Occupied  Prior to  the New Loan\nUse the prospective rental income only to offset the mortgage payment on the rental \nproperty, and only if there is not an indication that the property will be difficult to rent. This \nrental income may not be included in effective income.\nObtain a working knowledge of the local rental market. If there is not a lease on the property, \nbut the l ocal rental market is very strong, the lender may still consider the prospective rental \nincome for offset purposes.

Bonus entitlement \nis being used to purchase a new primary residence and the Veteran will rent the previous \nhome for $1,200 monthly upon closing of the new home. The payment of $1,200 can be used \nto offset the existing mortgage payment, if all the above conditions are met. The additional \nrent received in excess of the mortgage payment cannot be used as effective income.\nVerification of Rental Property Income\nObtain the foll owing:\n·documentation of cash  reserves  totaling  at least 3 months mortgage payments (PITI), \nand\n·individual income  tax returns, signed and dated  or lender  obtained tax transcripts, plus \nall applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, which show rental income generated \nby the property.\nIf the borrower has multiple properties, the borrower must have 3 months PITI documented \nfor each property to consider the rental income.\nIf there is not a lien on the property, 3 months reserves to cover expenses s uch as taxes, \nhazard insurance, flood insurance, homeowner’s association fees, and any other recurring \nfees should be documented for the property(ies).\nEquity in the property cannot be used as reserves.\nCash proceeds from a VA refinance cannot be counted as the required PITI on a rental \nproperty. The reserve funds must be in the borrower’s account before the new VA loan \ncloses.\nGift funds cannot be used to meet reserve requirements.\nAnalysis of Rental Property Income\nEach property(ies) must have a 2-year rental history itemized on the borrower’s tax return.\nProperty depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns may be included in effective \nincome.\nIf after adding depreciation to the negative rental income, the borrower still has rental loss , \nthe negative income should be deducted from the overall income as it reduces the borrower’s \nincome.\nIf rental income will not, or cannot be used, then the full mortgage payment should be \nconsidered and reserves do not need to be considered.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-18Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nn.Rental Income , continued   \nVerification of Multi -Unit Property Securing the VA loan\nThe Veteran/borrower must occupy one unit as his/her residence.\nFor purposes of determining the VA guaranty, lenders are instructed to reference only the \nOne-Unit Limit column in the FHFA Table “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Maximum Loan \nLimits for Mortgages, located  at https:/ /www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads .\nVerify cash reserves totaling at least  6 months mortgage payments (PITI), and documentation \nof the borrower’s prior experience managing rental units and/or use of a property \nmanagement company to oversee the property.\nAnalysis of Multi -Unit Property Securing the VA loan (Veteran will occupy on e unit as \nhis/her residence)\nInclude the prospective rental income in effective income only if:\n·the borrower has a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and\n·cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI).\nIf each unit is separate and not under one mortgage, 6 months PITI must be verified for each \nseparate unit.\nEquity in the property cannot be used as reserves to meet PITI requirements.

The payments must be likely to \ncontinue for at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date to include them in effective \nincome.\nFactors used to determine whether the payments will continue include, but are not limited to:\n·whether  the payments  are received  pursuant to a written  agreement  or court decree,\n·the length of time  the payments have  been  received,\n·the regularity  of receipt, and\n·the availability  of procedures  to compel payment.\nSee “ECOA Considerations” in Topic 2, subsection d of this chapter.\nq.Automobile or Similar Allowances  \nGenerally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related to a borrowe r’s \nemployment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset a corresponding car payment. \nHowever, if the borrower reports an allowance as part of monthly qualifying income, it must \nbe determined if the  automobile expense reported on IR S Form 2106 should be deducted \nfrom income or treated as a liability.\nIf the reported  expense  is less than the automobile  allowance,  the amount can be treated as \nincome and added to borrower’s monthly income.\nIf the reported  expense  exceeds  the automobile  allowance,  the amount must  be deducted  from \nincome  as a net calculation  in Section  D on VA  Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis .\nLikewise, any  other  similar type of allowance  r eceived  by the borrower  should be considered \nwith regards to the tax returns for determination of an offset of the corresponding obligation, \nas income, or as an expense.\nCon\ntinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 20 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-20Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nr.Other Types of Income  \nWhile not all types of income can be listed, documentation of income must support the \nhistory of receipt and the likelihood or continuance of the income for at least 3 years from the \nanticipated closing date to include in effective income. Otherwise, consider whether it is \nreasonable to use the income to offsets short term obligations of 6 to 24 months duration.\n“Oth er” types of income which may be considered as effective income include, but are not \nlimited to:\n·pension or other  retirement  benefits,\n·disability  income,\n·dividends from  stocks or other,\n·interest  from  bonds, savings accounts, or others,\n·royalties,\n·notes rec eivable, and\n·trusts \nVA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be documented for the \nlikelihood of continuance.

Instead of considering a family size of four, a family size of \ntwo should be used to determine the residual income requirement.\nDo not include temporary income items such as VA educational allowances (including the \nPost 9/11 GI Bill benefit) and unemployment comp ensation in effective income.\nException : If unemployment compensation is a regular part of a borrower’s income due to \nthe nature of his/her employment (for example, seasonal work), it may be included.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 21 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-21Topic 2 : Income – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nr.Other Types of Income, continued  \nA borrower in receipt of VA Pension or Disability benefits with Aid and Attendance should \nbe discussed with the VA Pension Service, VA Compensation Service, or the VA Hospital \nwhere the property is located, to determine if the income is likely to continue for the \nforeseeable future.\nIf a borrower has a contract for employment in a foreign country (whether or not the \nemployer is a US company or corporation), the income can be use d if it is verified, stable, \nand reliable.

Select \nthe state listed on the LES for the state taxes to be considered in state tax deductions.\nThe lender may consider the borrower’s potential tax benefits from obtaining the loan (for \nexample, mortgage interest deduction) in the analysis. To do so:\n·determine what the borrower’s withholding allowance will be, using the instructions \nand worksheet portion of IRS Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance \nCertificate, and\n·apply that  withholding number when  calculating  Federal  and state income  tax \ndeductions onVA Form 26 -6393, Loan Analysis , then\n·document the change  in deductions in Item 47, Remarks, on VA F orm 26-6393 ,Loan \nAnalysis .\nb.Income Tax Credits from Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC)  \nMCCs issued by state and local governments may qualify a borrower for a Federal  tax credit. \nThe Federal tax credit is based on a certain percentage of the borrower’s mortgage interest \npayment. Lenders must provide a copy of the MCC to VA with the loan package which \nindicates:\n·documentation verifying any expenses charged by the local government entity for the \nprogram which is listed on the Closing Disclosure Statement, and \nthe percentage to be used to calculate the tax credit, and if applicable, the amount of the \nindebtedness. The certified indebtedness can be comprised of a loan incurred by the borrower \nto acquire a principal residence or a qualified home improvement rehabilitation loan.\nThere is an IRS annual limit on the tax credit equal to the lesser of the borrower’s maximum \ntax liability or $2,000. Calculate the tax credit by appl ying the specified percentage to the \ninterest paid on the certified indebtedness. Then apply the annual limit.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 23 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-23Topic 3 : Income Taxes and Other Deductions, continued\nb.Income Tax Credits from Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) , continued  \nExample:  The MCC shows a 30 percent rate and $100,000 certified indebtedness. The \nborrower will pay approximately $8,000 in annual mortgage interest. The borrower’s \nestimated total Federal income tax liability is $9,000. Calculate the tax credit as follows:\nTable 2: MCC Calculation\nStep Procedure\n1 30 percent of $8,000 = $2,400\n2 Apply the IRS annual $2,000 limit\n3 The tax credit will be $2,000\nThis allows use of $167 (one twelfth of $2,000) as income to qualify the borrower.\nIf the mortgage on which the borrower pays interest is greater than the amount of certified \nindebtedness, limit the interest used in the tax credit calculation to that portion attributable to \nthe certified indebtedness.\nSince these programs are offered by state a nd local government(s), pre- approval by VA is \nnot required for the borrower to participate in the program. The lender is responsible to \ndetermine all eligibility requirements are met by the borrower to participate in the program.\nc.Other Deductions from Inc ome \nInclude any costs for job-related expenses, child care, significant commuting costs, and any \nother direct or incidental costs associated with the borrower’s or spouse’s employment.\nFor children up to the age of 12 years, the lender is responsible for d etermining if there are \nany child care expenses for the borrower(s).\n\n--- PAGE 24 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-24Topic 4: Assets and Closing Requirements\nChange Date : February 22, 2019\n·This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \na.Ass\nets and Amount of Cash Required for Closing  \nTheborrower(s)  must  have  sufficient  cash assets  to cover:  \n· any closing costs, pre-paids, or discount points which are the borrower’s responsibility  \nand are not financed into  the loan, and\n·the difference  between  the sales  price  and the loan amount, if  the sales price exceeds the \nreasonable value established by VA (i.e. negative equity).\nVA does not require the borrower(s) to have additional cash to cover a certain number of \nmort\ngage payments, unplanned expenses or other contingencies on the residence, or \nrefinance of the Veteran’s residence.\nHowever, the borrower’s ability to accumulate liquid assets and the current availability of \nliquid assets for unplanned expenses should be considered in the overall credit analysis.\nReserves are required for borrowers us ing rental income to qualify.

See Topic 7, subsection a of this chapter for details \non the type of credit report required.  \nFor obligations not included on the credit report which are revealed on the application or \nthrough other means, the lender must obtain a verification of payment history  showing the \nobligation or other  written  verification  directly f rom the creditor, including the payment \namount and outstanding balance.\nThe lender  must  also separately  verify  accounts listed  as “will  rate by mail only” or “need \nwritten authorization.”\nWhen  a pay stub(s)  or LES indicates  an allotment,  the lender  must  investigate the nature of \nthe allotment to determine whether the allotment is related to a debt or other obligation(s).  \nExamples may include 401K obligation or repayment, child care, child support, or other.\nFor obligations that have not been rated on the credit report or elsewhere, obtain  the \nverification  and rating  directly  from  the creditor.  Include a written explanation for any \nobligation that is not rated.\nResolve all discrepancies prior to closing.  If the credit report, deposit verification,  bank  \nstatement,  or pay stub(s)  reveals  any debts or obligations which were not divulged by the \nborrowers):\n·obtain clarification  as to the status  of such debts from  the borrower(s), then\n·verify  any remaining  discrepancies with the creditor.\nCredit reports and verifications  must  be no more  than 120 days old (180 days for new \nconstruction).\nFor automatically closed loans, this means the date of the credit report or verification  is \nwithin  120 days of the date the note is  signed (180 days for new construction).\nFor prior  approval loans, this means the date  of the credit  report  or verification is within 120 \ndays of the date the application is received by  VA (180 days for new construction).\nECOA  prohibits requests  for, or consideration of, credit  history and liability information  of a \nspouse who will not be contractually  obligated on the loan, except:\n·if the borrower(s)  is relying on alimony, child  support, or maintenance payments from \nthe spouse (or former spouse), or\n·in community  property states.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 27 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-27Topic 5 : Debts and Obligations, continued\na.Verification Requirements for Debts and Obligations, continued \nIf either  of these  situations  is applicable,  the lender  must:  \n· Obtain  a credit  report  on the non-purchasing spouse in addition to the Veteran’s credit \nreport.\n·Consider the spouse’s credit history in reaching a determination. A Veteran  borrower  \nwith a satisfactory  credit  history may be considered a satisfactory risk even though the \nnon-purchasing spouse’s credit may be unsatisfactory.\n·Include the monthly payment of the non-purchasing spouse’s debts on the VA Form  26-\n6393 ,Loan Analysis. For debts such as judgments and unpaid collection accounts, \nlenders should consider the Veteran’s capacity to address the debt(s).\n·Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the spouse’s credit report, \nsuch as where the judgment was filed and whether the parties were  married  to one \nanother  at the time,  and secure a competent legal opinion whether the judgment may \nbecome a lien against the property.\n·Exclude the monthly payment on the spouse’s debts from the loan analysis when  a \nreliable  source  of income for the spouse is verified  to reach such a conclusion which is \nvoluntarily provided.\n· Document VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis, with an explanation of facts and determination \nwhen concluding credit worthiness of the Veteran or excluding obligations of the non -\npurchasing spouse .\nb.Verification of Alimony and Child Support Obligations  \nThe payment amount of any alimony and/or child support obligation of the borrower must be \nverified.\nDo not request documentation of a borrower’s divorce unless it is necessary to verify the \namount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the borrower. If, however, in \nthe routine course of processing the loan, the lender encounters direct evidence (such as, in \nthe credit report) that a child support or ali mony obligation exists, they should make any \ninquiries necessary to resolve discrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification.\nSpousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan \nAnalysis.\nChild support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form  26-6393 ,Loan Analysis.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 28 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-28Topic 5 : Debts and Obligations, continued\nc. Analysis of Debts and Obligations  \nSignificant  debts and obligations include:\n·debts and obligations with  a remaining  term of 10 months or more;  that is, long- term \nobligations, and\n·accounts with  a term of less  than 10 months that  require  payments so large as to cause a \nsevere impact on the family’s resources for any period of time.\nExample : Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a remaining balance of \n$1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months, would be considered significant. The \npayment amount is so large as to cause a severe impact on the family’s resour ces during the \nfirst, most critical, months of the home loan.\nDetermine whether debts and obligations which do not fit the description of “significant” \nshould be given any weight in the analysis. They may have an impact on the borrower’s \nability to provide for family living expenses.\nIf a married Veteran wants to obtain the loan in his or her name only, the Veteran may do so \nwithout regard to the spouse’s debts and obligations in a non-community property state. \nHowever, in community property states, the spouse’s debts and obligations must be \nconsidered even if the Veteran wishes to obtain the loan in his or her name only. See Topic 2, \nsubsection c of this chapter.\nDebts assigned to an ex- spouse by a divorce decree will not generally be charged against a \nborrower. This includes debts that are now delinquent.\nd.Borrower as Co -obligor/Co-Signor on a Loan or Obligation  \nThe borrower(s) may have a contingent liability based on co-signing a loan. The lender may \nexclude the loan payments from the monthly obligations fa ctored into the net effective \nincome calculation in the loan analysis if:\n·there  is evidence  that the loan payments are being made  by someone else and the \nobligation is current, and\n·there is not a reason to believe that the borrower will have to participate in repayment \nof the loan.\ne.Pending Sale of Real Estate  \nA borrower(s) may have a current home and the sale of the real property is needed to \ncomplete the transaction. The lender may disregard the payments on the outstanding \nmortgage(s) and any consumer obligations which the Veteran intends to clear if available \ninformation provides a reasonable basis for concluding the equity to be realized from the sale \nwill be sufficient for this purpose. See Topic 4, subsection c of this chapter for necessary \ndocuments.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-29Topic 5 : Debts and Obligations, continued\nf. Secondary Borrowing  \nIf the borrower(s) plans to obtain a second mortgage simultaneously with the VA- guaranteed \nloan, include the second mortgage payment as a significant debt. From an underwriting \nstandpoint, the Veteran must not be placed in a substantially worse position than if the entire \namount borrowed had been guaranteed by VA. See Chapter 9 of this handbook for VA \nlimitations on secondary borrowing.\nIf the borrower(s) provides written evidence that the student loan debt will be deferred at \nleast 12 months beyond the date of closing, a monthly payment does not need to be \nconsidered.\nIf a student loan is in repayment, or  scheduled to begin within 12 months from the date of \nVA loan closing, the lender must consider the anticipated monthly obligation in the loan \nanalysis and utilize the payment established by calculating each loan at a rate of five percent \nof the outstanding balance divided by 12 months.\nExample:  A borrower has a $25,000 student loan balance and you multiple it by 5%, which \nequals $1,250. This amount ($1,250) is divided by 12 months to equal a monthly payment of \n$104.17.\nIf the payment(s) reported on the credit report for each student loan(s) is greater than the \nthreshold payment calculation above in a above, the lender must  use the payment recorded \non the credit report.\nIf the payment(s) reported on the credit report is less than the threshold payment calculation \nabove\n, in order to count the lower payment, the loan file must contain a statement from the \nstudent loan servicer that reflects the actual loan terms and payment information for each \nstudent loan(s).\nThe statement(s) must be dated within 60 days of VA loan closing, and may be an electronic \ncopy from the student loan servicer’s website or a printed statement provided by the student \nloan servicer.\nIt is the lender’s discretion as to whether the credit report should be supplemented with this \ninformation.\ng.Loans Secured by Deposited Funds  \nCertain types of loans secured against deposited funds (signature loans, cash value life \ninsurance  policies,  401(k) loans, or other)  in which repayment  may be obtained through \nextinguishing the asset, do not require repayment consideration for loan qualification.\nThe assets  required  to s ecure  a loan(s)  may not be included as an asset  on the VA Form 26 -\n6393 ,Loan Analysis .\nUse the current balance times 60 percent minus the loan balance to equal the usable amount \nto consider as an asset.\nA statement would only be necessary to verify the amount used as an asset.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-30Topic 5 : Debts and Obligations, continued\nh.Open 30 -Day Charge Accounts  \nAn open 30 -day charge account is defined as an account in which the borrower(s) must pay \noff the outstanding balance on the account every month.\nFor open 30- day charge accounts, determine if the borrower(s) pays the balance in full each \nmonth, and has verified funds to cover the account balance in addition to any funds required \nfor closing costs.\n·If there  are sufficient  funds, the payment does not need  to be included in Section D of \nthe VA Form 26 -6393, Loan Analysis, but the obligation should continue to be listed.\n·If there are not sufficient funds, a minimum payment of 5 percent of the ba lance should \nbe considered included in Section D of the VAForm 26-6393, Loan Analysis.\n\n--- PAGE 31 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-31Topic 6: Debts Owed to the Federal Government\nChange Date : February 22, 2019\n·This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \na.Ti\ntle Search Requirements  \nThe lender is responsible for obtaining the necessary title search to ensure there are no \nencumbrances that would preclude the borrower from obtaining a loan.\nb. VA Form 26- 8937, Verification of Benefits  \nThe lender is responsible for obtaining the necessary title search to ensure there  are no \nencumbrances  that would preclude  the borrower  from  obtaining a loan.\nGenerally, VA Form 26 -8937, Verification of VA Benefits, is not needed unless  the COE or \nnew IRRRL  case number indicates  to submit  the form  to VA  before  closing. However, ask \nthe Veteran  and any  Veteran  co-obligors (including spouse if a Veteran) if he or she:\n·will be discharging within  the next 6 months from  the military  and has completed a \nPEB or MEB and will be filing for VA disability while still on active duty,\n·has recently  filed for VA disability  and compensation, or VA  pension, and VA has not \nyet made a determination,\n·would be entitled  to receive  VA disability  benefits,  but in receipt  of retirement pay,\n·has received  VA disability  benefits in the past, or\n·is a\nn unmarried  surviving spouse of a Veteran  (has applied and/or in receipt of DIC \nwho died on active duty or as a result of a\n·service -connected disability.\nIf the Veteran  falls under one of the above  categories,  follow  the procedures discussed in \nTopic 2, subsection m of this chapter.\nWhen  VA returns the form  to the lender  and the form indicates  that the borrower has any of \nthe following:\n·an outstanding indebtedness of VA overpaid education, compensation, or pension \nbenefits,\n·an education or direct  home loan in default,\n·an outstanding indebtedness resultin g from  payment of a claim  on a prior VA home \nloan, or\n·a repayment plan for any of these debts that is current,\nThen  one of the following must accompany the loan  package:\n·evidence  of payment in full  of the debt, or\n·evidence  of a current  payment  plan acceptable  to VA and evidence  that the Veteran \nexecuted a promissory note for the entire debt balance.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 32 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-32Topic 6 : Debts Owed to the Federal Government, continued\nb.

More information can be found at: \nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/caivrs\nThe database includes default information from the Department of Agriculture, Department \nof Education, Department of Justice, HUD, Small Business Administration, Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, and VA.\nThe VA default information included in the database relates to:\n·overpayments on education cases,\n·overpayments on disability benefits income, and\n·claims paid due to home loan foreclosures which resulted in a debt of the government \n(Generally type 2 VA loans).\nCAIVRS Procedures\nA CAIVRS  inquiry must  be performed  for all borrowers  and co-borrowers (Veteran or non -\nVeteran) on all VA loans, including IRRRLs. The one exception to this policy is that \nCAIVRS  is not  required  for non-purchasing spouses in community property states.\nVA assigns a 10-digit VA lender identification number (ID) to each new lender, then \nautomatically  forwards  the ID number to HUD  with a request  to grant the lender CAIVRS \naccess.  The lender can begin accessing CAIVRS usually between 7 to 10 business days after \nreceiving its VA ID number assignment.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 33 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-33Topic 6 : Debts Owed to the Federal Government, continued\nc.What is the Credit Alert Verification Reporting System (CAIVRS), continued \nToregister  for CAIVRS  access for  first time users,  please  use the following link: \nhttps://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/f57register.cfm.\nPlease  direct  questions concerning problems encountered  with accessing CAIVRS to \ncaivrs_admin@hud.gov.\nIf the borrower(s)  is found to have  a delinquent federal  debt through CAIVRS, the  validity  \nand delinquency status  of the debt should be verified  by contacting the creditor agency  using \nthe contact phone number and case number reflected on the borrower’s CAIVRS report.\nThe creditor agency that is owed the debt can verify that the debt has been resolved. \nDocumentation should be included in the loan file and an explanation must  be pro vided on\nVA Form  26-6393 , Loan Analysis . It is not necessary  for CAIVRS to update the number if \ndocumentation is included in the loan file.\nOnce screening is complete, enter the CAIVRS confirmation code on VAForm 26 -6393,\nLoan Analysis , in the space  to the right  of the “no” block in item 46 for purchase and \nrefinances.\nFor IRRRLs,  enter  the code  onVA Form  26-8923, IRRRL Worksheet, in the Notes section.\nd.Borrower with Presently Delinquent Federal Debts  \nWhen  CAIVRS  or another  source  indicates  that the borrower  has a delinquent Federal debt, \nthe following steps must be taken:\n·Suspend processing of the  loan application  to determine  the reason for the non “A” \nnumber.\n·Give full consideration to the CAIVRS information, and any subsequent clarifying \ninformation or documentation provided, in applying VA credit standards.  Any non “A” \nnumber received does not automatically disqualify a Veteran from using their home \nloan benefit; however,  the lender  must  document and justify  the approval. See Topic 7, \nsubsection b of this chapter for documentation and explanation requirements.\n·If a previ ous VA loan is involved that resulted in a debt to the government (due to \nforeclosures,  short sale, deed  in lieu, or other), the borrower  may contact  the VA Debt \nManagement  Center  at 1-800-827- 0648 or at dmc.ops@va.gov to make arrangements \nto repay the debt.\nGenerally,  only type 2 VA loans (fifth  digit of the VA loan number)  result in  a debt to VA \nand are reported.  The Veteran’s entitlement cannot be restored until the debt to VA is paid in \nfull.\nIf the fifth digit of the previous loan number is a type 6 VA loan, there is generally a loss to \nthe government and the loss is not reported to CAVIRS. A loss to VA does not need to be \nrepaid; however, the Veteran’s previously used entitlement to guaranty the previous VA loan \nis not restored until the loss is paid in full.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 34 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-34Topic 6 : Debts Owed to the Federal Government, continued\nd.Borrower with Presently Delinquent Federal Debts, continued \nEach agency has their timeliness requirements before removing a non “A” CAVIRS finding. \nThis does not preclude the Veteran or borrower from receiving a VA loan if credit standards \nare met for VA l oans. See Topic 4.07b (13 and 14) of this Chapter for guidelines after a \nbankruptcy or foreclosure.\nExample : A borrower suffered a loss on a FHA loan home loan 2 years ago. While HUD has \nnot removed the CAIVRS finding as the 3-year waiting period has not p assed for FHA, the \nlender is eligible to continue processing a VA loan without an “A” CAIVRS finding due to \nthe borrower(s) meeting VA credit guidelines for foreclosures and documented in the loan \nfile.\nCAIVRS information is only for the lender’s and borro wer’s use in processing the loan \napplication. Only those persons having responsibility for screening borrowers and/or co-\nborrowers may use CAIVRS. Any other use is unauthorized.\ne.Treatment of Federal Debts  \nA borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she is presently \ndelinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government until the delinquent account \nhas been brought current or satisfactory arrangement have been made between the borrower \nand the Federal agency.\nExample : A borrower has delinquent taxes and payments have not been made for several \nyears. The establishment of a payment plan after the CAVIRS finding has been addressed \nmay not be sufficient to show a satisfactory payment arrangement to repay the obliga tion.\nA borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she has a judgment lien \nagainst his or her property for a debt owed to the Government until the judgment is paid or \notherwise satisfied.\n\n--- PAGE 35 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-35Topic 7: Credit History – Required Docum entation and Analysis\nChange Date : July 27, 2023\n·Subsection b has been updated to include guidance regarding medical collections and \nmedical charge offs . \n·Subsection b has been updated to provide clarity regarding the monthly payment \nconsideration for unpaid medical collection accounts.\na.Credit Report Standards  \nCredit  Reports used in analyzing VA  loans must  be either  Three -file Merged Credit Reports \n(MCR), or Residential Mortgage Credit Reports (RMCR).\nThe credit report must be less tha n 120 -days old (180 days for new construction). For \nautomatically closed loans and prior approval loans, the date  of the credit  report  must  be \nwithin  120 days of the date the note is  signed (180 days for new construction).\nIf an RMCR  is used, the standards applicable  to a RMCR  include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing:\n·The report must be  prepared by a reputable  credit  reporting agency.\n·Each  account with  a balance  must  have  been checked  with the creditor within 90 days \nof the date of the credit  report.\nFor each debt listed,  the report must  provide the creditor’s name,  date the account was  \nopened,  high credit,  current  status,  required  payment, unpaid balance, and payment history.\nThe report must name at least two national repositories of credit records contacted  for each \nlocation  in which the borrower  has resided  during the most recent  2 years  (separate  \nrepository inquiries  are required for  any co -borrowers with individual credit records).\nThe report must include all available public recor ds information that is not considered \nobsolete under the Fair Credit  Reporting Act(15 U.S.C. §  1681) such as bankruptcies, \njudgments, law suits, foreclosures and tax liens.\nThe RMCR  must  be an original  or electronic  report,  with no erasures, whiteouts, or \nalterations.\nThe report  must contain  a 24- mont h employment  and residency  history.\nVA may decline  to accept  a credit  report which does not meet  these  standards.\nIf possible, the cost of the credit  report must  be listed  on the credit  report. If not possible, an \nitemized invoice identifying the borrower(s) is required to verify  the cost on the Closing \nDisclosure  Statement  (CD)  when  charging the borrower for the credit report.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 36 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-36Topic 7 : Credit History – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nb. How to Analyze Credit  \nThe borrower’s past repayment practices on obligations is the best indicator of his or her \nwillingness to repay future obligations. Emphasis should be on the borrower’s overall \npayment patterns rather than isolated occurrences of unsatisfactory repayment. Determine \nwhether the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a \ncareful analysis of the credit report and other credit data.\nVA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.\nRent and Mortgage Payment History\nThe borrower’s most recent 24 -month rental history and any outstanding, assumed, or \nrecently retired mortgages must be verified and rated. Housing expense payment history is \noften a primary indicator of how motivated the borrower is to make timely mortgage \npayments in the future.\nAbsence of Credit History\nFor borrower(s) with no established credit history, base the determination on the borrower’s \npayment record on alternative or nontraditional credit directly from the borrower or creditor \nin which a payment history can be verified.\nAbsence of a credit history is not generally considered an adverse factor.\nIt may result when:\n·borrower(s)  has not yet  developed a credit  history,\n·borrower(s)  has routinely used cash rather  than credit,  and/or\n·borrower(s)  has not used since  some disruptive credit  event  such as bankruptcy or debt \npro-ration through consumer credit counseling.\nAccounts in the Spouse’s Name\nSee Topic 2, subsection c in this chapter for ECOA and consideration of the spouse’s credit \nhistory.\nAdverse Credit Data\nIn circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally considered to be \nre-established after the borrower(s), have made satisfactory payments for 12 months after the \ndate the last derogatory credit item was satisfie d. If a credit report reveals numerous unpaid \ncollections and/or accounts that are not being paid timely, including some which have been \noutstanding for many years, then once the borrower has satisfied the obligations, and then \nmakes timely payments on subsequent obligations for at least 12 months, satisfactory credit \nis considered re -established.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 37 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-37Topic 7 : Credit History – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nb.How to Analyze Credit, continued \nMedical Collection and Charge -off Accounts\nIdentifiable medical collections are collection accounts that are established when an overdue \nmedical bill is referred to a collection agency. Charge -offs may occur when a creditor is no \nlonger pursuing repayment of the medical debt. Le nders may disregard all identifiable \nmedical collections, including charge-off accounts, that have not been reduced to a judgment \nor lien. \nIdentifiable medical collection accounts that have not been reduced to a judgment or lien do \nnot have to be paid off as a condition for loan approval and should not impact the overall \nacceptability of a borrower's credit.\nLenders do not need to obtain explanations for medical collections or charge-offs and do not \nneed to otherwise address such accounts.\nNon- medical Coll ection Accounts \nIsolated non-medical collection accounts do not necessarily have to be paid off as a condition \nfor loan approval. A credit report may show numerous satisfactory accounts and one or two \nunpaid collections. In such instances, while it would be preferable to have collections paid, it \nwould not necessarily be a requirement for loan approval. \nHowever, non- medical collection accounts must be considered part of the borrower’s overall \ncredit history and such accounts should be considered open, recent credit. These unpaid \naccounts must therefore be considered in the debt-to- income ratio and residual income \ncalculation on VA Form 26 -6393, Loan Analysis, and when using an Automated \nUnderwriting System (AUS). If such accounts are listed on the credit report with a minimum \npayment, then the debt should be recognized at the minimum payment amount. \nNon-medical collection accounts without established payment arrangements are to be \nincluded with a calculated monthly payment using 5% of the outstanding bala nce of the \ncollection. Borrowers with a history of such accounts should have re- established satisfactory \ncredit in order to be considered a satisfactory credit risk. \nWhile VA does not require such accounts be paid- off prior to closing if the borrower’s \noverall credit is acceptable, an underwriter must address the existence of the account(s) with \nan explanation on VA Form 26- 6393, Loan Analysis, and justify why positive factors \noutweigh the negative credit history such accounts represent.\nCharge  -off Accou nts\nThese accounts are typically collections in which the creditor is no longer pursuing collection \nof the account. The underwriter must address the circumstances  regarding  the negative  credit  \nhistory when  reviewing the overall credit of the borrower(s). This does not apply to \nidentifiable medical charge -offs, as described above.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 38 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-38Topic 7 : Credit History – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nb.How to Analyze Credit, continued \nDisputed  Accounts\nLenders may consider a Veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses regarding  unpaid debts \nexcept  when the debt has been  reduced to judgment.\nThe underwriter  should document the reason(s)  for not considering an  account on VA Form \n26-6393, Loan Analysis .\nJudgments\nAccount balances  reduced  to judgment by a court  must  either  be paid in full or subject to a \nrepayment plan with a history of timely payments.\nA history of timely  payments would be generally  considered  as making 12 payments to \nreestablish credit.\nHowever, in certain cases when a judgment has only been in place for a few months, an \nunderwriter could justify on VA Form 26-6393 , Loan Analysis , a shorter repayment history if \nthe documentation indicates the borrower immediately  addressed  the judgment  after it was \nfiled and began a repayment plan.\nPayoff of Unpaid or Untimely Debts\nFor unpaid or debts that have not been paid timely, pay- off of these debts after the \nacceptability of a borrower's credit is questioned does not alter the unsatisfactory record of \npayment. A period of making timely payments on subsequent obligations for at least 12 \nmonths, then satisfactory credit is considered re -established.\nConsumer Credit Counseling Plan\nIf a borrower(s) has prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer Cred it \nCounseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk if they demonstrate \n12 months’ satisfactory payments and the counseling agency approves the new credit. If a \nborrower(s) has good prior credit and are participating in a Consumer C redit Counseling \nplan, such participation is to be considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in \ndetermining creditworthiness. Do not treat this as a negative credit item if the borrower \nentered the Consumer Credit Counseling plan before reaching the point of having bad credit.\nBankruptcy\nThe fact that a bankruptcy exists in a borrower (or spouse’s) credit history does not in itself \ndisqualify the loan. Develop complete  information  on the facts and circumstances of the \nbankruptcy. Consider the reasons for the bankruptcy and the type of bankruptcy filing.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 39 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-39Topic 7 : Credit History – Required Documentation and Analysis, continued\nb.How to Analyze Credit, continued \nBankruptcy Filed Under the Straight Liquidation and Discharge Provisions of the \nBankruptcy Law (Petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code):\n·If the bankruptcy was discharged  more  than 2 years  ago from  the date of closing for \npurchases and refinances, it may be disregarded.\n·If the bankruptcy was discharged within the last 1 to 2 years, it is probably not possible \nto determine that the borrower or spouse is a satisfactory  credit  risk unless  both of the \nfollowing requirements  are met:\nTable 3: Requirements for Bankruptcies Discharged within the last 1 to 2 years\nRequirement Explanation\n1 The borrower(s) had obtained consumer items on credit subsequent to  the \nbankruptcy and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued \nperiod.\n2 The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the \nborrower or spouse such as unemployment, prolonged strikes, medical \nbills not covered by insurance, an d so on, and the circumstances  are \nverified.

These systems incorporate VA’s credit standards and processing requirements.\nLenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases processed with \napproved AUS. The level of reduced documentation depends on the risk classification \nassig ned. The systems use different terminology such as Approve or Accept. The tables in \nthis section give a general description of documentation waivers. Please note that the \ndocumentation requirements are the same for these cases as for non -AUS cases, except for \nany differences cited in the tables.\nThe automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans. They merely determine a risk \nclassification. It is still the lenders underwriter’s decision whether or not to approve the loan.\nAlthough VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor. The terms and \nconditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider of these systems.\nIt is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system be accurately \nverified. The data util ized by the system must be supported by source documentation \nobtained by the lender. Inaccurate or unverified data will result in invalidation of the risk \nclassification.

Use a figure of 125 \npercent of the borrower’s non - taxable income when “grossing up.”\n·Do not add non-taxable  income  to taxable  income  before  “grossing up.”\n·If “grossing up” is used, indicate such and provide the “grossed up” ratio of 125 percent \nin item 47, “Remarks.” The actual amounts of the borrower’s non- taxable income \nshould not be adjusted in in line 38.\nc.Past Credit Record – Item 45  \nIndicate whether the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) is a satisfactory or unsatisfactory \ncredit risk based on a complete analysis of credit data.\n\n--- PAGE 53 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-53Topic 10: How to Analyze the Information on VA Form 26 -6393, \nLoan Analysis\nChange Date : February 22, 2019\n·This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  \na.Resi\ndual Income  \nVA’s minimum residual incomes (balance available for family support) are a guide. They \nshould not automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan. Instead, consider residual \nincome in conjunction with all other credit factors.\nHowever, an inadequate residual income alone can be a basis for disapproving a loan.\nIf residual income is marginal, look to other indicators such as the borrower’s credit history, \nand in pa\nrticular, whether and how the borrower has previously handled similar housing \nexpense.\nConsider the ages of the borrower’s dependents in determining the adequacy of residual \nincome.\nb.Debt -to-Income Ratio  \nVA’s  debt-to- income  ratio is a ratio of total monthly  debt payments (housing expense, \ninstallment debts, and other obligations listed in section D of VAForm 26-6393, Loan \nAnalysis , to gross  monthly income. I t is a guide and, as an underwriting factor, it is \nsecondary to the residual income.  It should not automatically trigger approval or rejection of \na loan. Instead, consider the ratio in conjunction with all other credit factors.\nA ratio greater  than 41  percent  requires close  scrutiny unless:\n·the ratio  is greater  than 41 percent  unless  it is larger  due solely  to the existence of tax -\nfree income which should be noted in the loan file), the loan may be approved with \njustification, by the underwriter's supervisor, or\n·residual  income  exceeds the guideline by at  least 20 percent.\nLoans closed automatically  with a debt-to- income  ratio greater  than 41 percent:\n·Include a statement justifying the reasons for approval, signed by the underwriter’s \nsupervisor, unless  residual  income  exceeds the guideline by at least 20 perc ent.\n·The statement must include the reason(s) for approving the loan and list the \ncompensating factors justifying approval of the loan.\nc.Credit History  \nA poor credit history alone is a basis for disapproving a loan.\nIf credit history is marginal, look t o other factors such as residual income .\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 54 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-54Topic 10 : How to Analyze the Information on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, continued\nd. Compensating Factors \nCompensating factors may affect the loan decision. These factors are especially  important  \nwhen  reviewing loans which are marginal  with respect  to residual income or debt-to- income \nratio.  They cannot be used to compensate for unsatisfactory credit.\nValid compensating factors should represent strengths rather than mere satisfaction of basic \nprogram requirements.  For example, the fact that a borrower  has sufficient  assets  for closing \npurposes, or meets  the residual income guideline, is not a compensating factor.\nValid compensating factors should logically be able to compensate (to some extent)  for the \nidentified  weakness  in the loan. For example,  significant  liquid assets may compensate for a \nresidual income shortfall whereas long -term employment would not.\nCompensating factors  include, but are  not limited  to the  following:\n·excellent  credit  history,\n·conservative  use of consumer  credit,\n·minimal  consumer  debt,\n·long- term employment,\n·significant  liquid  assets,\n·sizable  downpayment,\n·the existence  of equity in refinancing  loans,\n·little or no increase  in shelter  expense,\n·milit ary benefits,\n·satisfactory  homeownership experience,\n·high residual  income,\n·low debt-to- income  ratio,\n·tax credits for  child  care,  and\n·tax benefits of home ownership.\ne.Com\npare Previous and Proposed Shelter Expenses  \nClosely scrutinize a case in which the borrower will be paying significantly higher shelter \nexpenses than he or she currently pays.\nConsider the:\n·ability of the borrower to accumulate liquid assets, and\n·amount of debts incurred while paying a less amount for shelter.\nIf a borrower’s application  shows little or no reserves and excessive obligations, it may not \nbe reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in shelter expenses can be absorbed.\nContinued on next page\n\n--- PAGE 55 ---\nVA Lenders Handbook M26 -7\nChapter 4: Credit Underwriting\n4-55Topic 10 : How to Analyze the Information on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, continued\nf.Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)  \nAsa result  of releases  of Home Mortgage  Disclosure  Act(HMDA)  data,  many lenders are \nincreasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate measures  to assure  access  by \nminorities  and lower  income  households to home mortgage loans. VA believes that it is \nimportant for l enders to be aware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist \nthem in meeting this goal.\nCompatibility  of VA Program with  HMDA\nThe no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for individuals with low-to-\nmoderate incomes.  However, lenders should not overlook other aspects  of the VA program  \nthat will help in underwriting loans for such borrowers. VA Credit Standards are written as \nguidelines and are meant  to be interpreted  and used just that way,  taking into consideration all \nof an individual loan borrower’s financial, employment and family circumstances.\nPurpose  of HMDA\nVA encourages underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be \napproved but may not appear  approvable upon  direct  application  of the credit standards.\nUnderwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible appropriate  factor  in \nseeking a proper basis  for approving loan applications  for every qualified Veteran."
