1. Types of Program Approvals  
 
Handbook 4000.1  1 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  I. DOING BUSINESS WITH FHA  
A. FHA LENDERS AND MORTGAGEES  (09/20/2021)  
The Doing Business with FHA section in this FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 
(Handbook 4000.1 ) covers Federal Housing Administration (FHA) approval and eligibility 
requirements for both Title  I Lender s and Title II Mortgagee s, as well as other FHA program 
participants. The term “Mortgagee” is used throughout for all types of FHA approval (both Title 
II Mortgagees and Title I Lenders) and the term “Mortgage” is used for all products (both Title II 
Mortgages and Title I Loans), unless otherwise specified.  
A Mortgagee must fully comply with all of the following approval and eligibility requirements in 
order to be approved by FHA to participate in the origination, underwriting, closing, 
endorsement, servicing, purchasing, holding, or selling of FHA -insured Ti tle I Loans or Title II 
Mortgages  at the time of approval and at all times after approval . 
The requirements outlined below in subsections 1 through 9 apply to both Single Family (one - to 
four-units) and Multifamily Mortgagees. If there are any exceptions or program -specific 
requirements that differ from those set forth below, the exceptions or alternative program 
requirements are explicitly stated or hyperlinked to the appropriate guida nce. Terms and 
acronyms used in this Handbook 4000.1 have their meanings defined in the Glossary and 
Acronyms  and in the specific section of Handbook 4000.1  in which the definitions are located.  
1. Types of Program Approvals  
FHA approves Mortgagees separately for participation in the Title  I and Title II programs. FHA 
approval is conveyed to a specific legal entity and cannot be shared with or extended to other 
entities, such as a parent or subsidiary, or any Affiliates  of the Mortgagee.  
a. Title  I (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Definition  
A Title  I Lender  is a Lender  that (a) holds a valid Title I Contract of Insurance  and is 
approved by FHA  to participate in the Title I program under the National Housing Act 
(12 U.S.C. §  1703 et seq .), or (b) is under suspension or holds a Title I Contract of 
Insurance  that has been terminated or suspended but remains responsible for servicing or 
selling the Title I Loans  that it holds and is authorized to file insurance claims on such 
Title I Loans . 
Title  I Contract of Insurance  is the term applied to a Title I Lender ’s authority to 
originate, underwrite, and insure Title I Loans. FHA’s approval as a Title I Lender 
constitutes the Title I Contract of Insurance between the Title I Lender and HUD.

2. Types of Approved Mortgagees  
 
Handbook 4000.1  2 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  ii. Standard  
A Title  I Lender  may be approved to originate, underwrite, close, endorse, service, 
purchase, hold, or sell Loans under the Property Improvement program and/or the 
Manufactured Housing  program. Unless otherwise specified, Title I Lenders must meet 
the same approval requirements and follow the same procedures as Title II Mortgagee s. 
The FHA Lender ID assigned to the Title  I Lender  by HUD at approval is used to identify 
the Title I Contract of Insurance  in all insurance transactions. The Title I Lender’s 
responsibility under the Title I Contract of Insurance will remain in force for all Title I 
Loans originated under the Title I Contract of Insurance for the entire term of the Title I 
Loans.  
A lender whose Contract is terminated may continue to be approved as a Title  I Lender , 
and it continues to be insured with respect to the Title I Loans it holds at the time of 
termination, but it cannot otherwise exercise the rights of an approved lender. The Title I 
Lender may no longer originate new Title I Loans but will remain responsible to perform 
all duties for Title I Loans held in accordance  with the Title I Lender’s Contract of 
Insurance  with HUD. This includes servicing and paying premium charges when due. 
Claims may be filed for Title I Loans that were insured under the Contract of Insurance.  
b. Title  II (09/14/2015)  
i. Definition  
A Title  II Mortgagee  is a Mortgagee that has been approved to participate in Title II 
and/or Title XI programs under the National Housing Act (12  U.S.C. §  1707 et seq. and 
12 U.S.C. §  1749aaa et seq.).  
ii. Standard  
A Title  II Mortgagee  may be approved to originate, underwrite, close, endorse, service, 
purchase, hold, or sell FHA Single Family insured Mortgages or multifamily Mortgages.

AHPP  refers to a program plan, as described in a written proposal 
submitted to FHA, operated by a nonprofit in specific geographical areas 
in which the nonprofit provides affordable homeownership opportunities 
for Low- to Moderate -Income buyers  by purchasing, rehabilitating , and 
reselling HUD Home s to these buyers. The program can include other 
homeownership activities, such as counseling.

A nonprofit must adhere to its AHPP . Any activity undertaken by a 
nonprofit that requires the use of their FHA nonprofit approval must be in 
accordance with the approved AHPP.  
Unlike the application for approval, a separate AHPP  must be submitted 
to every Jurisdictional HOC for the geographic areas in which the

two differing scores are reported, the MDCS is the lowest score. Where only 
one score is reported, that score is the MDCS.  
An MDCS  is determined for each Borrower . Where the Mortgage  involves 
multiple Borrower s, the Mortgagee  must determine the MDCS  for each 
Borrower , and then select the lowest MDCS  for all Borrower s.  
Where the Mortgage  involves multiple Borrower s and one or more of the 
Borrower s do not have a credit score (non -traditional or insufficient credit), 
the Mortgagee  must select the lowest MDCS  of the Borrower (s) with credit 
score(s).

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (a) Standard  
The Mortgagee  must prevent its staff, or any person who is compensated on a 
commission basis upon the successful completion of a Mortgage , or who 
reports, ultimately, to any officer of the Mortgagee  not independent of the 
mortgage  production staff and process, from having substantive 
communications with an Appraiser  relating to or having an impact on 
valuation, including ordering or managing an appraisal assignment.  Normal 
communications necessary to processing of a case is permissible, but cannot 
attempt t o influence the Appraiser . 
The underwriter who has responsibility for the quality of the appraisal report 
is allowed to request clarifications and discuss with the Appraiser  components 
of the appraisal that influence its quality.  
(b) Exception for Smaller Mortgagees  
When absolute lines of independence cannot be achieved because of the 
Mortgagee ’s small size and limited staff, the Mortgagee  must clearly 
demonstrate that it has prudent safeguards to isolate its collateral evaluation 
process from influence or interference from its mortgage  production process.  
(2) Communications with Third Parties  
The u nderwriter  may request a clarification or reconsideration of value from  the 
Appraiser , following the requirements in Reconsideration of Value . The 
Mortgagee  may not discuss the contents of an appraisal with anyone other than

Handbook 4000.1  173 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  In accordance with 24  CFR §  203.41 (d)(1)(ii), FHA considers a reasonable share of 
appreciation to be at least 50 percent. HUD does not object to affordable housing 
programs whereby the homeowner’s share of appreciation is on a sliding scale beginning 
at zero, provided that within two years  the homeowner would be permitted to retain 50 
percent of the appreciation. If the program sets a maximum sales price restriction, the 
Borrower must be permitted to retain 100 percent of the appreciation.  
A Property  that contains leased equipment, or operates with a leased energy system or 
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) , may be eligible for FHA -insured financing but only 
when such agreements are free of restrictions that prevent the Borrower from freely 
transferring the Property . 
Such agreements are acceptable, provided they do not cause a conveyance (ownership 
transfer) of the insured Property  by the Borrower to:  
• be void, or voidable by a third party;  
• be the basis of contractual liability of the Borrower (including rights of first 
refusal, preemptive rights or options related to a Borrower ’s efforts to convey);  
• terminate or be subject to termination all or part of the interest held by the 
Borrower;  
• be subject to the consent of a third party;  
• be subject to limits on the amount of sales proceeds a Borrower can retain (e.g. , 
due to a lien, “due on sale ” clause, etc.);  
• be grounds for accelerating the insured Mortgage; or  
• be grounds for increasing the interest rate of the insured Mortgage.  
Any restrictions resulting from provisions of the lease or PPA do not conflict with FHA 
regulations unless they include provisions encumbering the Real Property or restrict ing 
the transfer of the Real Property.  
Legal restrictions on conveyance  of Real Property (i.e. , the house ) that could require the 
consent of a third party (e.g. , energy provider, system owner, etc.), include but are not 
limited to, credit approval of a new purchaser before the seller can convey the Real 
Property, unless such provisions may be terminated at the option of, and with no cost to, 
the owner.  
If an agreement for an energy system lease or PPA could cause restriction upon transfer 
of the house , the Property  is subject to impermissible legal restrictions and is generally 
ineligible for FHA insurance.

2. Allowable Mortgage Parameters  
 
Handbook 4000.1  174 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  2. Allowable Mortgage Parameters  
This section provides the basic underwriting standards for Single  Family ( one- to four -units) 
Mortgage s insured u nder the National Housing Act.  When underwriting a Mortgage , the 
Mortgagee  must determine the Borrower ’s creditworthiness, capacity to repay, and available 
capital to support the Mortgage . The Mortgagee  must also examine the Property  to ensure it 
provides sufficient collateral for the Mortgage . 
For each Mortgage  the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) insures, the Mortgagee  must fully 
comply with the following underwriting procedures.  
a. Maximum Mortgage Amount s (11/07/2023 ) 
A Mortgage that is to be insured by FHA cannot exceed the Nationwide Mortgage Limits .  
Under most programs, the maximum Mortgage  is the lesser of the Nationwide  Mortgage  
Limit for the area, or a percentage of the  Adjusted Value. 
For purchase transactions, the Adjusted Value is the lesser of:  
• purchase price less any inducements to purchase ; or 
• the Property Value.  
For refinance transactions:  
• For Propert ies acquired by the Borrower  within 12 months of the case number 
assignment date , the Adjusted Value  is the lesser of:  
o the Borrower ’s purchase price , plus any documented improvements made 
subsequent to the purchase ; or 
o the Property Value.  
• Properties acquired by the Borrower  within 12 months of case number assignment by 
inheritance or through a Gift from a Family Member  may utilize the calculation of 
Adjusted Value  for properties purchased 12 months or greater.  
• For p roperties acquired by the Borrower  greater than or equal to 12 months prior to 
the case number assignment date , the Adjusted Value is the Property Value.  
i. National Housing Act’s Statutory Limits  
The National Housing Act establishes the maximum Mortgage  limits  and the mortgage 
amounts for all FHA mortgage insurance programs.  
ii. Nationwide Mortgage  Limits  [Effective for case numbers assigned on or after 
January 1, 202 3] 
Mortgage limits are calculated based on the median house  prices  in accordance with the 
statute . FHA’s Single Family mortgage limits are set by Metropolitan Statistical Area 
(MSA)  and county and will be published periodically . FHA’s Single Family mortgage 
limits are available by MSA and county , or by downloading a complete listing . FHA 
publishes updated limits effective for each calendar year.

Any requests to change high -cost area Mortgage  limits determined by HUD must be 
received by FHA’s Santa Ana Homeownership Center (HOC) at the address below no 
later than 30 Days from the public ation of the limits each year. Any changes in area 
Mortgage  limits as a result of valid appeals will be retroactively in effect for case 
numbers assigned on or after January 1 of each year.  
Each request to change Mortgage  limits must contain sufficient housing sales price 
data, listing one -family Propert ies sold in an area within the 12-month look-back 
period, November throug h October  of the previous year. Requests should differentiate 
between Single  Family residential Propert ies, and condominiums or coop erative 
housing units.  Ideally, data provided should also distinguish between d istress ed and 
non-distress ed sales.  Requests for a change will only be considered for counties for 
which HUD does not already have home sales transaction data for the calculation of 
Mortgage  limits.  
All requests for local area increases  in all areas  will be handled exclusively by FHA’s

restrictions to mortgage amounts and LTVs are based upon the amount prior to the 
financing of the Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium  (UFMIP ) (Base Loan  Amount ). 
The total mortgage amount may be increase d by the financed UFMIP amount.  
iv. Calculating Maximum Mortgage Amount s on Purchases  
The maximum mortgage amount  that FHA will insure on a specific purchase is calculated 
by multiplying the appropriate LTV percentage by the Adjusted Value.  
In order for FHA to insure this maximum mortgage amount , the Borrower  must make a 
Minimum R equired Investment  (MRI)  of at least 3.5  percent  of the Adjusted Value . 
v. Additions to the Mortgage Amount for Repair and Improvement  
(A) Appraiser Required Repairs  
A Mortgagee  may add repair costs to the sales price before calculating the mortgage 
amount if : 
• the repairs are required by the Appraiser  to meet HUD’s MPR ; 
• the repairs are paid for by the Borrower ; and  
• the sales contract  or addendum identifies the Borrower  as the party 
responsible for payment and completion of the repairs.

obligation to fund the Borrower ’s MRI. It is not sufficient to document that the 
Governmental Entity  has agreed to reimburse the Mortgagee  for the use of funds 
legally belonging to the Mortgagee  to fund the Borrower ’s MRI.  
The Mortgagee  must obtain : 
• a canceled check , evidence of wire transfer or other draw request  showing that 
prior to or at the time of closing the Governmental Entity  had authorized a 
draw of the funds provided toward the Borrower ’s MRI  from the 
Governmental Entity ’s account; or

(directly or indirectly); or  
(3) anyone who is or will be reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by any party

Governmental Entity is originating the insured Mortgage through one of its 
homeownership programs.  
(C) Required Documentation  
Where the Borrower ’s MRI  is provided by someone other than the Borrower , the 
Mortgagee  must also obtain documentation to support the permissible nature of the 
source of those funds.

consistent with HUD’s Interpretive Rule, the Mortgagee  must document that the 
Governmental Entit y incurred prior to or at closing an enforceable legal liability or 
obligation to fund the Borrower ’s MRI. It is not sufficient to document that the 
Governmental Entit y has agreed to reimburse the Mortgagee  for the use of funds 
legally belonging to the Mortgagee  to fund the Borrower ’s MRI.  
The Mortgagee  must obtain : 
• a canceled check , evidence of wire transfer , or other draw request  showing 
that prior to or at the time of closing the Governmental Entit y had authorized a 
draw of the funds provided toward the Borrower ’s MRI  from the 
Governmental Entit y’s account; or 
• a letter from the Governmental Entit y, signed by an authorized official, 
establishing that the funds provided toward the Borrower ’s MRI  were funds 
legally belonging to the Governmental Entit y, when acting in their 
governmental capacity,  at or before closing.

enforceable liability as a result of its agreement to provide the funds toward 
the Borrower ’s MRI ;

enforceable obligation to provide the funds toward the Borrower ’s MRI ; or 
• the Governmental Entit y has, at or before closing, authorized a draw on its 
account to provide the funds toward the Borrower ’s MRI .

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (D) Underwriting  
The Mortgagee  should be as flexible as prudent decision making permits.  
The Mortgagee  is required to make every effort to obtain traditional documentation 
regarding employment, assets, and credit, and must document their attempts. Where 
traditional documentation is unavailable, the Mortgagee  may use alternative 
documentation as outlined below. Where specific requirements are not provided 
below, the Mortgagee  may use alternative documentation that is reasonable and 
prudent to rely upon in underwriting a Mortgage .  
(1) Credit  
For Borrower s with derogatory credit, the Mortgagee  may consider the Borrower  
a satisfactory credit risk if  the credit report indicates satisfactory credit prior to a 
disaster, and any derogatory credit subsequent to the date of the disaster is related 
to the effects of the disaster.  
(2) Income  
If prior employment cannot be verified because records were destroyed by the 
disaster, and the Borrower  is in the same/similar field, then FHA will accept IRS 
Form  W-2s, Wage and Tax Statement , and tax return s from the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) to confirm prior employment and income.  
The Mortgagee  may also include short -term employment obtained following the 
disaster in the calculation of Effective Income.

When a Borrower  is purchasing a new house , the Mortgagee  may exclude the 
Mortgage Payment  on the destroyed residence located in a PDMDA  from the 
Borrower ’s liabilities. To exclude the Mortgage Payment s from the liabilities, the 
Mortgagee  must:  
• obtain information that the Borrower  is working with the servicing 
Mortgagee  to appropriately address their mortgage  obligation; and  
• apply any property insurance proceeds to the Mortgage  of the damaged 
house .

Handbook 4000.1  436 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  For a Streamline Refinance , the EEM Calculator uses the appraised value from the initial 
transaction , contained within FHA Connection records, as the Adjusted Value.  
vi. Maximum Mortgage Amount  
The maximum  final Base Loan Amount  is determined by adding the maximum 
financeable energy package amount to the  initial maximum  Base Loan Amount. For New 
Construction , the cost of the financeable energy package must be subtracted from the 
sales price when computing the Adjusted Value.  
When utilizing an EEM in conjunction with a 203(k)  or Weatherization , the items 
included in the maximum financeable energy package must be excluded from the items 
included when calculating the initial maximum Base Loan Amount  under these programs.  
The maximum FHA Nationwide Mortgage Limit  for an area may be exceeded by the 
maximum financeable  energy package.  
vii. Underwriting  
The Mortgagee  must calculate the Borrower ’s debt ratios using the initial Base Loan 
Amount plus the portion of the Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium  (UFMIP ) 
attributable to the initial Base Loan Amount.  
(A) TOTAL  Mortgage Scorecard  
For purposes of submission to the Technology Open To Approved Lenders  (TOTAL) 
Mortgage Scorecard, the Mortgagee  must utilize the initial Base Loan Amount prior 
to the addition of the financeable energy package . 
If the Mortgagee  obtains an Accept or Approve on a mortgage  application that does not 
include the financeable energy package , FHA will recognize the risk rating from 
TOTAL  Mortgage Scorecard and permit the increase to the Mortgage Payment  without 
re-underwriting or rescoring. The Mortgagee  must provide a form  HUD -92900 -LT, 
without the financeable energy package , showing the qualifying ratios  in the case binder . 
A second form HUD -92900 -LT must be completed by the underwriter showing 
mortgage  amount calculation that includes the financeable energy package , as reflected 
in FHAC . The second form must also be included in the case binder.

reviewed the calculations associated with the energy efficient  improvements and found 
the Mortgage  and the Propert y to be in compliance with FHA ’s underwriting 
instructions.  
viii. Appraisals  
For E xisting and New Construction , the appraisal does not need to reflect the value of the 
energy package that will be added to the Propert y. If the appraisal does include the value 
of the energy package, the val ue must be subtracted from the P roperty Value when 
computing the Adjusted Value . 
On the 203(k) program, the After Improved Value is to be used for the EEM process.  
ix. Cash -Out 
The Borrower  may not receive cash back from the mortgage  transaction. If an excess 
exists, funds must be applied to the principal Mortgage  balance.  
x. Energy Efficient  Mortgage Escrows  
For all Mortgage s on existing Propert ies, except 203(k),  if the energy package items are not 
complete by the time of closing, the Mortgagee  must  establish an escrow account for the 
remaining cost of the energy improvements  in accordance with the Repair Completion 
Escrow Requirement s.  
(A) 203(k)  
If the energy package is part of a Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage , then the 
escrowed amounts of the energy package must be included in the rehabilitation 
escrow account.

i. Overview  
(A) Definition  
A Refinance Transaction is used to pay off  the existing debt or to withdraw equity 
from the Propert y with the proceeds of a new Mortgage  for a Borrower  with legal title  
to the subject Propert y. 
(B) Types of Refinances

limited to specific purposes.  
(2) No Cash -Out 
A No Cash-Out Refinance is a refinance of any Mortgage  in which the mortgage  
proceeds are limited to the purpose of extinguishing the existing debt  and costs 
associated with the transaction . FHA offers three types of no cash -out refinances:  
(a) Rate and Term  
Rate and Term refers to a no cash -out refinance of any Mortgage  in which all 
proceeds are used to pay existing mortgage  liens on the subject Propert y and 
costs associated with the transaction.

Condo minium  Association , the Mortgagee must conduct a review of the recorded 
Declaration and/or recorded Covenants, Conditions, and Restriction s (CC&R) 
which are in place for the association. When conducting the review, the 
Mortgagee must determine whether the recorded Declaration and/or CC&Rs 
require prior approval by the association of any non -purchase money mortgage 
that will encumber the Property. In those situations where such a requirement 
exists, the Mortgagee must obtain the approval of the association in writing prior 
to origination of the HECM.  Documentation concerning this approval must be 
maintained by the Mortgagee and made available to HUD upon request.

Handbook 4000.1  589 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (c) Required Documentation  
(i) HUD Certification Label  
If the appraisal indicates the HUD Certification Label  is missing from the 
Manufactured Housing  unit, the Mortgagee must obtain label verification 
from the  Institute for Building Technology and Safety (IBTS) . 
(ii) PFGMH Certification  
The Mortgagee must obtain a certification by an engineer or architect, who 
is licensed/registered in the state where the Manufactured Home  is 
located, attesting to compliance with the PFGMH.  
The Mortgagee may obtain a copy of the foundation certification from a 
previous FHA -insured Mortgage, showing that the foundation met the 
guidelines published in the PFGMH that were in effect at the time of 
certification, provided there are no alterations and/or observable damage 
to the foundation since the  date of the original certification.  
If the Appraiser notes additions or alterations to the Manufactured 
Housing  unit, the Mortgagee must ensure the addition was addressed in 
the foundation certification.  
If the additions or alterations were not addressed in the foundation 
certification, the Mortgagee must obtain:  
• an inspection by the state administrative agency that inspects 
Manufactured Housing  for compliance; or  
• certification of the structural integrity from a licensed structural 
engineer if the state does not employ inspectors.

an Appraiser relating to or having an impact on valuation, including ordering 
or managing an appraisal assignment. Normal communications necessary to 
processing of a case is permissi ble but cannot attempt to influence the 
Appraiser.  
The underwriter who has responsibility for the quality of the appraisal report 
is allowed to request clarifications and discuss with the Appraiser components 
of the appraisal that influence its quality.  
(b) Exception for Smaller Mortgagees  
When absolute lines of independence cannot be achieved because of the 
Mortgagee’s small size and limited staff, the Mortgagee must clearly 
demonstrate that it has prudent safeguards to isolate its collateral evaluation 
process from influence or interferenc e from its HECM  production process.  
(2) Communications with Third Parties  
The underwriter may request a clarification or reconsideration of value from the 
Appraiser, following the requirements in Reconsideration of Value . The 
Mortgagee may not discuss the contents of an appraisal with anyone other than 
the Borrower.  
(3) Verifying HUD’s Minimum Property Standard s/Minimum Property 
Requirement s 
As the onsite representative for the Mortgagee, the Appraiser provides 
preliminary verification that a Property meets the Property Acceptability Criteria, 
which include HUD’s MPR  or MPS . 
When examination of a Property reveals noncompliance with the Property 
Acceptability Criteria, the Appraiser must note all repairs necessary to make the 
Property comply with HUD’s Property Acceptability Criteria, together with the 
estimated cost to cure.

the requirements in  24 CFR  § 206.45(e) . 
In accordance with 24 CFR  § 203.41(d)(1)(ii) , FHA considers a reasonable share of 
appreciation to be at least 50 percent. HUD does not object to affordable housing 
programs whereby the homeowner’s share of appreciation is on a sliding scale beginning 
at zero, provided that within two years the homeo wner would be permitted to retain 50 
percent of the appreciation. If the program sets a maximum sales price restriction, the 
Borrower must be permitted to retain 100 percent of the appreciation.

3. Allowable Mortgage Parameters  
 
Handbook 4000.1  591 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  A Property that contains leased equipment, or operates with a leased energy system or 
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), may be eligible for FHA -insured financing but only 
when such agreements are free of restrictions that prevent the Borrower from freely 
transferring the Property.  
Such agreements are acceptable, provided they do not cause a conveyance (ownership 
transfer) of the insured Property by the Borrower to:  
• be void, or voidable by a third party;  
• be the basis of contractual liability of the Borrower (including rights of first 
refusal, preemptive rights or options related to a Borrower’s efforts to convey);  
• terminate or be subject to termination all or part of the interest held by the 
Borrower;  
• be subject to the consent of a third party;  
• be subject to limits on the amount of sales proceeds a Borrower can retain (e.g., 
due to a lien, “due on sale” clause, etc.);  
• be grounds for accelerating the insured HEC M; or  
• be grounds for increasing the interest rate of the insured HEC M. 
Any restrictions resulting from provisions of the lease or PPA do not conflict with FHA 
regulations unless they include provisions encumbering the Real Property or restricting 
the transfer of the Real Property.  
Legal restrictions on conveyance  of Real Property (i.e., the house) that could require the 
consent of a third party (e.g., energy provider, system owner, etc.), include but are not 
limited to, credit approval of a new purchaser before the seller can convey the Real 
Property, unless such provisions may be terminated at the option of, and with no cost to, 
the owner.  
If an agreement for an energy system lease or PPA could cause restriction upon transfer 
of the house, the Property is subject to impermissible legal restrictions and is generally 
ineligible for FHA insurance.  
3. Allowable Mortgage Parameters  
The Mortgagee must determine the Borrower’s creditworthiness, financial capacity, and 
available capital to support the HEC M. The Mortgagee must also examine the Property to ensure 
it provides sufficient collateral for the HEC M. 
For each HEC M the FHA insures, the Mortgagee must fully comply with the following 
underwriting procedures.  
a. Maximum  Mortgage Am ount s (04/29/2024)  
A maximum mortgage amount  is not required to be stated in the Mortgage. However, where 
state law requires the Mortgage to reflect a maximum mortgage amount, the Mortgagee must 
use an amount that is at least equal to 150 percent of the Maximum Claim Amount  (MCA).

Handbook 4000.1  592 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  The Mortgagee may not disburse payments which will cause the outstanding loan balance to 
exceed the maximum mortgage amount  stated in the Mortgage after the payment is 
disbursed. If the outstanding mortgage balance reaches the maximum mortgage amount, 
payments to the Borrower would cease. Payments may be reinstated only in the event the 
Borrower executes a modification to the Mortgage.  
For each HECM FHA insures, the Mortgagee must fully comply with the following 
requirements.  
i. National Housing Act’s Statutory Limits  
The National Housing Act establishes the national mortgage limit  for HECMs.  
ii. Nationwide Mortgage  Limits  
The national mortgage limit  for HECMs is governed by the maximum claim amount 
limitation in sections 255(g) and 255(m) of the National Housing Act, which contains 
cross -references to section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 
Act. FHA publishes updated limits effective for each calendar year.  
b. Maximum Claim Amount  (04/29/2024)  
i. Definition  
The Maximum Claim Amount  (MCA) is the lesser of the:  
• appraised value as determined by the Collateral Risk Assessment ; 
• national mortgage limit; or  
• sales contract  price (applicable only to HECM for Purchase).  
ii. Standard  
The Mortgagee must determine the MCA  at origination. When the collateral risk 
assessment determines that a second appraisal  is required, the Mortgagee must use the 
lower of the two appraised values. The IMIP must not be taken into account in the 
calculation of the MCA. Closing cost s must not be taken into account in determining 
appraised value.  
c. Interest Rate Options  (04/29/2024)  
i. Definitions  
Fixed Rate refers to an interest rate that is fixed over the life of the HECM.  
Annually Adjustable Interest Rate refers to an interest rate that adjusts annually with a 2

Handbook 4000.1  593 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  Monthly Adjustable Interest Rate refers to an interest rate that adjusts monthly. The 
maximum lifetime Note rate may not be more than ten percent higher than the initial 
Note rate.  
ii. Standard  
The Mortgagee and Borrower must agree upon the interest rate. The Mortgagee may offer 
a fixed rate HECM and/or an adjustable rate HECM.  
The Mortgagee may only offer a monthly adjustable rate when the Mortgagee also offers 
an annually adjustable rate HECM.  
Periodic adjustments in the Note rate must correspond to the upward and downward 
change in the index, except that downward changes in the current index will not result in 
an index figure that is less than zero.  
The Mortgagee must provide the Borrower with a written explanation of any adjustable 
rate features of a HECM. The explanation must include the following items:  
• circumstances under which the rate may increase;  
• any limitations on the increase and the effect of an increase; and  
• Truth in Lending Act (TILA) pre -loan disclosures.  
d. Principal Limit  (04/29/2024)  
i. Definition s 
Principal Limit  refers to  the maximum amount of proceeds that a Borrower may receive 
from the HECM before any Disbursemen ts are made,  taking into account the age of the 
youngest Borrower or Eligible NBS , the Expected Rate , and the MCA . 
Principal Limit  Factor  refers to a  multiplier supplied by FHA used to calculate the initial 
Principal Limit and is available on the HUD website . 
Expected Average Mortgage Interest Rate  (Expected Rate)  refers to the interest rate used 
to calculate the Principal Limit  at closing . 
Mortgagee’s Margin refers to the amount that is determined by the Mortgagee and is 
added to the index value to compute the Expected Rate  and is the same margin used to 
determine the initial mortgage interest rate (Note rate ) and the periodic adjustments to the 
Note rate.  
Index Type refers to the interest rate index used to  calculate the Expected Rate .

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  ii. Standard  
The Mortgagee is responsible for calculating the Principal Limit  to determine the amount 
of HECM proceeds that will be available to the Borrower. The Principal Limit is 
calculated by multiplying the MCA  by the Principal Limit Factor .  
The Principal Limit  for a fixed rate HECM will increase each month by one -twelfth of 
the sum of the Note interest rate, plus the annual mortgage insurance rate, but no further 
HECM proceeds may be made available to the Borrower to draw against after the 
Borrower’s Advance . 
The Principal Limit  for an adjustable rate HECM will increase each month by one-
twelfth of the sum of the Note interest rate, plus the annual mortgage insurance rate . 
The Mortgagee must ensure the Borrower is given an analysis of the cost of a HECM 
versus the benefits of the HECM in order to make an informed decision pertaining to 
whether a HECM would meet their individual needs.  
iii. Principal Limit  Factor  
The Mortgagee must determine the appropriate Principal Limit  Factor  based on the age of 
the youngest Borrower or Eligible NBS  and the Expected Rate .  
The Mortgagee  must use the Principal Limit  Factor  based on the age of the younge st 
Borrower or Eligible NBS , rounded up to the nearest whole year if the  next birthday is 
less than 183 Days after closing.   
The Mortgagee m ust also calculate the Principal Limit  using the Principal Limit Factor  
based on the age of the youngest Ineligible NBS  solely for the purpose of disclos ing the 
amount of Principal Limit that would have been available under the HECM if they were 
an Eligible NBS . 
The Mortgagee must advise prospective Borrowers and NBS s to discuss with the HECM 
counselor whether Principal Limit  Factors  below 20 percent may improve their financial 
situation, or meet any special needs, and that, given the costs of obtaining the HECM, 
they should give significant consideration to its potential benefits.  
The Mortgagee must use the HECM Principal Limit  Factor  Tables . 
iv. Expected Rate  
For fixed rate HECMs, the Expected Rate  is the same as the Note rate and is set 
simultaneously with the Note rate. See Establishing the Note Rate  for additional 
guidance.

v. Expected Rate  and Mortgagee ’s Margin Lock  In 
(A) Optional Expected Rate  Lock -In Agreement  
Mortgagees, with the agreement of the Borrower, may simultaneously lock  in the 
Expected Rate  and the mortgagee’s margin , if applicable,  at any time between initial 
application and the date of closing.  The lock-in period  starts on the day that the FHA 
case number is assigned  for a period of up to 120 Days . 
When the Expected Rate  and mortgagee’s margin are not simultaneously locked in, 
the Expected Rate and mortgagee’s margin will be set at closing.  
If the Expected Rate  lock-in agreement includes a float down option, the Principal 
Limit  may be recalculated at closing if the Expected Rate in effect on the date of 
closing is now lower than the stated Expected Rate  in the lock -in agreement . 
Mortgagees are not permitted to charge a fee for the lock -in rate  or the float down 
option . 
(B) Expected Rate  Lock -In Extension  
If the initial Expected Rate  lock-in agreement has expired, the Mortgagee may extend 
the previous lock -in period up to an additional 120 Days, with the agreement of the 
Borrower.  
If the initial Expected Rate  lock-in agreement has expired and the Mortgagee has not 
extended the previous lock -in period, the Expected Rate and mortgagee’s margin will 
be set at closing.  
(C) Case Number Transfer and Expected Rate  Lock -In 
When a case number is transferred to a new Mortgagee, the Expected Rate  and 
mortgagee’s margin, if applicable, may be locked in by the new Mortgagee with the 
agreement of the Borrower for a period of up to 120 Days.

inability to manage debt, or Extenuating Circumstances . The Mortgagee must 
document this analysis in the HECM  file. Any explanation or documentation of 
delinquent accounts must be consistent with other information in the file.  
Where the Borrower has not met the requirements for satisfactory credit above, 
and no Extenuating Circumstances  can be documented, the Mortgagee must, at a 
minimum, require a Fully Funded Life Expectancy Set -Aside . 
Where a Fully Funded LESA  is required, Mortgagees must still determine if the 
Borrower’s credit history provides reasonable assurance that the Borrower can 
effectively manage financial obligations even when real estate taxes and insurance 
are paid directly by the Mortgagee through  the LESA . See Final HECM Decision  
for additional information.

impact of the occurrence(s) on the Borrowe r’s finances;  
• that no other actions, directly or indirectly related to the financial 
problem, were ta ken by the Borrowe r that contributed to the 
derogatory incident(s);  
• the likelihood that these circumstances will not recur. In assessing the

consider the impact of the HECM on the Borrowe r’s circumstances 
through the elimination of financial obligations and/or through an 
increase in Borrowe r income; and  
• that the Borrowe r demonstrates financial liquidity through non -HECM 
assets, additional sources of income  not considered in the financial 
assessment , or other documented factors  that enhance their ability to 
endure financial challenges.  
Extenuating Circumstances  may include, but are not limited to:  
• loss of income due to the death or divorce of a spouse that directly 
resulted in late payment of obligations;  
• loss of income due to the Borrower’s or spouse’s unemployment,

• increase in financial obligations due to emergency medical treatment 
or hospitalization for the Borrower or spouse, emergency property 
repairs not covered by homeowners or Flood Insurance , divorce, or 
other causes that directly resulted in late payments of obligations.  
Unemployment as an Extenuating Circumstance  
If a Borrowe r cited loss of income due to unemployment as the cause of late 
payments or other derogatory information, the Mortgagee must document  the 
actual reduction in income  to determine the degree to which the Borrower’s 
ability to meet their financial obligations was impacted . 
The documentation must include the following:  
• the Borrowe r’s documented satisfactory credit and/or property charge 
payment history  prior to being unemployed;

• supporting explanations from the Borrower; and  
• any additional documentation upon which the Mortgagee relied  to

binder . 
i. Final HECM  Decision  (04/29/2024)  
The underwriter is ultimately responsible for making a HECM  decision on behalf of their 
Direct Endorsement  Mortgagee in compliance with HUD requirements.  
In making the final HECM decision, the underwriter must evaluate the results of the financial 
assessment and determine whether, and under what conditions, the Borrower meets FHA 
eligibility criteria.  
To determine whether the HECM represents a sustainable solution for the Borrower’s 
financial circumstances, the underwriter must evaluate whether the Borrower meets Residual 
Income , credit history, and property charge history requirements, including the use of 
Extenuating Circumstances  and Compensating Factors . 
The Mortgagee must not use FHA’s Technology Open To Approved Lenders  (TOTAL) 
Mortgage Scorecard to perform the financial assessment for HECMs.  
i. Duty of Care/Due Diligence  
The underwriter  must exercise the same level of care that would be used in approving a 
HECM entirely dependent on the Property as security. Compliance with FHA 
requirements is deemed to be the minimum standard of due diligence required in 
originating and underwriting an FHA -insured HEC M. 
ii. Specific Underwriter  Responsibilities  
The underwriter  must review each HEC M as a separate and unique transaction, 
recognizing that there may be multiple factors that demonstrate a Borrower’s ability and 
willingness to meet their financial obligations and comply with the terms of the HECM.

impact of layering risks on the probability that a Borrower will be able to meet their 
financial obligations and comply with the terms of the HECM . 
As the responsible party, the underwriter  must:  
• review appraisal reports, compliance inspections, and credit analyses to ensure 
reasonable conclusions, sound reports, and compliance with HUD requirements 
regardless of who prepared the documentation;  
• determine the acceptability of the appraisal, the inspections, the Borrower’s  
ability to  meet their financial obligations and comply with the terms of the 
HECM , and the overall acceptability of the HEC M for FHA insurance;  
• identify any inconsistencies in information obtained by the Mortgagee in the

and document the inconsistencies and their resolutions of the inconsistencies in 
the file.  
The underwriter  must identify and report any misrepresentations, violations of HUD 
requirements, and fraud to the appropriate party within their organization.  
iii. Credit and Property Charge  Payment History  
The underwriter  must determine the creditworthiness of the Borrower, which includes 
analyzing the Borrower’s overall pattern of credit behavior and the credit report . See 
Credit History Review Requirements  and Property Charge  Payment History Review 
Requirements . 
The lack of traditional credit history or the Borrower’s decision to not use credit may  not 
be used as the basis for rejecting the HECM  application.  
Where the Borrowe r’s credit and/or property charge payment history does not meet the 
criteria described in Satisfactory Credit History  and Satisfactory Property Charge  
Payment History , the Mortgagee must either document Extenuating Circumstances , or 
require a Fully Funded LESA . 
Compensating Factors  cannot be used to compensate for any derogatory credit.  
The underwriter  must ensure that there are no other unpaid obligations incurred in 
connection with the HECM  transaction.  
iv. Monthly Expenses  
The underwriter must calculate the Borrower’s monthly expenses and verify that they 
have been supported with proper documentation. See Monthly Expense Analysis . 
v. Effective Income  
The underwriter must review the income of a Borrower and verify that it has been 
supported with the proper documentation . See Effective Income Analysis . 
vi. Residual  Income  
The underwriter must calculate the Borrower’s Residual Income  and verify that it is 
supported with proper documentation . See Residual Income Analysis .

Handbook 4000.1  683 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  vii. Life Expectancy  Property Charges  
(A) Definitions  
Projected Life Expectancy Property Charge s refer to the amount of HECM proceeds 
necessary to pay property taxes, Hazard Insurance , and Flood Insurance , if applicable, 
based on the life expectancy of the youngest Borrower.  
Life Expectancy Set -Aside  (LESA) refers to a Set -Aside  account that is established 
for the payment of property taxes, Hazard Insurance , and, if applicable, Flood 
Insurance  until expended or while the HECM is not in Due and Payable  status. LESA 
funds cannot be held in an escrow account.  
Property Charge  Set-Aside  refers to a portion of a Borrower’s Principal Limit  that is 
designated for payment of Property Charges. A Property Charge Set -Aside  can result 
from a Borrower being required to establish a Life Expectancy Set -Aside  (LESA) or 
when a Borrower elects to have the Mortgagee pay Property Charges on their behalf.  
Fully Funded Life Expectancy Set -Aside  (LESA ) refers to a portion of the 
Borrower’s Principal Limit  that is designated for payment of property taxes,  including 
special assessments levied by municipalities or state law , Hazard Insurance , and, if 
applicable, Flood Insurance  for the estimated remainder of the Borrower’s life 
expectancy. With a Fully Funded LESA, the Mortgagee makes payments directly to 
the billing agency. A Borrower can voluntarily elect to have a Property Charge  Set-
Aside  created at closing. If the Borrower chooses this option, the Property Charge 
Set-Aside  will function as though it were a Fully Funded LESA.  
Partially Funded Life Expectancy Set -Aside  (LESA ) refers to a portion of the 
Borrower’s Principal Limit  that is designated for partial payment of property taxes, 
Hazard Insurance , and, if applicable, Flood Insurance  for the estimated remainder of 
the Borrower’s life expectancy. With a Partially Funded LESA, the Mortgagee makes 
payments to the Borrower who is responsible for the remaining amounts owed and 
delivering the full payment to the billing agency.  
(B) Standard  
The underwriter must calculate the Projected Life Expectancy Property Charges  for 
all HECMs, regardless of whether a LESA  is required or not. The underwriter must 
determine if the Borrower is required to use HECM proceeds to pay for Property 
Charges  from a Fully Funded or Partially Funded LESA .  
Whe re the Mortgagee will pay Property Charges  from a Fully Funded LESA , there 
will be an effective reduction in the Borrower’s monthly expenses.  Where the amount 
of Property Charges to be paid through the Fully Funded LESA  is such that the 
Borrower will still fall significantly short of the Residual Income  standard, the 
approval of a HECM, even with a Fully Funded LESA, may not represent a 
sustainable solution for the Borrower’s financial circumstances.

Handbook 4000.1  684 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (1) Fully Funded LESA  
Where the Mortgagee determines the Borrower has not demonstrated the 
willingness to meet their financial obligations as stated in Satisfactory Credit 
History  and Satisfactory Property Charge  Payment History  and no Extenuating 
Circumstances  can be documented, the Mortgagee must, at a minimum, require a 
Fully Funded LESA . 
Through the Fully Funded LESA  the Mortgagee will use HECM proceeds to pay 
property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of the Borrower. The Borrower 
remains responsible for timely payment of all other Property Charges . 
(2) Partially Funded LESA  
Where the Mortgagee determines the Borrower has demonstrated the willingness 
to meet their financial obligations as stated in Satisfactory Credit History  and 
Satisfactory Property Charge  Payment History  but does not meet the Residual 
Income  Standard  and no Compensating Factors  can be documented, the 
Mortgagee must, at a minimum, require a Partially Funded LESA .  
The Mortgagee must determine whether the Partially Funded LESA  will provide 
sufficient funds that will result in the Borrower m eeting the Residual Income  
standard.  If the establishment of the Partially Funded LESA  will not result in the 
Borrower meeting the Residual Income standard, then the HECM is not a 
sustainable solution.  
A Partially Funded LESA  is not required if the Borrower voluntarily requests a 
Fully Funded LESA . 
If the amount of the Partially Funded LESA  is greater than 75 percent of the 
Projected Life Expectancy Property Charge s, a Fully Funded LESA  must be 
required . 
Through the Partially Funded LESA , the Borrower will receive semiannual 
payments from HECM proceeds to pay property taxes and insurance premiums. 
The Borrower remains responsible for timely payment of all Property Charges . 
(3) Voluntary Fully Funded LESA  
If a Partially or Fully Funded LESA  is not required, the Borrower may voluntarily 
request a Fully Funded LESA  to pay their property taxes and insurance premiums. 
If a Partially Funded LESA  is required, the Borrower may voluntarily re quest a 
Fully Funded LESA. See Voluntary Property Charge  Funding Options .

Handbook 4000.1  685 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (4) Calculation for Projected Life Expectancy Property Charges  
Mortgagees must calculate Projected Life Expectancy Property Charges  for each 
HECM using:  
• 120 percent of the projected sum of:  
 current property taxes ; 
 Hazard Insurance  premiums ; and  
 Flood Insurance  premiums ; 
• the HECM Expected Rate ; 
• the annual MIP  rate; and 
• the life expectancy of the youngest Borrower , with the Borrower age 
rounded up to the nearest whole year if the next birthday is less than 183 
Days after the estimated date of  closing . 
The formula used to calculate Projected Life Expectancy Property Charges  is: 
{1.2 × (PC ÷12 )} × {(1 +  c)m+1 ‒ (1 +  c)} ÷ {c × (1 +  c)m } 
PC (Property Charges ) divided by 12 is the current total monthly Property Charge 
for property taxes, Hazard Insurance , and Flood Insurance . 
The current total monthly Property Charge  is multiplied by 1.2 to take into 
account expected increases in property taxes and Hazard and Flood Insurance  
over the life expectancy of the youngest Borrowe r. 
c is the monthly compounding rate which is defined as the Expected Rate plus the 
annual MIP  rate divided by 12. The Expected Rate must be the same rate that is 
used to determine the Principal Limit . 
m is the Total Annual Loan Cost ( TALC ) life expectancy in total years of the 
youngest Borrowe r, with the Borrower age rounded up to the nearest whole year 
if the next birthday is less than 183 Days after the estimated date of closing , 
multiplied by  12 (e.g., for a 74 -year-old Borrowe r whose birthday is more than 
183 Days after the estimated date of closing, TALC life expectancy is 12 years 
multiplied by  12 months , which  equals  144).  
(5) Calculation for Fully Funded LESA  
The formula to calculate the amount of the Fully Funded LESA  is the same as the 
Projected Life Expectancy Property Charge s. 
(6) Calculation for Partially Funded LESA  
The formula used to calculate the amount of a Partially Funded LESA  is: 
(1.2 × MRIS) × {(1 +  c)m+1 ‒ (1 + c)} ÷ {c × (1 + c )m}

Handbook 4000.1  686 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  Monthly Residual Income  Shortfall  (MRIS ) is the difference between the 
Borrower’s monthly Residual Income and the applicable amount of Residual 
Income for the Borrower’s geographic region and family size, based on the Table 
of Residual Incomes by Region . 
m is the TALC life expectancy in total years of the youngest Borrowe r, with the 
Borrower age rounded up to the nearest wh ole year if the next birthday is less 
than 183 Days after the estimated date of closing , multiplied by 12 (e.g., for a 75 -
year-old Borrower  whose birthday is less than 183 Days from the estimated date 
of closing, TALC life expectancy  equals 132, which  is 11 years multiplied by 12 
months) . 
c is the monthly compounding rate which is defined as the Expected Rate plus the 
annual MIP  rate divided by 12. The Expected Rate must be the same rate that is 
used to determine the Principal Limit . 
The MRIS  is multiplied by 1.2 to take into account expected increases in property 
taxes and Hazard and Flood Insurance  over the life expectancy of the youngest 
Borrowe r. 
(7) Life Expectancy Set -Aside  Growth Rate  
All LESA s increase each month at a rate equal to one -twelfth of the sum of the 
Note rate plus the annual MIP rate from the date the loan is funded.  
The LESA  amount is determined at origination and the remaining LESA  balance 
is adjusted monthly by applying the following formula :   
𝐿𝐸𝑆𝐴  𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡 ℎ= 𝐿𝐸𝑆𝐴  𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟  𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡 ℎ(1+𝑑)−𝑇𝑀𝐿𝐷  
𝑑= (𝑁𝑜𝑡𝑒  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 +𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙  𝑀𝐼𝑃 )
12 
LESA  Balance current month  is the LESA balance in the current month.  
LESA  Balance prior month is the LESA balance in the prior month.  
d is the LESA  growth rate, which is one-twelfth of the sum of the Note rate  plus 
the annual MIP rate. 
TMLD is the  LESA  monthly distribution in the current month.

• elect to be responsible for independent payment of all Property Charges . 
For fixed rate HECMs, i f the Mortgagee does not require a  LESA , the Borrower 
must inform the Mortgagee of the manner in which to pay Property Charges . The 
Borrower may:  
• elect to have a Fully Funded LESA ; or 
• elect to be responsible for independent payment of all Property Charges . 
The Borrower may not cancel any voluntary election property charge payment 
option. If the HECM proceeds are insufficient to pay Property Charges , the 
Borrower must  pay all Property Charges, even though the Borrower elected 
payment to be made by the Mortgagee.  For additional Property Charge Set -Aside  
requirements, see Property Charge Set -Aside  in the HECM Servicing and Loss 
Mitigation  section.  
(C) Required Documentation

x. Servicing Fees  
(A) Definitions  
Servicing Fee refers to the monthly amount charged by the Mortgagee when the cost 
of servicing is not included in the Note rate.  
Servicing Fee Set -Aside  refers to an amount withheld from the HECM  proceeds for 
the payment of  the monthly servicing fee.

Handbook 4000.1  689 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (B) Standard  
The maximum servicing fee that may be charged on a fixed rate or an annually 
adjustable r ate HECM is $30 per month. The maximum  servicing fee that may be 
charged on  a monthly  adjustable rate HECM is $35 per month . 
If the Mortgagee  chooses to ass ess a servicing fee, they must establish a Servicing 
Fee Set -Aside  based on payment of the monthly servicing fee calculated for the life 
expectancy of the youngest Borrower or Eligible NBS , if applicable.  
Formula for Servicing Fee  
Sk = FEE × [(1+i)(m+1) – (1+i)] / [i × (1+i)m] 
Sk is the Servicing Fee S et-Aside required in the kth month of the HECM , where k at 
time of loan origination is equal to 1, for future payment of flat monthly loan 
servicing fees from the Borrower’ s account, and this amount is constant for the entire 
month .  
i is the monthly compounding rate calculated as one -twelfth of the sum of the 
mortgage interest rate (Note rate) and the annual MIP  rate.  
m is the number of remaining months that the servicing fee could be collected, i.e., 
the remaining term on a tenure mortgage in the kth month of the HECM :  
m = 12 × (100 – Borrower’ s Age) – k + 1  
Borrower’s Age is the Borrower’s age used to calculate the Principal Limit , and FEE 
is the monthly loan servicing fee charged to the Borrower’s account.  
Where loan servicing charges are included in the mortgage interest rate (Note rate) 
and are paid as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance, then FEE is zero, and 
the calculation of Sk results in a zero Set -Aside  amount for all months.  
For all other cases, the Servicing Fee Set -Aside , Sk, will decrease as k increases, 
reaching zero for:  
k = 12 × (100 – Borrower’s Age)  
xi. Borrower Approval or Denial

Handbook 4000.1  694 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (B) Standard  
The Mortgagee must calculate the Principal Limit  at closing if there is no lock -in 
agreement.  In accordance with the lock -in agreement terms and conditions, if the 
lock-in agreement includes a float down option, the Mortgagee may recalculate the 
Principal Limit if the Expected Rate  in effect on the date of closing has declined and 
is now lower than the Expected Rate used for the lock -in agreement.  
The Mortgagee  is not permitted to charge a fee for recalculating the Principal Limit . 
The Mortgagee must  verify the Principal Limit  Factor  is based on the age of the 
youngest Borrower or Eligible NBS , rounded up to the nearest whole year if the next 
birthday is less than 183 Days after closing.  
v. Establishing the Note Rate  
The Mortgagee must use indices in effect on the date of closing to calculate the first year 
accrual rate.  For adjustable interest rate HECMs, the Mortgagee must use the same 
mortgagee’s  margin that was used to calculate  the Principal Limit  amount for the initial

Presidentially -Declared Major Disaster Area s 
(A) Standard  
All Properties with HECMs pending closing in areas under a Presidentially -Declared 
Major Disaster Area  (PDMDA) designated for individual assistance must have an 
onsite damage inspection  report that identifies and quantifies any dwelling damage, 
which includes interior and exterior photographs. The damage inspection report must 
be completed by an FHA Roster Appraiser even if the inspection shows no damage to 
the Property, and the report must be dated after the Incident Period (as defined by 
FEMA ) or 14 Days from the Incident Period start date, whichever is earlier . If the 
effective date of the appraisal is on or after the date required above for an inspection, 
a separate damage inspection report is not necessary.  
FHA does not require the Appraiser to ensure utilities are on at the time of this 
inspection if they have not yet been restored for the area.  
Damage inspection s should be completed by the original Appraiser. However, if the 
original Appraiser is not available, another FHA Roster Appraiser in good standing 
with geographic competence in the affected market may be used. If the Mortgagee 
uses a different Appraiser t o inspect the Property, the Appraiser performing the 
damage inspection must be provided with a complete copy of the original appraisal.  
All damages must be repaired by licensed contractors or according to  local 
jurisdictional requirements. All damages, regardless of amount, must be repaired and 
the Property restored to pre -loss condition with appropriate and applicable 
documentation.  
Based on the damage amount, repairs may be:  
• completed prior to closing; or  
• completed after closing provided that required repairs are included in a Repair 
Rider, if sufficient funds are available for a Repair Set -Aside , and repair costs 
do not exceed permissible thresholds. See Pending HECM Closing table.

i. Standard  
All Properties with HECMs pending endorsement in areas under a PDMDA  designated 
for individual assistance must have an onsite damage inspection  report that identifies and 
quantifies any dwelling damage, which includes interior and exterior photographs. The 
damage inspection report must be completed by an FHA Roster Appraiser even if the 
inspection shows no damage to the Property, and the report m ust be dated after the 
Incident Period (as defined by  FEMA ) or 14 Days from the Incident Period start date, 
whichever is earlier . If the effective date of the appraisal is on or after the date required 
above for an inspection, a separate damage inspection report is not necessary.  
FHA does not require the Appraiser to ensure utilities are on at the time of this inspection 
if they have not yet been restored for the area.  
Damage inspection s should be completed by the original Appraiser. However, if the 
original Appraiser is not available, another FHA Roster Appraiser in good standing with 
geographic competence in the affected market may be used. If the Mortgagee uses a 
different Appraiser t o inspect the Property, the Appraiser performing the damage 
inspection must be provided with a complete copy of the original appraisal.  
All damages must be repaired by licensed contractors or according to local jurisdictional 
requirements. All damages, regardless of amount, must be repaired and the Property 
restored to pre -loss condition with appropriate and applicable documentation.  
Based on the damage amounts shown in the  Pending HECM Endorsement table  below , 
repairs may be:  
• completed prior to submitting for endorsement; or  
• completed after endorsement provided that a repair escrow is established, and 
repair costs do not exceed permissible thresholds.  
The terms and conditions of establishing a repair escrow are not under FHA’s purview 
and must be negotiated between the Borrower and Mortgagee.  
ii. Required Documentation  
Mortgagees must include the initial damage inspection  report in the case binder  for all

(4) IMIP due=min
x≥0(IMIP limit ,IMIP new) 
IMIP new is calculated by multiplying the new IMIP rate by the new MCA  of the 
property being refinanced.  
For HECMs being refinanced for the first time, IMIP old is calculated by multiplying 
the original IMIP rate by the original MCA  of the property being refinanced.  
For HECMs previously refinanced, IMIP old is calculated by multiplying the prior 
IMIP rate by the prior MCA  of the property being refinanced, then subtracting IMIP 
credit previously applied.  
IMIP limit is calculated by multiplying 0.03 by the difference between the new MCA  
and old MCA, then subtracting the value calculated for IMIP old. 
IMIP due is the lesser of IMIP limit or IMIP new, but cannot be less than zero.  
If IMIP paid on the existing HECM is greater than the new IMIP due, there will be no 
refunds. No additional credit is given for the IMIP paid on the last HECM transaction.  
(C) Calculation of Monthly Mortgage Insurance Premium  
Mortgagees must use the formula of one-twelfth of 0.50 percent multiplied by  the 
outstanding mortgage balance to calculate the  monthly Mortgage Insurance Premium  
(MIP). The amount of the annual MIP  will begin to accrue on the outstanding 
mortgage balance from the day after the expiration of the rescission period . 
c. Condominiums  (04/29/2024)

additional requirements contained in the Property Acceptability Criteria for Manufactured 
Housing for Title  II Insured Mortgages  section.  This section also provides requirements for

If the subject of an appraisal contains two or more legally conforming platted lots 
under one legal description and ownership, and the second vacant lot is capable of 
being divided and/or developed as a separate parcel where such a division will not 
result  in a nonconformity in zoning  regulations for the remaining improved lot, the 
second vacant lot is Excess Land . The value of the second lot must be excluded from 
the final value conclusion of the appraisal and the Appraiser must provide a value of 
only the principal site and improvements under a hypothetical condition.  
vii. Characteristics of Property Improvements

ceiling heights, and other houses that in the Appraiser’s professional opinion, are 
unique.  
(2) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must provide a comment that the nonstandard house style appears 
structurally sound and readily marketable and must apply appropriate techniques 
for analysis and evaluation. In order for such a Property to be fully marketable, 
the Appraiser mu st demonstrate that it is located in an area of other similar types 
of construction and blend in with the landscape.  
The Appraiser may require additional education, experience, or assistance for 
these types of Properties.  
(D) Modular Housing  
(1) Definition  
Modular Housing  refers to Structures constructed according to state and local 
codes off -site in a factory, transported to a building lot, and assembled by a 
contractor into a finished house. Although quality can vary, all of the materials –

living unit, including kitchen, sleeping, and bathroom facilities.  
(2) Required Analysis and Reporting  
As part of the highest and best use analysis, the Appraiser must make the 
determination to classify the Property as a Single Family dwelling with an ADU , 
or a two -family dwelling. The conclusion of the highest and best use analysis will 
then determine the classification of the Property and the analysis and reporting 
required.  
An ADU  is usually subordinate in size, location and appearance to the primary 
Dwelling Unit and may or may not have separately metered utilities or separate 
means of ingress or egress. The Appraiser must not include the living area of the 
ADU in the calculation of the Gross Living Area  (GLA) of the primary dwelling.  
The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency in MPR  or MPS  if 
more than one ADU  is located on the subject Property.  
The Appraiser must measure the Contributory Value of the ADU  by applying 
techniques based on one or more of the recognized three approaches to value: cost 
approach, income approach, and sales comparison approach.  
(F) Additional Manufactured Home  on Property  
The Appraiser may consider a Manufactured Home  to be an ADU  if it meets the 
highest and best use and FHA requirements.  
The Appraiser may value a Manufactured Home  on the Property that physically or 
legally may not be used as a dwelling and does not pose any health and safety issues 
by its continued presence as a storage unit.

i. Definition  
Gross  Living Area  (GLA) refers to the total area of finished, above -grade residential 
space calculated by measuring the outside perimeter of the Structure. It includes only 
finished, habitable, above -grade living space.  
ii. Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must:  
• identify noncontiguous living area and analyze its effect on functional utility;  
• ensure that finished basements and unfinished attic areas are not included in the 
total GLA ; and  
• use the same measurement techniques for the subject and comparable sales, and 
report the building dimensions in a consistent manner.  
When any part of a finished level is below grade, the Appraiser must report all of that 
level as below -grade finished area, and report that space on a different line in the 
appraisal report, unless the market considers it to be Partially Below -Grade Habita ble 
Space . 
In the case of nonstandard Properties and floor plans, the Appraiser must observe, 
analyze, and report the market expectations and reactions to the unique Property.  
The Appraiser may apply a supplemental measurement standard if it does not conflict 
with these requirements and the Appraiser discloses the use of the standard.  
iii. Additions and Converted Space  
The Appraiser must treat room additions and garage conversions as part of the GLA  of 
the dwelling, provided that the addition or conversion  space:  
• is accessible from the interior of the main dwelling in a functional manner;  
• has a permanent and sufficient heat source; and  
• was built in keeping with the design, appeal, and quality of construction of the 
main dwelling.  
Room additions and garage conversions that do not meet the criteria listed above are to 
be addressed as a separate line item in the Sales Comparison Approach (SCA) G rid, not 
in the GLA . The Appraiser must address the impact of inferior quality garage conversions 
and room additions on marketability as well as Contributory Value , if any.  
The Appraiser must analyze and report differences in functional utility when selecting 
comparable properties of similar total GLA  that do not include converted living space. If 
the Appraiser chooses to include converted living spaces as GLA, the Appraiser must 
include an explanation detailing the composition of the GLA reported for the comparable 
sales, functional utility of the sub ject and comparable properties, and market reaction.

separate line within the SCA Grid,  including the functional utility line to demonstrate 
market reaction.  
The Appraiser must not add an ADU  or secondary living area to the GLA . 
iv. Partially Below -Grade Habitable Space  
(A) Definition  
Partially Below -Grade Habitable Space  refers to living area constructed partially 
below grade, but has the full utility of GLA . 
(B) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must report the design and measurements of the subject, the market 
acceptance or preference, how the levels and areas of the dwelling are being 
calculated and compared, and the effect that this has on the analysis.  
Regardless of the description of the rooms, bedrooms or baths as above grade or 
below grade, the Appraiser must analyze all components of the subject Property in the 
valuation process.  
v. Bedrooms  
The Appraiser must not identify a room as a bedroom that cannot accommodate ingress 
or egress in the event of an emergency, regardless of location above or below grade.  
d. Appliances  (09/14/2015)

cleaning is required. Swimming pools must be operational to provide full Contributory 
Value.  
The Appraiser must condition the appraisal report for pools with unstable sides or structural 
issues to be repaired or permanently filled in accordance with local guidelines, and the 
surrounding land regraded if necessary.  
If the swimming pool has been winterized, or the Appraiser cannot determine if the pool is in 
working order, the Appraiser must complete the appraisal with the extraordinary assumption 
that the pool and its equipment can be restored to full operating condi tion at normal costs.  
f. Utilities  – Mechanical Components  (02/16/2021 ) 
The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee if mechanical systems do not appear:  
• to have reasonable future utility, durability, and economy;  
• to be safe to operate;  
• to be protected from destructive elements; or  
• to have adequate capacity.  
The Appraiser must observe the physical condition of the plumbing, heating and electrical 
systems. The Appraiser must operate the applicable systems and observe their performance. 
If the systems appear to be damaged or do not appear to function properly, t he Appraiser 
must condition the appraisal for repair or further inspection.  
If the Property is vacant, the Appraiser must note in the report whether the utilities were on 
or off at the time of the appraisal.  
If the utilities are off at the time of the inspection, the Appraiser must ask to have them 
turned on and complete all requirements under Mechanical Components . However, if it is not 
feasible to have the utilities turned on, then the appraisal must be completed without the 
utilities turned on or the mechanical systems functioning.  
If the utilities are not on at the time of observation and the systems could not be operated, the 
Appraiser must:  
1. render the appraisal as subject to reobservation;  
2. condition the appraisal upon further observation to determine if the systems are in 
proper working order once the utilities are restored; and  
3. complete the appraisal under the extraordinary assumption that utilities and 
mechanical systems, and appliances are in working order.  
The Appraiser must note that the reobservation may result in additional repair requirement s 
once all the utilities are on and fully functional.  
If systems could not be operated due to weather conditions, the Appraiser must clearly note 
this in the report. The Appraiser should not operate the systems if doing so may damage 
equipment or when outside temperatures will not allow the system to operate.

Market Value  refers to the most probable price which a Property should bring in a 
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer 
and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not 
affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale 
as of a specified date and the passing of title  from seller to buyer under conditions 
whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well 
informed or well advised, and each acting in what they consider their own best 
interest; (3) a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) 
payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms of financial 
arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal 
consideration for t he Property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or 
Sales Concession s granted by anyone associated with the sale.

Handbook 4000.1  843 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or 
Sales Concession s. No adjustments are necessary for those costs, which are normally 
paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are readily 
identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special 
or cre ative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable Property by 
comparisons to financing terms offered by a third -party institutional lender that is not 
already involved in the Property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be 
calculated on a mec hanical dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but 
the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market’s reaction to the 
financing or concessions based on the Appraiser’s judgment.  
(B) Standard  
The Appraiser must determine the Market Value  of the subject Property.  
(C) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must analyze all data researched and collected prior to reporting the 
value.  The Appraiser must include all components of the real estate in the analysis.

(A) Definition  
Appraisal Condition s refer to anything the Appraiser requires to occur or be known 
before the value of conclusion can be considered valid.  
(B) Standard  
Conclusions about the observed conditions of the Property provide the rationale for 
the opinion of Market Value . 
The completed appraisal form, together with the required exhibits, constitutes the 
reporting instrument for FHA -insured Mortgages. Conditions of the Property, 
mortgage type and the market will determine if the appraisal is to be performed as -is, 
or if the value opinion needs to be conditioned upon an extraordinary assumption(s), a 
hypothetical condition(s), subject to an additional inspection, or completion of 
construction, repairs or alterations.  
(C) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must state in the appraisal report whether repairs, alterations or 
inspections are necessary to eliminate conditions threatening the continued use, 
security, and marketability of the Property.

• income approach to value.  
(B) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must obtain credible and verifiable data to support the application of 
the three approaches to value.  
The Appraiser must perform a thorough analysis of the characteristics of the market, 
including the supply of properties that would compete with the subject and the 
corresponding demand.

and report the results of that analysis.  
(C) FHA Data Requirements for the Subject and Comparable Properties  
The Appraiser must verify the characteristics of the transaction (such as sale price, 
date, seller concessions, conditions of sale) and the characteristics of the comparable 
property at the time of sale through reliable data sources.  
The Appraiser must verify transactional data via public records and the parties to the 
transaction: agents, buyers, sellers, Mortgagees, or other parties with relevant 
information. If the sale cannot be verified by a party to the transaction, the Appraiser  
may rely on public records or another verifiable impartial source.  
MLS records and property site visits alone are not acceptable verification sources.  
(D) Effective Age and Remaining Economic Life  
(1) Standard  
The effective age reflects the condition of a Property relative to similar 
competitive properties. The effective age may be greater than, less than, or equal 
to the actual age. Any significant difference between the actual and effective ages 
requires an ex planation.  
(2) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must state the remaining economic life as a single number or as a 
range for all property types, including condominiums. The Appraiser must 
provide an explanation if the remaining economic life is less than 30 years.  
The Appraiser must apply the appropriate technique to estimate the economic life 
of the subject and not just report a number without analysis.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (E) Approaches to Value  
The Appraiser must consider and attempt all approaches to value and must develop 
and reconcile each approach that is relevant.  
(1) Cost Approach to Value  
The Appraiser may use any of the credible and recognized methods to complete 
the cost approach (unit in place, segregated costs, price per unit, detailed builder’s 
cost method, or any other credible source that can be duplicated by the reader).  
If the Appraiser uses cost estimate s provided by the contractor or builder of the 
Property, the cost estimates must be reasonable and independently verified.  
(a) Land Valuation  
(i) Standard  
If the cost approach is applicable, the Appraiser must estimate the site 
value. Acceptable methodology used to estimate land value include sales 
comparison, allocation, and extraction.  
(ii) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must include a summary of the supporting documentation 
and analysis in the appraisal. The Appraiser must maintain comparable 
land sales data and analysis or other supporting information in the 
Appraiser’s file and include it by reference in t he appraisal. For Properties 
with Excess Land , the Appraiser must include all comparable land sale 
data and analysis in the report.  
(b) Estimate of Cost New for Housing  
(i) Standard  
The Appraiser may use either the replacement cost or the reproduction 
cost. 
(ii) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must state the method used and the source of the data.  
The Appraiser must use the current version of a published cost data source 
recognized by the industry. The Appraiser must report the quality rating 
selected and utilized, as well as identify the source of the data, and its 
publication and/or effective date . The Appraiser is expected to be aware of 
local cost data from builders, contractors, building supply firms, and other 
building industry participants as a check against the published cost data.

Handbook 4000.1  847 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  The Appraiser must also provide a supporting explanation when applying 
adjustments to the published cost data, such as adjustments for:  
• transportation and labor in remote areas;  
• entrepreneurial profit; or  
• fees and charges unique to the area.  
Instructions for the cost approach as applied to Manufactured Home s are 
addressed in the Manufactured Home Appraisal Report section of the FHA 
Single Family Housing Appraisal Report and Data Delivery Guide . 
(2) Income Approach to Value for Residential Properties  
(a) Standard  
The Appraiser should apply the income approach to a Single Family 
residential Property when there is evidence of recently rented and then sold 
data pairs.  
The Appraiser must verify if the subject or the comparable rentals and sales 
are subject to rent control restrictions. If comparable sales do not have rent 
control restrictions similar to those of the subject, an appropriate adjustment 
should be applied.  
(b) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must analyze rental data and provide support for the estimated 
market rents and adjustments applied to the comparable rentals in the 
reconciliation of this approach.  
The Appraiser must derive the Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM) factor from 
market data and support it prior to applying it to the market rent for the 
subject.  
(3) Sales Comparison Approach  
(a) Standard  
The sales comparison approach is required for all appraisals.  
(b) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must present the data, points of comparison, and analysis; 
provide support for the Appraiser’s choice of comparable properties, and the 
adjustments for dissimilarities to the subject; and include sufficient 
description and explanation to support the facts, analyses and the  Appraiser’s 
conclusion.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  If the data from the market area is insufficient to support some of these 
requirements, the Appraiser must provide the best information available and 
include an explanation of the issue, the data available, the conclusions reached 
and the steps taken by th e Appraiser to attempt to meet the guidelines.  
(c) Comparable Sale Selection  
(i) Characteristics of the Property  
Comparable sale selection must be based on properties having the same or 
similar locational characteristics, physical characteristics and the priority 
the market assigns to each factor, including:  
• site; 
• site view;  
• location;  
• design;  
• appeal;  
• style;  
• age; 
• size; 
• utility;  
• quality;  
• condition; and  
• any other factor that in the Appraiser’s professional judgment is 
recognized as relevant in the subject market.  
(ii) Characteristics of the Transaction  
Definition  
An Arm’s Length Transaction  refers to a transaction between unrelated 
parties and meets the requirements of Market Value . 
Standard  
The Appraiser must utilize Arm’s Length Transactions  for comparable 
properties except when there is evidence that REO sales or short sale /Pre-
Foreclosure Sale  (PFS) transactions are so prevalent that normal Arm’s 
Length Transactions  are not present or supported by the market trend.  
A transaction involving a foreclosure  transfer to a Mortgagee  is not 
evidence of the Market Value , and is not a valid type of comparable sale 
for an FHA -insured Mortgage.

necessary to support the Appraiser’s analysis and conclusion. At a 
minimum, the Appraiser must include the most recent and relevant sales, 
preferably within the last six months. The Appraiser must include at least 
three sales that settled no longer than 12 months prior to the effective date 
of the appraisal . The Appraiser must provide additional support by 
including more sales, offerings, offerings now under contract, or relevant 
sales that set tled more than 12 months prior to the effective date of the 
appraisal.  
The Appraiser must analyze the whole market, including when there are a 
number of sales that may or may not be classified as arm’s length sales or 
may not be classified as directly similar to the Property.  
(d) Adjusting Comparable Properties  
(i) Standard  
Calculation of the Contributory Value includes methods based on the:  
• direct sales comparison approach;  
• cost approach; and

Handbook 4000.1  850 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (e) Comparable Selection in Diverse Real Estate Markets  
(i) Standard  
Comparable sales should be selected based on similar locational and 
physical characteristics, not sales price.  
Subdivisions, Condominiums or Planned Unit Development  Projects  
Arm’s length resale activity from within the established subdivision, 
condominium or PUD  project is often the best indicator of value.  
(ii) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must include an analysis of the comparable properties that 
includes an explanation. The analysis must reflect typical Borrower 
expectations and behavior.  
Subdivisions, Condominiums or Planned Unit Development  Projects  
If the Appraiser uses sales of comparable properties that are located 
outside of the subject’s subdivision or project, the analysis must reflect 
typical Borrower expectations and behavior.  
For Properties in new subdivisions, or units in new (or recently converted) 
Condominium Projects, the Appraiser must include, for comparison, 
properties in the subject market area as well as properties within the 
subject subdivision or project. Whenever po ssible, the Appraiser must 
select at least one sale from a competing subdivision or project and one 
sale from within the subject subdivision or project so that this market 
acceptance may be directly compared. If the new project is mature enough 
to have exp erienced arm’s length resales, the Appraiser must also analyze 
and report those properties.  
(f) Comparable Sale Selection in Rural and Slow Growth Markets  
If insufficient comparable sales have occurred within the previous six months, 
the Appraiser must include at least three sales that occurred less than 12 
months prior to the date of appraisal.  
Where there is a scarcity of recent comparable sales data, the Appraiser may 
include sales older than 12 months as additional sales in markets. The 
Appraiser must report the most recent and relevant sales, and include a 
thorough explanation of the market c onditions, the levels of supply and 
demand, and a reason for the lack of recent sales data.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (g) Sales Concession s 
(i) Definition  
Sales Concession s refer to non -realty items, upgraded features in newly 
constructed houses, or special financing incentives.  
(ii) Standard  
Adjustments are not calculated on a dollar for dollar cost of the financing 
or Sales Concession . However, the dollar amount of any adjustment 
should approximate the market’s reaction to the Sales Concessions based 
on the Appraiser’s analysis of observable and supportable market trends 
and expectations. The adjustment should reflect the difference be tween the 
sales price with the Sales Concessions, and what the Property would have 
sold for without the concessions under typical market conditions.  
(iii) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must verify all comparable sales transactions for Sales 
Concession s and report those findings in the appraisal. The Appraiser 
must clearly state how and to what extent the sale was verified. If the sale 
cannot be verified with someone who has first -hand knowledge of the 
transaction (buyers, sellers, real estate agents in volved in the transaction, 
or one of their representatives), the Appraiser must report the lack of 
verification.  
The Appraiser must make market -based adjustments to the comparable 
sales for any sales or financing concessions that may have affected the 
sales price. The Sales Concession s of the comparable properties are 
adjusted to typical market expectations, not to the specific terms or 
conditions of the sale of the subject. The Appraiser must include an 
explanation of the effect of the Sales Concessions on the sale price of the 
compar able.  
(h) Bracketing  
(i) Definition  
Bracketing  refers to selecting comparable properties with features that are 
superior to and inferior to the subject features.  
(ii) Standard  
Comparable properties must be selected based on the principle of 
substitution, and the analysis will reveal the relevance of that data.

bracket a desired or estimated value.  
(iii) Required Analysis and Reporting  
In analyzing the comparable pool to determine the best comparable sales 
to display and compare in the SCA G rid, the Appraiser must use 
Bracketing  techniques when possible and appropriate.  
(i) Market Condition (Time) Adjustments  
(i) Definition  
Market  Condition Adjustment s refer to adjustments made to reflect value 
changes in the market between the date of the contract for the comparable 
sale and the effective date of the appraisal.  
(ii) Standard  
Within the SCA Grid , the selected  comparable properties may be adjusted 
if they were contracted for sale during a market period different from that 
of the date of valuation. If a market -to-market (time) adjustment is 
warranted, it must be applied to the date of contract rather than the da te of 
closing or deed recordation , when the date of the contract is known . 
(iii) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must provide a summary comment and support for all 
conclusions relating to the trend of the current market  and the adjustment . 
(F) FHA Appraisal Requirements for Market Conditions and  Changing Markets  
(1) Definitions  
Increasing Market refers to any neighborhood, market area, or region that 
demonstrates an increase in prices or improvement in other market conditions as 
evidenced by a decrease of existing inventory and reduced marketing times.  
Declining Market  refers to any neighborhood, market area , or region that 
demonstrates a decline in prices or deterioration in other market conditions as 
evidenced by an oversupply of existing inventory and extended marketing times.  
(2) Standard

applied if there is sufficient proof of the trend from a credible source based on 
a thorough analysis of specific market trends and as evidenced by a sale and 
resale comparison.  
(b) Declining Market s 
In a Declining Market , negative Market Condition Adjustment s should be 
applied if there is sufficient proof of the trend from a credible source based on 
a thorough analysis of specific market trends and as evidenced by a sale and 
resale comparison.  
(3) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must analyze the broad market area first (neighborhood analysis), 
then analyze the specific market (direct sales comparison), and then report how 
the subject relates to its market area.  
The Appraiser must provide support for conclusions regarding housing trends and 
overall market conditions as reported in the “Neighborhood” section of the 
appraisal report form.  
The Appraiser must accurately report market conditions and determine when 
housing trends are increasing, stable , or declining. The Appraiser must provide a 
summary comment as to the continuance of the current trend or if the trend 
appears to be changing, and provide support for all conclusions.  If the Appraiser 
bases the adjustment on a published source, the Appraiser must include a copy of 
which must be included in the addendum.  
In changing markets with Increasing Market or Declining Market  trends, t he 
Appraiser must include an absorption rate analysis, at least two comparable sales 
that closed within 90 Days  prior to the effective date of the appraisal , and a 
minimum of two active listings or pending sales on the SCA Grid (in addition to 
at least three settled sales) . If the Appraiser cannot comply with these 
requirements  due to the lack of market data, a detailed explanation is required  to 
support the market trend conclusion and include all data and analysis used to 
identify the current and  forecasted market.

• ensure they are market tested and have reasonable market exposure to 
avoid the use of overpriced properties as comparable properties;  
• use the actual contract purchase price, or, when not available, adjust 
comparable properties to reflect listing to sale price ratios;  
• include the original list price, any revised list prices, and calculate the total 
Days on Market (DOM). The Appraiser must provide an explanation for 
the DOM that does not approximate periods reported in the 
“Neighborhood” section of the appraisal reportin g form;  
• reconcile the Adjusted Values of active listings or pending sales with the 
Adjusted Values of the settled sales provided; and  
• if the Adjusted Values of the settled comparable properties are higher than 
the Adjusted Values of the active listings or pending sales, determine if a 
Market Condition Adjustment  is appropriate.  
(G) Final Reconciliation  and Conclusion  
(1) Definition  
Final Reconciliation  refers to the process by which an Appraiser evaluates and 
selects from among alternative conclusions to reach a final value estimate, and 
reports the results of the analysis.  
(2) Standard  
After the approaches to value are completed, the Appraiser must check the data, 
calculations and conclusions. The Appraiser must reconcile each approach to 
value, and must reconcile all approaches into a final estimate of value for the 
Property.  
(3) Required Analysis and Reporting  
If the appraisal has no conditions, the Appraiser must render an as -is value 
opinion.  
If the Appraiser must conclude the report under a hypothetical condition or 
extraordinary assumption, the Appraiser must report the issues and requirements 
as one of the following:  
• “subject to completion per plans and specifications on the basis of a 
hypothetical condition that the improvements have been completed;”  
• “subject to the following repairs or alterations (list them) on the basis of a 
hypothetical condition that the repairs or alterations have been 
completed;” or  
• “subject to a required inspection based on the extraordinary assumption 
that the condition or deficiency does not require alteration or repair.”

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  12. Programs and Products  
a. Section 248 Indian Land  Program  (09/14/2015)  
i. Property Rights to be Appraised  
The Appraiser must identify the interest to be appraised based on the type of ownership.  
(A) Fee Simple Unrestricted  
Fee Simple  Unrestricted ownership refers to ownership in Real Property that may be 
bought, sold and transferred between Native American and non-Native American 
purchasers without review by the tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  
(B) Tribal Trust Lands, Restricted Trust Land  
(1) Standard  
The FHA Section 248 program insures Mortgages on houses that are located on 
Indian tribal trust land or Restricted Trust Lands. For these Properties, leased 
ownership of the underlying land remains with the tribe and will be subject to a 
long-term, 50 -year ground lease (or a 25 -year lease with a 25 -year renewable 
term).  
(2) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must determine the value for the Leasehold Estate  using the 
analysis and reporting guidance on Leasehold  in this Handbook 4000.1 . 
ii. Access to Property  
Tribally owned and maintained streets and utilities are considered publicly owned. The 
Appraiser must report Easements and maintenance agreements for nonpublic, common 
ownership interests that affect the access and utility of the Property.  
iii. Approaches to Value  
The Appraiser must be familiar with the applicable ownership and use restrictions and 
develop a credible value for the Property. The supply of comparable sales and rental 
transactions varies by site and by tribe. Until sufficient sales exist on a reservati on or 
within the specific Indian area to provide a reasonable sales comparison approach for 
determining the value of tribal trust Leaseholds  or allotted land sales, the Appraiser must 
rely on other value indicators. The appraisal process must be documented  more 
thoroughly than a typical market appraisal. USPAP  Standards 1 and 2 are effective in 
allowing the Appraiser to “correctly employ those recognized methods and techniques 
that are necessary to produce a credible appraisal.” In addition, “in reporting the results of 
a Real Property appraisal an appraiser mus t communicate each analysis, opinion and

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  conclusion in a manner that is not misleading.” An appraisal on trust land may rely more 
on the cost approach or data developed from other tribes. HUD will accept the report if 
the Appraiser has documented the research, information developed and conclusion s 
clearly for the intended users to understand.  
iv. Cost Approach to Value  
The cost approach is often the primary indication of value based on the unique nature of 
land rights in the reservation. The value of the site as vacant will depend on the property 
rights held by an individual. If the Appraiser’s analysis indicates that th e value of the site 
may be zero or a small Leasehold  value, the Appraiser must enter this information in the 
“Cost Approach” section of the  form and enter the statement “subject is on Tribal Trust 
Land with annual rent not capitalized” in the “Comments” se ction. If a market exists and 
an interest in the land was purchased, the value is estimated via traditional cost approach 
methods  described in t his Handbook 4000.1 . 
(A) Cost Approach for New Construction  
The following are instructions specific to New Construction  on tribal lands.  
In addition to including the cost of water, septic, and any other onsite costs in the cost 
approach, for lands within the reservation the Appraiser may provide an allowance 
for off -site development costs. The lesser of actual pro -rated costs or up to 15 percent 
of the cost of the construction of the subject house may be added for off -site 
infras tructure associated with development of the subject lot. This policy applies 
principally to New Construction  where such charges are assessed by tribally approved 
entities, such as housing entities or housing authorities, or agreements with other 
federal or local government bodies for providing power, utilities, sewer, water or road 
construction. The costs to bri ng utilities, including public water, sewer, electricity and 
telephone, to sites represent significant development costs. The traditional tract 
development of residential houses may not be a part of the local culture. Therefore, 
the utility costs to hook u p to any form of a public system in a more rural area can 
exceed local standards.  
In remote areas, the construction costs in construction cost manuals may have to be 
adjusted for transportation, labor or other costs not included in the basic estimate. 
Architect fees are not typically reflected in the base building costs. Due to special 
circumstances, the normal allocation for this fee may not automatically reflect the 
above actual cost. The Appraiser must provide a supporting explanation for the 
adjustments to the construction costs.  
(B) Cost Approach for Existing Construction  
Where market sales are limited, FHA requires the cost approach to be completed on 
all tribal trust appraisals, including a credible estimate of depreciation. In addition to 
developing the cost approach  described in this Handbook 4000.1  the Appraiser must 
report the following:

• the source and date, if electronic version. Upload as an exhibit into the report 
when available;  
• the page numbers of cost tables or factors, if paper version. The reviewer or 
reader must be able to replicate;  
• all current multipliers applicable to locale and time as updated and published 
by the cost service used; and  
• depreciation due to normal aging, which may be derived from the tables in the 
cost service book.  
A computer -generated cost analysis is acceptable in place of the above as long as the 
printout contains sufficient information to verify that all significant property features 
have been properly addressed in the cost analysis.  
v. Sales Comparison Approach to Value  
The Appraiser must follow the Sales Comparison Approach  instructions outlined in this 
Handbook 4000.1 . In addition to the typical data sources the Appraiser must obtain sales 
information from the local tribal or BIA realty office if available. The Appraiser may 
consider sales from other reservations within the region if appropriate.  
The order of selection preferences for sales depends upon the type of interest in the land 
being appraised:  
• tribal trust Leasehold  sales (market sales between tribal members);  
• sales of allotted land trust between tribal members;  
• Fee Simple  within the reservation (residual value of the improvements by 
adjusting out the land contribution); or  
• Fee Simple  proximate to the reservation.  
The Appraiser must report the property rights in the “Ownership” line of the SCA G rid 
and apply an appropriate adjustment (if any). In addition, the Appraiser must explain the 
differences in ownership rights of the comparable properties as compared to the subject, 
and the basis for any adjustment.  
vi. Income Approach to Value  
If the Appraiser determines that this approach can be credibly completed, refer to the 
income approach  section in this Handbook 4000.1 . If the Property includes a rental 
unit(s), the Appraiser must provide an estimate of monthly rent for each unit and note if 
the rent is limited to the tribal sub -market.  
vii. Final Reconciliation  of Value  
The Appraiser must follow the final reconciliation of value  instructions outlined in this 
Handbook 4000.1 . Where market information is limited and the support for the sales

the cost approach.  
b. Section 247 Hawaiian Home Land s Program  (09/20/2021 ) 
Due to the nature of the title  and property rights, the Appraiser must develop the cost for both 
Existing and New Construction . When appropriate, the Appraiser must attempt to apply the 
income and sales comparison approaches.  
The Appraiser must include the following language in the Appraiser report: “ The value 
defined for this appraisal is not ‘Market Value ’ as defined in the standard documents of form 
appraisal reports. This appraisal has been completed for FHA mortgage insurance purposes, 
per HUD instructions for Department of Hawaiian Home Land s (DHHL) properties .” 
The Appraiser must develop a cost approach from a published cost service in addition to 
developing the cost approach  described in this Handbook 4000.1 . The Appraiser’s report 
must include:  
• photocopies of all pages used to derive the cost figures, except as noted below;  
• application of all current multipliers necessary and published by the cost service;  
• no marketing expense to the cost analysis of a DHHL property appraisal because 
these Properties are not freely marketable;  
• entrepreneurial venture may only be included if reasonable profit and overhead are 
not already included in all costs;  and 
• depreciation due to normal aging, which may be derived from the tables in the cost 
service book. Depreciation from incurable external or functional obsolescence should 
be based on verifiable market extractions, by paired -sales analysis and capitalized 
rent loss. 
The Appraiser may use a computer -generated cost analysis provided it contains sufficient 
information to verify that all significant property features have been properly addressed in 
the cost analysis. Accordingly, the Appraiser will not be required to supplement a computer -
generated cost analysis with photocopies from the c ost service book.  
c. Standard 203(k) and Limited 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgages  (09/14/2015)  
The Appraiser may be asked to perform two separate types of valuation by the Mortgagee for 
Standard 203(k) and Limited 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgages. The Mortgagee may order 
both reports from the same Appraiser or select two different Appraisers for the two valuation 
assignments.  
If a Mortgagee requires both an as -is and an after -improved value of the Property, the case 
will require two separate appraisal assignments and reports:  
• an analysis to provide the as -is value; and  
• a separate analysis performed under the hypothetical condition that the repairs have 
been completed.

analyze all information necessary for credible assignment results.  
(C) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must apply all appropriate methods and techniques necessary for 
credible assignment results.  
(D) Sales Comparison Based Extraction Method  
If there is sufficient data based on direct sales comparison to produce credible results, 
the Appraiser must calculate the adjustment and explain the methodology and 
analysis supporting the method and results in the appraisal report. The Appraiser must 
apply the extracted adjustment to the comparable sales  and include the reasoning that 
supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions in the report.  
If there is insufficient data to perform a matched pairs analysis the Appraiser must 
analyze and report one of the approaches below to calculate an appropriate 
adjustment.  
(E) Cost Approach Based Method  
The Appraiser must include the details of the item(s) being valued and measure the 
Contributory Value  of the component(s) to the whole by calculating the cost of the 
item less accrued depreciation. The Appraiser must include consideration of physical 
depreciation, functional obsolescence (including superadequacies) and external 
obsolescence in the estimat e of accrued depreciation and apply the resulting 
calculation of the Contributory Value to the comparable sales.  
(F) Income Approach Based Methods  
(1) Gross Rent Multiplier Method  
If the Property is located in a market where the Appraiser can calculate a GRM, 
and rental data for properties with similar special energy components is available, 
the Appraiser must extract an adjustment relevant to the rental value of the feature 
from th e analysis of those similar rentals and apply the appropriate GRM factor to 
calculate an adjustment for the comparable sales.  
(2) Net Income/Savings Capitalization Method  
The Appraiser may use an income approach solution based on capitalization of 
savings attendant to the alternative energy source. The Appraiser may estimate the 
present value of the future benefit using the discounted cash flow technique or 
commercially available tools; however, the Appraiser must be competent to use 
them and provide an exp lanation of the analysis.

iv. Property Assessed Clean Energy  
(A) Definition  
Property Assessed Clean Energy  (PACE) refers to programs that may provide an 
alternative means of financing energy and other PACE -allowed improvements for 
residential Properties using financing provided by private enterprises in conjunction 
with state and local governments. Generally, the repayment of the PACE obligation is 
collected in the same manner as a special assessment tax ; it is collected by the local 
government, rather than paid directly by the Borrower to the party providing the 
PACE financing.  
Generally, the PACE  obligation is also secured in the same manner as a special 
assessment tax against the Property. In the event of a sale, including a foreclosure  
sale, of the Property with outstanding PACE financing, the obligation will continue 
with the Property causing the new homeowner to be responsible for the payments on 
the outstanding PACE amount. In cases of foreclosure, priority collection of 
delinquent payments for the PACE assessment may be waived or relinquished . 
(B) Required Analysis and Reporting  
The Appraiser must review the sales contract  and property tax records for the 
Property to determine the amount of any outstanding PACE  obligation:  
• if the Mortgagee notifies the Appraiser that the subject Property is subject to a 
PACE  obligation ; 
• when the Appraiser observes that the property taxes for the subject Property 
are higher than average for the neighborhood and type of dwelling ; or 
• when the Appraiser observes energy -related building components or 
equipment or is aware of other PACE -allowed improvements  during the 
inspection process.  
The Appraiser must report the outstanding amount of the PACE  obligation for the 
subject Property.

one- to four -unit residential Property acquired by HUD as a result of a foreclosure  on an 
FHA -insured Mortgage or other means of acquisition, whereby the Secretary of HUD 
becomes the property owner and offers it for sale to recover the mortgage insurance claim 
that HUD paid to the Mortgagee.  
ii. Standard  
An appraisal may be ordered on a HUD REO Property  as one of one or more evaluation 
tools to establish list price or subsequent price adjustments.  
(A) Assignment Type  
Under “Assignment Type” in the “Subject” section of the appraisal reporting form,

If the utilities are off at the time of inspection, the Appraiser must ask to have them 
turned on and complete all requirements under Utilities – Mechanical Components . 
However, if it is not feasible to have the utilities turned on, then the appraisal must be

(C) Sales Comparison Approach,  Use of Real Estate Owned Sales as Comparable 
Sales  
When considering sales to be utilized as comparables, the Appraiser must note the 
conditions of the sale and the motivation of the sellers and purchasers.  
In some markets, non -arm’s length sales constitute the majority of recent transactions 
of similar properties and thus are significant in the analysis of the subject. This 
assignment is to estimate Market Value , so REO sales, short sale s and other non -
arm’s length transactions  must not automatically be chosen as comparables. If there is 
compelling evidence in the market to warrant their use, the Appraiser must provide 
additional explanation and support in the “Analysis” section of the sales comparison 
approach.  
Transfers to a Mortgagee or entity that owns the Mortgage by deed of trust, through 
foreclosure  sale or sheriff’s sale, are not acceptable as comparable sales.

REO sales to ensure similarity to the subject, especially in physical condition.

illegal use or an extraordinary condition, the Appraiser must estimate the cost to bring 
the Property into compliance with zoning  or typical marketability. The Appraiser 
must report whether any grandfathered use is allowed. The Appraiser may contact the 
Asset Management (AM) contractor for guidance and clarification when appraising a 
HUD home that is impacted by extraordinary circum stances.

An electronic signature  conducted in accordance with the Electronic 
Signature Performance Standards (Performance Standards) is accepted on 
FHA documents requiring signatures to be included in the case binder  for 
loan insurance, unless otherwise prohibited by law.  
Electronic signature s meeting the Performance Standards are treated as 
equivalent to handwritten signatures.  
(iii) Electronic Signature  Performance Standards  
The Performance Standards are the set of guidelines that govern FHA 
acceptance of an electronic signature . The use of electronic signatures is 
voluntary. However, Lenders choosing to use electronic signatures must 
fully comply with the Performance Standards.  
The Electronic Signature s in Global and National Commerce Act 
(ESIGN Act) Compliance and Technology

requirements of the E SIGN Act, including those relating to disclosures, 
consent, signature, presentation, delivery, retention and any state law 
applicable to the transaction.  
Third Party Documents  
Third Party Documents refer to those documents that are originated and 
signed outside of the control of the Lender, such as the sales contract . 
FHA will accept electronic signature s on Third Party Documents included 
in the case binder  for loan insurance endorsement in accordance with the 
ESIGN Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). An 
indication of the electronic signature and date should be clearly visible

The Lender must be able to prove that the signer certified that the 
document is true, accurate, and correct at the time signed. Electronic 
signature s are only valid under the ESIGN Act if they are “executed or 
adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.” Establishing intent 
includes:  
• identifying the purpose for the Borrower signing the electronic 
record;  
• being reasonably certain that the Borrower knows which electronic 
record is being signed; and  
• providing notice to the Borrower that their electronic signature  is 
about to be applied to, or associated with, the electronic record.

debt. Lenders may obtain information on delinquent Federal Debt s from 
public records, credit reports or equivalent, and must check all Borrowers 
against the Credit Alert Verification Reporting System  (CAIVRS) . 
(b) Verification  
If a delinquent Federal Debt  is reflected in a public record, credit report or 
equivalent, or CAIVRS  or an Equivalent System, the Lender must verify the 
validity and delinquency status of the debt by contacting the creditor agency 
to whom the debt is owed. If the debt was identified through CAIVRS, the 
Lender must contact the creditor agency using the co ntact phone number and 
debt reference number reflected in the Borrower’s CAIVRS report.  
If the creditor agency confirms that the debt is valid and in delinquent status 
as defined by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 , then the 
Borrower is ineligible for an FHA -insured Loan until the Borrower resolves 
the debt with the creditor agency.  
The Lender may not deny a Loan solely on the basis of CAIVRS  information 
that has not been verified by the Lender. If resolved either by determining that 
the information in CAIVRS is no longer valid or by resolving the delinquent 
status as stated above, the Lender may continue to process the loan 
application.  
(c) Resolution  
In order for a Borrower with verified delinquent Federal Debt  to become 
eligible, the Borrower must resolve their federal non -tax debt in accordance 
with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 .

evaluating the creditworthiness of the Borrower in order to limit the risk of Default.  
Title  I Loans are not eligible for automated underwriting through the Technology Open To

Handbook 4000.1  921 
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  Before making a determination on the creditworthiness of an applicant, a Lender must 
conduct an interview to resolve any material discrepancies between the information 
on the loan application and information on the credit report to determine accurate and 
complete information.  
The Lender is not required to obtain a credit report for non -credit qualifying 
Streamline Refinance  transactions . 
(B) Types of Credit History  
(1) Traditional Credit  
Lenders must pull a credit report that draws information from at least one national 
credit bureau. If the Lender obtains credit information from more than one 
repository, the reports should be merged. Lenders are prohibited from developing 
non-traditional credit history to use in place of a traditional credit report.  
If the credit report generates a credit score, the Lender must utilize traditional 
credit history.  
(a) Requirements for the Credit Report  
Credit reports must obtain all information from at least one credit repository 
pertaining to credit, residence history, and public records information; be in an 
easy to read and understandable format; and not require code translations. The 
credit report ma y not contain whiteouts, erasures, or alterations. The Lender 
must retain copies of all credit reports.  
The credit report must include:

• all credit and legal information not considered obsolete under the 
FCRA, including information for the last seven years regarding:

o required monthly payment amount;  
o unpaid balance; and  
o payment history.  
(b) Updated Credit Report or Supplement to the Credit Report  
The Lender must obtain an updated credit report or supplement if the 
underwriter identifies material inconsistencies between any information in the 
case binder  and the original credit report.  
(2) Non-traditional Credit  
For Borrowers without a credit score, the Lender must develop the Borrower’s 
credit history using the requirements outlined below.  
(a) Independent Verification of Non -traditional Credit Providers  
When the Lender uses non -traditional credit, the Lender must independently 
verify the Borrower’s credit references by documenting the existence of the 
credit provider and that the provider extended credit to the Borrower.  
To verify the existence of each credit provider, the Lender must review public 
records from the state, county, or city or other documents providing a similar 
level of objective information.  
To verify credit information, the Lender must:  
• use a published address or telephone number for the credit provider 
and not rely solely on information provided by the applicant; and  
• obtain the most recent 12 months of canceled checks, or equivalent 
proof of payment, demonstrating the timing of payment to the credit 
provider.  
To verify the Borrower’s rental payment history, the Lender must obtain a 
rental reference from the appropriate rental management company, provided 
the Borrower is not renting from a Family Member , demonstrating the timing 
of payment for the most recent 12 months in lieu of 12 months of canceled 
checks or equivalent proof of payment.  
(b) Sufficiency of Non -traditional Credit References  
To be sufficient to establish the Borrower’s credit, the non -traditional credit 
history must include three credit references, including at least one of the 
following:

• utility company reference (if not included in the rental housing 
payment), including:  
o gas; 
o electricity;  
o water;  
o television service; or  
o internet service.  
If the Lender cannot obtain all three credit references from the list above, the 
Lender may use the following sources of unreported recurring debt:  
• insurance premiums not payroll deducted (e.g., medical, auto, life, 
renter’s insurance);  
• payment to child care providers made to businesses that provide such 
services;  
• school tuition;  
• retail store credit cards (e.g., from department, furniture, or appliance 
stores, or specialty stores);  
• rent-to-own (e.g., furniture, appliances);  
• payment of that part of medical bills not covered by insurance;  
• a documented 12 -month history of savings evidenced by regular 
deposits resulting in an increased balance to the account that:  
o were made at least quarterly;  
o were not payroll deducted; and  
o caused no Insufficient Funds (NSF) checks;  
• an automobile lease;  
• a personal loan from an individual with repayment terms in writing 
and supported by canceled checks to document the payments; or  
• a documented 12 -month history of payment by the Borrower on an 
account for which the Borrower is an authorized user . 
(3) Minimum Decision Credit Score  
(a) Definition  
The Minimum Decision Credit Score  (MDCS) refers to the credit score 
reported on the Borrower’s credit report when all reported scores are the 
same. Where three differing scores are reported, the middle score is the 
MDCS. Where two differing scores are reported, the MDCS is the lowest 
score. Where only one score is reported, that score is the MDCS.  
An MDCS  is determined for each Borrower.

order: (1) previous housing expenses and related expenses, including utilities; (2) 
installment debts; and (3) revolving accounts.

Major derogatory credit excludes medical collections . On revolving accounts, 
major derogatory credit must include any payments made more than 90 Days 
after the due date, or three or more payments more than 60 Days after the due 
date.  
(b) Payment History Requiring Additional Analysis  
If a Borrower’s credit history does not reflect satisfactory credit as stated 
above, the Borrower’s payment history requires additional analysis.  
The Lender must analyze the Borrower’s delinquent accounts to determine 
whether late payments were based on a disregard for financial obligations, an 
inability to manage debt, or extenuating circumstances. The Lender must

• a review of canceled checks that cover the most recent 12 -month period.  
The Lender must verify and document the previous 12 months of housing history. 
For Borrowers who indicate they are living rent -free, the Lender must obtain 
verification from the property owner where they are residing that the Borrower 
has been living rent -free and the amount of time the Borrower has been living 
rent-free. 
A Loan that has been modified must utilize the payment history in accordance 
with the modification agreement for the time period of modification in 
determining late housing payments.

• all other Mortgage Payment s on the Property, including:  
o real estate taxes;  
o hazard insurance;  
o flood insurance, as applicable;

directly impacts the applicant’s ability to meet financial obligations include:  
• bonuses, part -time or Seasonal Employment  that is not reflected in 
Effective Income;  
• employee benefits (company car, clothing allowance); and  
• public benefits (nutritional assistance/food stamps/seasonal

Significant additional income can be cited as a compensating factor subject to 
the following requirements:  
• the Lender must verify and document that the Borrower has received 
this income, and it will likely continue; and  
• the income, if it were included in gross Effective Income, is sufficient 
to reduce the qualifying ratio to not more than 47.  
(c) Potential for Increased Future Earnings  
A Borrower that has potential for increased future earnings may be cited as a 
compensating factor with documented justification, such as job training or 
education in the applicant’s profession.  
(d) Secondary Wage Earner Potential (Employment Relocation)  
Potential income for a secondary wage earner may be cited as a compensating 
factor under the following condition: the secondary wage earner has

(VA) Lenders Handbook  - VA Pamphlet 26 -7, Chapter 4.9 b and e.  
(i) Calculating Residual Income  
Residual income is calculated as total Effective Income of all occupying 
Borrowers less:  
• state income taxes;  
• federal income taxes;  
• municipal or other income taxes;  
• retirement or Social Security;  
• proposed total Loan Payment ; 
• estimated maintenance and utilities;  
• job related expenses (e.g., child care); and  
• the amount of the Gross Up  of any Non taxable Income.  
If available, Lenders must use federal and state tax return s from the most 
recent tax year to document state and local taxes, retirement, Social 
Security and Medicare. If tax returns are not available, Lenders may rely 
upon current pay stubs.  
For estimated maintenance and utilities, Lenders must multiply the Gross 
Living Area  (GLA) of the Property by the maintenance and utility factor 
found in the Lenders Handbook  - VA Pamphlet 26 -7. 
(ii) Using Residual Income  as a Compensating Factor  
To use residual income as a compensating factor, the Lender must count 
all members of the household of the occupying Borrower without regard 
to the nature of their relationship and without regard to whether they are 
joining on title  or the Note to determine “family size.”  
Exception  
The Lender may omit any individuals from “family size” who are fully 
supported by a source of verified income that is not included in the 
Effective Income in the loan analysis. These individuals must voluntarily 
provide sufficient documentation to verify their income to qualify for this 
exception.  
From the table provided in Lenders Handbook - VA Pamphlet 26 -7, select 
the applicable loan amount, region and household size. If residual income 
equals or exceeds the corresponding amount on the table, it may be cited 
as a compensating factor.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  The Lender must evaluate all information and documentation regarding the Borrower(s) 
and the proposed Loan in order to confirm that the Loan is eligible for the Title  I program 
and meets its underwriting requirements. Once the Lender determines that the Loan 
complies with Title I program requirements, it may proceed with the insurance 
application process.  
(A) Reporting Loan for Insurance  
Lenders must apply for Title  I loan insurance using FHAC within 31 Days from the 
later of the following dates:

To initiate the insurance process, the Lender must complete the Title  I Insurance 
Application function in FHAC.  
FHAC is used for the following steps in the insurance process:  
• case number assignment;  
• completing the insurance application;  
• reporting transfers prior to insuring;  
• reporting case updates; and  
• checking the case status.  
Instructions for specific requirements for data format and delivery to FHAC are found 
in the FHA Connection Guide . 
The Application for Insurance screen requires the Lender to enter additional data 
about the Lender. The system will either confirm that the data entered was accepted, 
or will provide information regarding corrections the Lender must make to 
successfully co mplete this step. Data fields that must be completed are grouped by the 
following subject areas:  
• general Lender information  
• Lender information  
• credit/underwriting information  
• Borrower information  
• address Information

A Loan Insurance Certificate (LIC) is  not produced in FHAC for Title  I Property 
Improvement Loans.  
(D) Late Reporting  
The Lender may report the Loan for insurance after 30 Days provided that the Loan is 
not in Default.  
Lenders must certify, via FHAC, that all Loans reported for insurance after 30 Days 
from the Disbursement  are not currently in Default. A certification window 
automatically appears when a Loan is reported past the deadline and must be checked 
in order to continue the insurance submission process.  
At the time of the certification the Lender is confirming that:  
• no Loan Payment  was currently past due more than 30 Days; and  
• the Lender or its agents did not provide the funds to bring and/or keep the 
Loan current or to bring about the appearance of an acceptable payment 
history.  
(E) Upfront Insurance Premium Not Required  
The Title  I Property Improvement Loan program does not require a UFIP.  
(F) Annual Premium Charges  
HUD requires that payment be made within 25 Days from the date of each billing 
statement. The billing statement will specify the payment due date.  
Lenders must follow procedures for Annual Insurance Premium and Billing and 
Remittance . 
iv. Inspection Requirements for Loans Pending Closing or Insurance in 
Presidentially -Declared Major Disaster Area s 
All Properties with pending Loan closing or insurance in Presidentially -Declared Major 
Disaster Area s (PDMDA) must have a damage inspection  report that identifies and 
quantifies any dwelling damage. The report must be dated after the Incident Period (as

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  3. Direct and Dealer Loan  Process for Manufactured Home  Loan Program  
Loans insured under FHA’s Manufactured Home  Loan program are categorized by either of two 
origination processes: Direct Loan s or Dealer Loan s. 
A Dealer for a Manufactured Home  Loan refers to a person or business that is engaged in the 
business of manufactured home retail sales. Dealers of manufactured home sales have a financial 
interest (either direct or indirect) in the transaction.  
a. Direct Loan s (09/26/2022 ) 
i. Definition  
A Direct Loan  process refers to where the Borrower applies directly to the Lender or its 
sponsored TPO for the Loan without assistance from a Dealer , contractor,  or third party 
that has a financial interest in the loan transaction.  
ii. Standard  
The credit application, signed by the Borrower, may be filled out by the Borrower or by a 
person acting at the direction of the Borrower who does not have a financial interest in 
the loan transaction.  
For a Direct Loan  purchase transaction, loan proceeds are disbursed to the Borrower and 
seller jointly. However, the Borrower may provide the Lender with an executed 
assignment of Borrower’s interest in the loan proceeds to the seller on or before the date 
of disbursement to properly complete payment.

Relationship with an FHA Title  I approved Lender that will provide financing to the 
home purchaser.  
The Dealer and Title  I Lender  may agree to require partial or full recourse in a provision 
in the loan documents against the Dealer to reduce or eliminate the Lender’s loss in the 
event of foreclosure  or repossession. Recourse provisions are subject to the requirements 
described in Recourse from Dealer .

comply with requirements described in Recourse from Dealer . 
iii. Dealer Approval and Monitoring  
The Lender is responsible for approving Dealers prior to the Dealer’s participation in the 
Dealer Loan  process. The Lender must complete an investigation of the Dealer and 
document the findings for approval before the Dealer may begin originating Title  I Loans 
through the Lender.  
(A) General Criteria  
Each Dealer must demonstrate previous business experience in manufactured home 
retail sales. The Lender must evaluate the Dealer on the basis of experience and 
approve only those Dealers that the Lender considers to be reliable, financially

programs. The Lender must ensure that no TPO or contractor engages such an 
entity or person to perform any function relating to the origination of an FHA -
insured Loan. The Lender must check the System for Award Management (SAM)  
and the Credit Alert Verification Reporting System  (CAIVRS)  and must follow

person or entity; 
• any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the Dealer or related 
entities, in which the Dealer’s officers and stockholders have a personal 
interest (unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder). “Personal 
interest” refers to a relationship between the Dealer and a person or entity

fees, organization costs, etc., except unamortized servicing costs carried at 
a value established by an Arm’s Length Transaction and presented in 
accordance with Generally Accepted Acc ounting Principles (GAAP);  
• that portion of an asset not readily marketable, and for which appraised 
values are very subjective, carried at a value in excess of a substantially 
discounted appraised value; and  
• any asset which is principally used for the personal enjoyment of an 
officer or stockholder and not for normal business purposes.

In addition to the initial and annual dealer approval reviews, a Lender must monitor 
each approved Dealer’s activities with respect to Loans insured by HUD on an 
ongoing basis. The Lender must take prompt action to resolve any dealer deficiencies 
discovere d. A Lender’s monitoring of Dealers must include the following.  
(1) Quality of Borrower Applicants

Development,” “FHA,” or “HUD” to convey the impression that the Dealer has a 
special relationship with the federal government. Other prohibited marketing 
practices include material that states or implies that it is an official government 
notice, Title  I is a grant program, Title I provides Special Benefits for a particular 
area or group, government funding for the program is limited in amount or for a 
limited time period, the Borrowers are pre -approved, poor credit is acceptable, 
HUD approved the Deale r, or the loan funds can be used for debt consolidation. 
Copies of dealer advertisements and other marketing materials issued by the 
Dealer must be maintained in the Dealer’s file with the other required documents.  
Special Benefits  refer to benefits other than volume incentives for Dealers which 
a home manufacturer funds from general corporate revenues by charging them 
against corporate overhead and profit without changing the wholesale (base) price 
of a Manufactured Home  (or series of homes), as reflected in the manufacturer ’s 
published wholesale (base) price list, and which are limited to payments by the 
manufacturer directly to:  
• a financial institution to buy down  or reduce the interest rate, Discount 
Points, or other fees or charges related to a lending agreement for a 
Dealer ’s manufactured home inventory or floor plan  financing needs; or

manufacturer ’s homes, one or more Dealer ’s services, and related 
manufactured home materials and products in such media.  
(4) Monitor Complaints  
The Lender must monitor complaints received on Loans originated by the Dealer. 
Documentation for all complaints and their resolution must be maintained in the 
Dealer’s file. Particular attention should be focused on the quality of service 
offered, whether warranties are honored in a timely manner, and the general 
manner in which the Dealer resolves compla ints and conducts their business.  
(5) Prohibition of Kickbacks and other Irregularities  
All credible allegations of irregularities (kickbacks, false statements, etc.) must be 
promptly reported to either HUD’s QAD  or to HUD’s Office of the Inspector 
General (OIG) . All referrals to the OIG should be made to the OIG Hotline’s call 
center at 1 -800-347-3735 or via the OIG Hotline’s website at 
www.hudoig.gov/hotline . 
(6) Material Changes of Dealer  
A Lender is responsible for monitoring each Dealer, including any material 
change in their trade name, places of business, type of ownership, type of 
business, or principal individuals who control or manage the business.  
Upon discovery of any material change, the Lender must determine that the 
eligibility of the Dealer has not changed.  
(7) Maintain Dealer Files  
The Lender is to maintain a separate file for each approved Dealer. The file is to 
include the initial application and documentation used for approval and any 
information regarding the Lender’s experience with Title  I Loans involving the 
Dealer. Each file must consist of information regarding borrower Default rates, 
records of inspections of homes delivered and installed by the Dealer, copies of 
letters concerning borrower complaints and their resolution, material ch anges, 
copies of dealer advertisements and other marketing materials, and records of the 
Lender ’s visits to the Dealer’s premises.  
(8) Termination of the Dealer  
A Dealer’s approval will be terminated if a Dealer does not satisfactorily perform 
its contractual obligations to Borrowers, does not comply with Title  I program 
requirements, or is unresponsive to inquiries pertaining to lender supervision and 
monitoring requirements. The Lender is required to notify HUD immediately with 
written documentation of the reason(s) for termination. A Dealer whose approval

An Electronic Signature  refers to any electronic sound, symbol, or process 
attached to or logically associated with a contract or record and executed 
or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record. FHA does not 
accept an electronic signature that is solely voice or au dio. Digital 
signatures are a subset of electronic signatures.  
(ii) Use of Electronic Signature s 
An electronic signature  conducted in accordance with the Electronic 
Signature Performance Standards (Performance Standards) is accepted on 
FHA documents requiring signatures to be included in the case binder  for 
loan insurance, unless otherwise prohibited by law.  
Electronic signature s meeting the Performance Standards are treated as 
equivalent to handwritten signatures.  
(iii) Electronic Signature  Performance Standards  
The Performance Standards are the set of guidelines that govern FHA 
acceptance of an electronic signature . The use of electronic signatures is 
voluntary. However, Lenders choosing to use electronic signatures must 
fully comply with the Performance Standards.  
The Electronic Signature s in Global and National Commerce Act 
(ESIGN Act) Compliance and Technology  
A Lender’s electronic signature  technology must comply with all 
requirements of the ESIGN Act, including those relating to disclosures,

• Servicing and Loss Mitigation Documentation: Electronic 
signature s will be accepted on any documents associated with 
servicing or loss mitigation services for FHA -insured Loans.

will be accepted on any documents associated with the filing of a 
claim for FHA insurance benefits, including form HUD -637, Title 
I Claim for Loss . 
Associating an Electronic Signature  with the Authorized Document  
The Lender must ensure that the process for electronically signing 
authorized documents provide for the document to be presented to the 
signatory before an electronic signature  is obtained. The Lender must 
ensure that the electronic signature is attached to, or logically associated 
with, the document that has been electronically signed.  
Intent to Sign  
The Lender must be able to prove that the signer certified that the 
document is true, accurate, and correct at the time signed. Electronic 
signature s are only valid under the ESIGN Act if they are “executed or 
adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.” Establishing intent 
includes:  
• identifying the purpose for the Borrower signing the electronic 
record;  
• being reasonably certain that the Borrower knows which electronic 
record is being signed; and

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  • providing notice to the Borrower that their electronic signature  is 
about to be applied to, or associated with, the electronic record.  
Intent to use an electronic signature  may be established by, but is not 
limited to:  
• an online dialog box or alert advising the Borrower that continuing

Single Use of Signature  
Lenders must require a separate action by the signer, evidencing intent to 
sign, in each location where a signature or initials are to be applied.  
This provision does not apply to documents signed by Lender employees 
or Lender contractors provided the Lender obtains the consent of the 
individual for the use of their electronic signature . The Lender must 
document the Borrower’s consent.

the identity of the signer by authenticating data provided by the signer 
with information maintained by an independent source. Independent 
sources include, but are not limited to:  
• national commercial credit bureaus;  
• commercially available data sources or services;  
• state motor vehicle agencies; or

signed.  
The Lender must use one of the following methods, or combinations of 
methods, to establish attribution:

Identification Number (PIN), password, or other shared secret, that 
the individual uses as part of the signature process;  
• delivery of a credential to the individual by a trusted third party, 
used either to sign electronically or to prevent undetected alteration 
after the electronic signature  using another method;  
• knowledge base authentication using “out of band/wallet” 
information;  
• measurement of some unique biometric attribute of the individual 
and creation of a computer file that represents the measurement, 
together with procedures to protect against disclosure of the 
associated computer file to unauthorized parties; or  
• public key cryptography.  
Credential Loss Management  
Lenders must have a system in place to ensure the security of all issued 
credentials. One or a combination of the following loss management 
controls is acceptable:

and password, such that no two individuals have the same 
combination of identification code and password;  
• ensuring that identification code and password issuances are 
periodically checked, recalled, or revised;  
• following loss management procedures to electronically 
deauthorize lost, stolen, missing, or otherwise compromised 
identification code or password information, and to issue 
temporary or permanent replacements using suitable, rigorous 
controls;

iii. Loan Insurance Premiums  
FHA collects a UFIP and an annual insurance premium charge for eligible Loans 
originated under the FHA Title  I Manufactured Home  Loan program . 
(A) Upfront Insurance Premium  
(1) Upfront Insurance Premium Amount  
FHA’s Manufactured Home  insurance program requires the payment of UFIP, 
which may be financed into the Loan. The UFIP is 2.25 percent of the Base Loan 
Amount.  
The UFIP charge may be financed into the Loan in full or in part, provided that 
the Total Loan Amount does not exceed the Nationwide Loan Limits . If all or part 
of the UFIP exceeds the Nationwide Loan Limits, the Borrower must pay the 
excess in cash.  
Unless otherwise stated in this section (Underwriting the Transaction), restrictions 
to loan amounts and LTVs are based upon the amount prior to the financing of the 
UFIP (Base Loan Amount). The Total Loan Amount may be increased by the 
financed UFIP amoun t. 
(2) Refund and Credit of Upfront Insurance Premium  
FHA will only refund the UFIP if a Loan is not endorsed for insurance. The 
refund will be returned to the Lender who must apply the refund to the principal 
balance of the subject Loan.  
(B) Annual Loan Insurance Premium  
The periodic loan insurance premium is an annual loan insurance premium that is 
payable monthly. The loan insurance premium charge is 1 percent of the remaining 
principal balance, based upon the Loan’s scheduled amortization.

Handbook 4000.1  1032  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  The loan insurance premium must be paid for the full term of the Loan unless the 
Loan is prepaid in full or the Lender files a claim with FHA.  
(C) Lender Responsibilities  
(1) Insuring an Advance of Credit  
Manufactured Home  Loans may be evidenced by advances of credit, such as retail 
sales installment contracts, in which the Borrower(s) agrees to pay the Dealer 
over a period of time. To insure an advance of credit as a Title  I Loan, an FHA -
approved Lender purchases the advance of credit. Because the Dealer is not 
eligible to insure such a Loan, Title I insurance charges cannot be included in the 
retail sales installment contract.  
(2) Passing Insurance Premiums to Borrower  
The UFIP and annual insurance premiums are obligations of the Lender. The 
Lender may pass the premium charges on to the Borrower, provided that such 
charges are fully disclosed.  
To pass the obligation to pay UFIP and annual insurance premiums to the 
Borrower, the Lender must obtain a signed agreement from the Borrower in 
which the Borrower agrees to:  
• an increase in the principal amount of the Loan from what is shown on the 
retail sales installment contract to an amount that includes both the 
principal amount on the retail sales installment contract and the amount of 
the financeable upfront insurance ch arge;  
• pay the Lender for any portion of the upfront insurance charge that cannot 
be financed; and  
• pay the Lender for the monthly insurance charge (1/12th of the annual 
premium) in addition to the monthly Loan Payment  set in the retail sales 
installment contract.  
Lenders are free to adopt any method that does not violate applicable law, but 
FHA suggests that the agreement be effectuated by a rider to the retail installment 
sales contract , if applicable. The rider must be executed by all Borrowers on the 
Loan at the same time that the retail installment sales contract is executed.  
(D) Required Documentation  
(1) Borrower’s Agreement to Pay Loan Insurance Premiums  
The Lender’s file must contain the Borrower’s agreement to pay loan insurance 
premiums. The agreement may be effectuated through the form of a rider to the 
retail installment contract or other method, and must be signed by all Borrowers.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (2) Rider for Insurance Premiums  
Loans originated by Dealers must have the Borrower execute a rider for loan 
insurance premiums, which authorizes the Lender to charge the Borrower for the 
charges.  
(3) Suggested Language for Rider for Insurance Premiums  
FHA does not supply a form for the rider. Lenders may use the suggested 
language as follows on their letterhead. The form must be signed by all Borrowers 
obligated on the Loan.  
RIDER – UPFRONT INSURANCE PREMIUM  
This rider is made this ____ day of ____________, and is incorporated 
into and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the retail installment sales 
contract  of the same date given by the undersigned borrower(s) to (insert name of 
dealer)  to finance the purchase of (insert description of the manufactured home) . 
The loan to whom this retail installment sales contract  (the loan) has been 
assigned will be insured against loss in the event of a borrower default by the 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) of the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). FHA charges the lender an upfront insurance 
premium at the time the loan is insured and annual premiums during the term of 
the loan. The lender is authorized by FHA to collect such premiums from the 
borrower(s), and this rider constitutes the consent of the borrower(s) to reimburse 
the lender for such premiums , as follows:  
CHECK APPLICABLE BOXES  
Upfront Insurance Premium Fully Financed.  
The upfront premium is (insert number)  percent of $ ___________, the amount 
financed shown on the face of the retail sale installment contract, which equals 
$(insert number) . The upfront premium, when added to the amount financed, 
results in a new amount financed that is equal to or less than FHA’s maximum 
loan amount, and therefore the upfront premium is financed in its entirety with 
this lender. The new amount financed is $ (insert original amount financed + 
upfront premium) . This results in an increased m onthly payment. The revised 
monthly payment is $ (insert new amount) . 
Upfront Insurance is Partially Financed.  
The upfront premium is (insert number)  percent of $___________, the amount 
financed shown on the face of the retail sale installment contract, which equals 
$(insert number) . The upfront premium, when added to the amount financed, 
results in a new amount financed that exceeds FHA’s maximum loan amount, and

that it results in a new amount financed equal to the FHA maximum loan amount. 
Borrower(s) will pay the lender the balance of the upfront premium... The new 
amount financed  is $(insert original amount financed + financeable amount of 
upfront premium) . As a result of the increase in the amount financed, the monthly 
payment is $ (insert new amount) . 
Upfront Insurance Cannot be Financed.  
The upfront premium is (insert number)  percent of $___________, the amount 
financed shown on the face of the retail sale installment contract, which equals 
$(insert number) . The upfront premium cannot be financed because the amount 
financed is equal to FHA’s maximum loan amount. Borrower(s) will pay the 
lender the upfront premium.  
Annual Premium Cannot be Financed  
The annual premiums are based upon the declining balance of the original 
amount financed, and thus will change every year. Borrower(s) will pay 1/12 of 
each annual premium each month in addition to the monthly loan payment set 
forth in paragraph (a). The i nitial monthly premium payment is $ (insert number) . 
The lender will advise the borrower(s) of each annual change in the monthly 
premium payment.

Handbook 4000.1  1046  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (a) Independent Verification of Non -traditional Credit Providers  
The Lender may independently verify the Borrower’s credit references by 
documenting the existence of the credit provider and that the provider 
extended credit to the Borrower.  
To verify the existence of each credit provider, the Lender must review public 
records from the state, county, or city or other documents providing a similar 
level of objective information.  
To verify credit information, the Lender must:  
• use a published address or telephone number for the credit provider 
and not rely solely on information provided by the applicant; and  
• obtain the most recent 12 months of canceled checks, or equivalent 
proof of payment, demonstrating the timing of payment to the credit 
provider.  
To verify the Borrower’s rental payment history, the Lender must obtain a 
rental reference from the appropriate rental management company or landlord, 
demonstrating the timing of payment for the most recent 12 months in lieu of 
12 months of canceled checks  or equivalent proof of payment.  
(b) Sufficiency of Non -traditional Credit References  
To be sufficient to establish the Borrower’s credit, the non -traditional credit 
history must include three credit references, including at least one of the 
following:  
• rental housing payments (subject to independent verification if the 
Borrower is a renter);  
• telephone service; or  
• utility company reference (if not included in the rental housing 
payment), including:

o electricity;  
o water;  
o television service; or  
o Internet service.  
If the Lender cannot obtain all three credit references from the list above, the 
Lender may use the following sources of unreported recurring debt:  
• insurance premiums not payroll deducted (e.g., medical, auto, life, 
renter’s insurance);  
• payment to child care providers made to businesses that provide such 
services;  
• school tuition;

(3) Minimum Decision Credit Score  
(a) Definition  
The Minimum Decision Credit Score  (MDCS) refers to the credit score 
reported on the Borrower’s credit report when all reported scores are the 
same. Where three differing scores are reported, the middle score is the 
MDCS. Where two differing scores are reported, the MDCS is the lowest 
score. Where only one score is reported, that score is the MDCS.  
An MDCS  is determined for each Borrower.  
(b) Standard  
The Lender must determine the MDCS . 
An MDCS  has not been established for Title  I Manufactured Home  Loans that 
would replace the credit underwriting requirements for this program.  
The credit score will only affect the amount of downpayment  required.  
(c) Required Documentation/Data Entry  
When credit scores are available, the Lender must report all scores in FHAC 
for each Borrower.

order: (1) previous housing expenses and related expenses, including utilities; (2) 
installment debts; and (3) revolving accounts.  
(a) Satisfactory Credit  
The underwriter may consider a Borrower to have an acceptable payment 
history if the Borrower has made all housing and installment debt payments 
on time for the previous 12 months and has no more than two 30 -Day late 
Loan Payment s or installment payments in the previous 24 months.  
The underwriter may approve the Borrower with an acceptable payment

major derogatory credit must include any payments made more than 90 Days 
after the due date, or three or more payments more than 60 Days after the due 
date.  
(b) Payment History Requiring Additional Analysis  
If a Borrower’s credit history does not reflect satisfactory credit as stated 
above, the Borrower’s payment history requires additional analysis.  
The Lender must analyze the Borrower’s delinquent accounts to determine 
whether late payments were based on a disregard for financial obligations, an 
inability to manage debt, or extenuating circumstances. The Lender must 
document this analysis in the case  binder . Any explanation or documentation 
of delinquent accounts must be consistent with other information in the file.  
The underwriter may only approve a Borrower with a credit history not 
meeting the satisfactory credit history above if the underwriter has 
documented the delinquency was related to extenuating circumstances.

Handbook 4000.1  1123  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  The lien must be a first lien, superior to any other lien on that Property, and evidenced 
by a properly recorded financing statement, a properly recorded security instrument 
executed by the Borrower and any other owner of the Property, or another acceptable

of the Lender’s lien interest in the Manufactured Home . 
The Lender must ensure that the description of the Manufactured Home  as cited in the 
security instrument is accurate and that the security instrument creates a valid and 
enforceable lien on the Manufactured Home in the jurisdiction in which the Property 
is located. The security instrument must be recorded and perfected in the manner 
specified by applicable state law in the state where the Property is located.  
For a Combination Loan , the Lender may take a security interest in the Manufactured 
Home  as Personal Property  and concurrently place a real property lien on the land. 
FHA permits Manufactured Homes to be split from the land and secured separately.  
xvi. Post-Disbursement  Unit Inspection  
(A) Inspection Requirements for Dealer -Originated Sales  
Dealer -originated sales of Manufactured Home s require the Lender, or an agent of the 
Lender who is not a Dealer, to conduct an inspection of the Manufactured Home after 
it has been delivered and installed at the home site. This inspection must be

g. Post-closing and Endorsement ( 05/09/2022 ) 
i. Lender Pre -endorsement Review  
The Lender must evaluate all submitted information and documentation regarding the 
Borrower(s) and the proposed Loan in order to confirm that the Loan is eligible for the 
Title  I program and meets HUD’s underwriting requirements. This determination must 
include resolution of any problems identified during the case number assignment process.  
ii. Procedures for Endorsement  
(A) Standard  
Immediately after closing and the Disbursement  of loan funds, Lenders must submit 
each Loan to HUD for a post -closing, pre -endorsement approval.  
HUD will examine each Loan after closing and prior to endorsement to ensure that 
the necessary documents have been provided and system data fields are completed.  
The post -closing, pre -endorsement review  is required for both DE Lenders and non -
DE Lenders.  
Non-DE Lenders must submit Loans for the post -closing, pre -endorsement review  in 
addition to the required pre -closing review.  
To initiate the insurance endorsement process, the Lender must complete the Title  I 
Loan Insurance Application in FHAC  and compile the case binder , with all of the 
necessary documents.  
The Loan must be current to be eligible for endorsement.  
(B) Submitting the Loan for Endorsement  
Instructions for specific requirements for data format and delivery to FHAC are found 
in the FHA Connection Title  I User Guide . 
The Lender must:  
• complete the Insurance Application screen in FHAC;  
• remit the UFIP to FHA in a lump sum within 10 Days after the date of loan 
settlement or the Disbursement  Date , whichever is later;

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  • submit evidence of assignment of the case for endorsement in the name of the 
originating Lender, if applicable;  
• submit evidence of case number transfer, if applicable, to another Lender prior 
to closing; and  
• submit case binder  to HUD for post -closing endorsement review.  
(C) Complete Insurance Application in FHAC  
Once the Loan is closed, the Lender must access FHAC to complete the Insurance 
Application screen and pay the UFIP.  
The Insurance Application screen requires the Lender to enter additional data about 
the Loan. The system will either confirm that the data entered was accepted, or will 
provide information regarding corrections the Lender must make to successfully 
complete  this step. Data fields that must be completed are grouped by the following 
subject areas:  
• general loan information  
• Lender information  
• credit/underwriting information  
• Borrower information  
• address information  
(D) Upfront Insurance Premium Remittance  
Lenders must remit the upfront insurance premium electronically through Pay.gov . 
Instructions for accessing Pay.gov can be found in the Title  I User Guide, which can 
be accessed from FHAC  under Property Improvement/Manufactured Home . 
HUD requires the UFIP  to be paid within 10 Days of the Loan Disbursement . 
(E) Late UFIP Payments  
HUD views the owner of the Loan legally responsible for the payment of all valid 
premium charges. If the Lender uses a servicing agent to handle this function, HUD 
can establish billing for the agent, but the Lender remains the owner of the lender 
portfolio.  
The Lender is assessed a penalty charge of 4 percent of the amount of any premium 
payment not received by HUD by the due date. Premium payments received from a 
Lender more than 30 Days after the due date are also assessed daily interest at the 
Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate . However, a Lender is not required to pay a 
penalty charge or daily interest if HUD fails to issue a billing statement for annual 
premium charges in a timely manner.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (1) 10-30 Days Late  
A one -time late charge of 4 percent is assessed on a UFIP payment received more 
than 10 Days after the Disbursement  Date . The Lender must pay the late fee 
before FHA will endorse the Loan for insurance.  
(2) More than 30 Days Late  
If the UFIP is paid more than 30 Days after the Disbursement  Date , the Lender 
will be assessed the late fee plus interest. The interest rate is the Treasury Current 
Value of Funds Rate  in effect when the UFIP payment is received. The Lender 
must pay both charges before FHA will endorse the Loan for insurance.  
(F) Printout of Case Number Assignment Screen  
The Lender must include a printed copy of the case number assignment screen 
showing originating Lender if applicable.  
(G) Submitting Loans for Post -closing/Endorsement Review  
Lenders must submit loan documents to the attention of MH Post -closing 
Endorsement Review at the FOC . 
During the post -closing endorsement review, HUD determines if the Loan meets all 
program requirements. HUD will review the documentation to ascertain if there is 
any indication that any certification or required document is false, misleading, or 
constitute s fraud or misrepresentation.  
(H) Timely Endorsement  
The Lender must report each Loan for insurance in FHAC within 30 Days from the 
date of the Loan’s Disbursement  or purchase from a Dealer or another Lender. Any 
Loan refinanced under this part must similarly be reported on the prescribed form 
within 30 Days from the date of refinancing.  
(I) Initial Request for Endorsement  
The insurance application request is considered complete once HUD has received the 
case binder , the UFIP has been paid, and the insurance application in FHAC has been 
completed and has passed all system validations.  
The date a case binder  is received is based on the date the FOC receives the required 
lender documentation. The Lender is responsible for having the case binder delivered 
to the FOC within the allotted time period. Lenders may confirm the date that the 
lender documentation was received by accessing the Case Status screen in FHAC.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (J) Late Request for Endorsement  
A late endorsement certification must be submitted to HUD with the insurance 
package for review and consideration if the Loan is not submitted for endorsement 
within the required 30 Day period after closing.  
(K) Late Endorsement Certification  
Lenders must certify, via FHAC, that all Loans reported for insurance after 30 Days 
from the Disbursement  are not currently in Default. A certification window 
automatically appears when a Loan is reported past the deadline and must be checked 
in order to continue the insurance submission process.  
At the time of the certification the Lender is confirming that:  
• no Loan Payment  was currently past due more than 30 Days; and  
• the Lender or its agents did not provide the funds to bring and/or keep the 
Lender current or to bring about the appearance of an acceptable payment 
history.  
(L) HUD Determination of Endorsement  
HUD will review the Lender’s certification and make a determination to accept or 
reject the request. HUD will endorse the Loan provided the final review indicates that 
the degree of risk to HUD has not increased since the time of closing. A Loan that is 
in Default when submitted for endorsement will not be insured, except in those 
instances where it can be demonstrated that HUD was responsible for a delayed 
request for endorsement.  
(M) Loan Insurance Certificate  
Once determined as acceptable, HUD will endorse the Loan via FHAC and issue a 
Loan Insurance Certificate (LIC). The LIC will be made available to the Lender 
through FHAC. The LIC must be printed and retained by the Lender in the case 
binder . 
A Loan is not insured until HUD issues an LIC for the Loan. The LIC is an electronic 
document generated by HUD via FHAC and is documentary evidence of the 
insurance.  
(N) Assembly of Case Binder  
The Lender must prepare and submit a uniform case binder  to the FOC.

(1) Non-Endorsement Notice/Notice of Return  
If HUD determines the Loan to be ineligible for endorsement, the FOC will 
generate a Non -Endorsement Notice/Notice of Return  (NOR). The NOR will 
include the reason(s) for non -endorsement and detail any corrective action that 
must be taken by the Lender.  
Corrective action may include providing the FOC with additional or revised 
documentation for the case binder  or providing additional or revised data on the 
Insurance Application screen. After taking corrective action, the Lender can 
access the Insurance Application screen and resubmit the insurance request for 
review. If HUD issues an NOR  and the Lender chooses not to resubmit the case 
for review, the Lender must report this to HUD via FHAC. The Lender must also 
obtain a refund of the UFIP paid to HUD and apply the refund to the principal 
balance of the Lender.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (2) Final Rejection of Endorsement  
If HUD determines that the case is ineligible for endorsement based on a defect 
that cannot be corrected, the NOR  will indicate that it is a permanent rejection. In 
such case, the NOR will instruct the Lender to notify the Borrower that the Loan 
will not be insured by HUD/FHA and to inform the Borrower regarding the 
circumstances that make the Loan ineligible for FHA  insurance. The Lender must 
also obtain a refund of the UFIP paid to HUD and apply the refund to the 
principal balance of the Loan.  
(3) Denied or Canceled Loans  
Lenders must report to HUD, through FHAC, the denial or cancellation of all 
Loans for which a Title  I case number has been issued.  
iii. Post-Endorsement Technical Reviews  
HUD will perform Post-Endorsement Technical Reviews  (PETR)  on a sample of insured 
Loans from the Lender. This review includes a detailed analysis of the origination, credit 
underwriting and post -closing documentation provided by the Lender with the request for 
endorsement submission. HUD may request servicing doc uments or other additional 
documentation from the Lender to complete this review.  
HUD will provide the Lender with a rating for each Loan reviewed and, if applicable, 
specific feedback pertaining to the rating. The ratings are described below.  
(A) Conforming  
A Loan receives a rating of conforming when the lender review finds no 
documentation errors, omissions or violations of Title  I regulations. This rating is also 
dependent on HUD’s determination that the Lender’s decision to approve the Loan 
was sound and the level of risk was acceptable.  
(B) Deficient  
A Loan receives a rating of deficient when the lender review identifies documentation 
errors or omissions that HUD expects can be corrected by the Lender in future 
submissions for insurance endorsement. This rating is also dependent on HUD’s 
determination that the Lender’s decision to approve the Loan was sound and the level 
of risk was acceptable.  
Lenders who consistently submit deficient files may be subject to increased PETR  
sampling and may risk the loss of their Title  I Direct Endorsement privileges.

Handbook 4000.1  1131  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (C) Unacceptable  
A Loan receives a rating of unacceptable when serious violations of FHA 
requirements were found or if documentation was missing that would be necessary to 
determine if underwriting guidelines were followed. HUD will issue a letter to the 
Lender identifying  the reason for the unacceptable rating. The Lender is required to 
respond within 30 Days from the date of the letter, with a satisfactory explanation as 
to why the Loan was approved. Failure to respond, or the receipt of an unsatisfactory 
response, may re sult in HUD requesting the Lender to indemnify HUD against any 
loss associated with the Loan. Demands for indemnification may be made by the 
Director of the Quality Assurance Division  (QAD) , by the Office of Lender Activities 
and Program Compliance or by the Mortgagee Review Board  (MRB).  
If indemnified, the Loan will be flagged within the Title  I insurance system to prevent 
claim payment to the offending Lender. Serious Findings may also result in the loss 
of Title I Direct Endorsement privileges.  
(D) Mitigated  
Loans that were initially rated as unacceptable may subsequently be given a rating of 
mitigated. To receive a mitigated rating, the Lender must provide documentation in

Mortgagee data on Defaulted  Mortgages until a Default  is resolved through 
reinstatement or termination.  
(B) Standard  
The Mortgagee must report the Delinquency /Default Status Codes  that accurately 
reflect the severity of Default and Mortgagee action taken in SFDMS.  
(1) Types of Mortgages to Report

The Mortgagee must report the status of three classes of Mortgages each month:  
• New Delinquencies: The Mortgagee must report Defaulted accounts when 
one full installment is due and unpaid (30 Days Delinquent  - Status Code 
42) and must continue reporting the applicable Status Code until the 
Default is resolved.  
• Open Delinquencies: The Mortgagee must continue to report a Status 
Code 42 until a servicing action has been initiated/approved and/or 
completed, which would warrant a Status Code change.  
• Delinquencies Resolved During the Cycle Month: The Mortgagee must 
report the appropriate Status Code to reflect that the delinquency has been 
addressed.  
(2) Property Vacancy Reporting  
The Mortgagee must advise HUD when the mortgaged Property becomes vacant

day of the following month.  
(a) Reporting Accuracy  
A Mortgagee must submit an accurate SFDMS report. All the information is 
important; some is so critical that if data is inaccurate or missing, the report on 
that Mortgage or even the entire monthly report is automatically rejected by 
SFDMS.  
(b) Quality Control  
A Mortgagee’s Quality Control Plan must ensure that:  
• the reporting staff is properly trained;  
• servicing and foreclosure  staff are aware of reporting requirements and 
of cases reported; and

whether it is prepared manually or by an automated system.  
(C) SFDMS Codes  
(1) Delinquency /Default Status Codes  
The Mortgagee must report the correct Delinquency /Default Status (DDS) Code  
reflecting the status of the Mortgage.  
The Mortgagee must include applicable status dates when reporting DDS Codes. 
SFDMS permits the submission of delinquency data throughout the month.  
(2) Delinquency /Default Reason Codes  
The Mortgagee must report the reason for the Delinquency /Default using the 
Delinquency/Default Reason (DDR) Codes . Changes for the reason for Default 
may occur during the Default episode, and must be reported accordingly.  
(D) Error Reports and Correction  (03/01/2022 ) 
The Mortgagee may receive Error Reports from two systems:  
• EDI, which provides the All Transaction Sets 824 (TS  824) Report (see the 
Electronic Data Interchange Implementation Guide  for additional 
information); or  
• SFDMS . 
The Mortgagee is responsible for retrieving Error Reports from these systems and 
submitting necessary corrections by the fifth business day. HUD will not provide 
additional time to enter corrections.

Mortgagee may adjust the monthly payment based on an evaluation of the 
Borrower’s new financial information;

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (D) FHA -HAMP  Loan Modification  Provisions  
(1) Standard  
The Mortgagee must ensure that the FHA -HAMP  Loan Modification  fully 
reinstates the Mortgage and complies with the interest rate and modified principal 
balance provisions below. Mortgagees must perform a retroactive escrow analysis 
to ensure that the delinquent payments to be capitalized reflect the actual escrow 
funds required for those months and adequate funds to pay escrow bills when due 
to avoid a future escrow shortage without creating a surplus.  
(2) Interest Rate  
The Mortgagee must ensure that any modified loan, including ARM , GPM or 
GEM is a fixed rate  Mortgage.  
At the Mortgagee’s discretion, the Mortgagee may reduce Note interest rates 
below Market Rate; however, discount fees associated with rate reductions are not 
reimbursable. When increasing Note interest rates, the Mortgagee must calculate 
the maximum intere st allowable as the Market Rate.  
(a) Market Rate  
Market Rate is a rate that is no more than 25 bps greater than the most recent 
Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) Rate for 30 -
year fixed rate  conforming Mortgages (U.S. average), rounded to the nearest 
one-eighth of 1 percent (0.125 percent), as of the date a TPP is offered to a 
Borrower  or, when a TPP is not required, the date the Borrower is offered a 
permanent Loan Modification . The Mortgagee must first round the PMMS 
Rate to the nearest one -eighth of 1 percent (0.125 percent) before calculating 
the rate at 25 bps greater than the PMMS Rate . 
(b) Market Rate Resources  
The Weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey results are published on the 
Freddie Mac website . 
(3) Modified Loan Term  
The Mortgagee must re -amortize the total unpaid amount due over 360 months 
from the due date of the first installment required under the modified FHA -
insured Mortgage. The term may be less than 360 months if :  
• requested by the Borrower ; and  
• a term that is less than 360 does not result in the modified PITI being 
greater than the target monthly payment.

will continue to be based on the scheduled unpaid principal balance of the original 
Mortgage, without taking into consideration delinquencies or prepayments . 
(F) Partial Claim Provisions  
The Mortgagee must ensure that a Standalone Partial Claim or Combination Loan  
Modification and Partial Claim fully reinstates the Mortgage. Mortgagees must 
perform a n escrow analysis to ensure that the delinquent payments to be included in

first legal action initiating foreclosure . The automatic 90 -Day extension begins 
the Day after the PFS ATP  is terminated or expires.  
If the Mortgagee has not yet received the Net Sale Proceed s from the Closing 
Agent  and the automatic 90 -Day extension is nearing expiration, the Mortgagee 
must submit a request for extension to the NSC via EVARS no later than 10 Days 
before the 90 -Day extension expires.

(Q) PFS Incentive  
The Mortgagee may claim an incentive  for each completed PFS transaction that 
complies with all HUD PFS requirements.  
(R) Mortgage Insurance Termination

the reported reason for default.  
For any buildings in a PDMDA  that are substantially damaged, Mortgagees must 
follow the PDMDA guidance in Monitoring of Repairs to Substantially Damaged  
Homes . This requirement applies to all Properties covered by a non -COVID -19 
PDMDA  during the COVID -19 pandemic, including those already under a COVID -
19 Loss Mitigation Option , such as COVID -19 Forbearance.  
(B) PDMDA  Loss Mitigation Owner -Occupant Requirement

Handbook 4000.1  1266  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (2) Terms of the Disaster Loan Modification   
The Mortgagee must modify the Mortgage as follows:  
• The total P&I amount of a Borrower’s monthly Mortgage Payment  must 
not increase.  
• The Mortgagee must capitalize into a modified mortgage balance:  
o the accumulated arrearages for unpaid accrued interest; and

chargeable to the Mortgage.  
• The Mortgagee waives the Borrower’s accumulated late fees.  
• The Mortgagee sets the interest rate at no greater than the Market Rate  as 
defined by HUD.  
• The term for the modified loan is 360 months. The term may be less than 
360 months if (i) requested by the Borrower and (ii) a term that is less than 
360 does not result in the modified P&I being greater than current P&I.  
• A Borrower can only receive one Permanent Loss Mitigation Home 
Retention Option  for a PDMDA  per disaster.  
To allow adequate time to complete the Disaster Loan Modification , obtain all 
required signatures and provide adequate notice to the Borrower of the new 
payment, Mortgagees may include an additional month in the total outstanding 
debt to be resolved. The Mortgagee must not provide the Borrower with any cash 
from the Dis aster Loan Modification.  
(E) Disaster Standalone Partial Claim  
The Mortgagee must evaluate Borrowers for a Disaster Standalone Partial Claim at

• The Mortgage was current or less than 30 Days past due as of the date of the 
applicable disaster declaration.  
• The Mortgagee confirms Borrower income is equal to or greater than it was 
prior to the Disaster using a recent pay stub for income, IRS Form  W-2, bank 
statement , or other documentation reflecting the amount of income.

Handbook 4000.1  1267  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  • Borrower(s) can only receive one Permanent Loss Mitigation Home Retention 
Option  for a PDMDA . 
The statutory maximum value of all combined Partial Claims is 30 percent of the 
Unpaid Principal Balance of each FHA -insured Mortgage and any costs that are 
approved by the Secretary.  
For purposes of calculating the maximum available Partial Claim value for each loss 
mitigation action, it is the lesser of:  
• the Unpaid Principal Balance as of the date of Default  at the time of payment 
of the initial Partial Claim, if applicable, multiplied by 30 percent, less any 
previous Partial Claim(s) paid on the FHA -insured Mortgage; or  
• if there are no previous Partial Claim(s), the Unpaid Principal Balance as of 
the date of the current Default multiplied by 30 percent.  
The Disaster Standalone Partial Claim amount may only include  amounts  needed to 
bring the Borrower current  including : 
• arrearages;  
• Mortgagee advances for escrow items;  
• projected escrow shortage amount; and  
• related legal fees and foreclosure  and bankruptcy  costs not higher than the 
foreclosure -related fees and costs HUD has identified as customary and 
reasonable.  
To allow adequate time to complete the Disaster Standalone  Partial Claim, obtain all 
required signatures , and provide adequate notice to the Borrower of the new payment, 
Mortgagees may include an additional month in the total outstanding debt to be 
resolved. The Mortgagee must not provide the Borrower with any cash from the 
Disaster Standalone Partial Claim.  
(F) Required Financial Evaluation for other Loss Mitigation Home Retention 
Options  
Following evaluation for and completion of approved forbearances, the Mortgagee 
must evaluate those Borrowers who do not qualify for either the Disaster Loan 
Modification  or Disaster Standalone Partial Claim Options for other Loss Mitigation 
Home Retention Options . 
Borrowers who do not currently have an increase in living expenses but are 
Delinquent  due to a forbearance received following a disaster declaration are deemed 
to satisfy the eligibility conditions for FHA Loss Mitigation Home Retention Options . 
(G) Terms of the Mortgage are Unaffected  
Nothing in this section confers any right to a Borrower to any loss mitigation or any 
other action by HUD or the Mortgagee. Further, nothing in this section interferes with

initiate foreclosure and reasonable diligence in prosecuting foreclosure following 
expiration of a foreclosure moratorium will apply.  
(H) Home Disposition Option s 
Pre-Foreclosure Sale  or Deed -in-Lieu of Foreclosure  is also available to Borrowers

or FHA -HAMP  are deemed to satisfy the borrower eligibility conditions for 
FHA Loss Mitigation Disposition Options.  
• The Mortgage was current or less than 30 Days past due as of the date of the 
applicable disaster declaration.  
• The Mortgagee obtains from the Borrower a recent pay stub for income, IRS

For a Partial Claim as part of a COVID -19 Recovery Modification, the 
COVID -19 Recovery  Partial Claim must not exce ed 30 percent of the 
unpaid principal balance as of the date of Default at the time of payment 
of the initial Partial Claim less any previous Partial Claims paid.  
• The Mortgagee must first calculate 30 percent of the unpaid 
principal balance as of the date of Default at the time of payment 
of the initial Partial Claim.  
• The Mortgagee must then subtract any previous Partial Claims 
paid to determine the available COVID -19 Recovery  Partial Claim 
amount that can be used for the COVID -19 Recovery 
Modification.  
Step 2 – Arrearages  
The Mortgagee must calculate the arrearages. Arrearages refer to any 
amounts needed to bring the Borrower current and includes:

• Mortgagee advances for escrow items;  
• projected escrow shortage amount; and  
• related legal fees and foreclosure  and bankruptcy  costs not higher 
than the foreclosure -related fees and costs HUD has identified as 
customary and reasonable.  
The Mortgagee must ensure that all Late Charge s and penalties are 
waived. Mortgagees are not required to waive Late Charges and penalties, 
if any, accumulated prior to March  1, 2020.  
Step 3 – Modify the Rate and T erm of the 30-Year  Mortgage  
The modified Mortgage is a 360 -month Loan Modification , which must 
include a COVID -19 Recovery  Partial Claim, if Partial Claim funds are 
available.  
The Mortgagee must first apply available Partial Claim funds toward the 
arrearages. If the COVID -19 Recovery  Partial Claim funds are insufficient 
to cure the arrearages, then the Mortgagee must capitalize the remaining 
arrearages into the modified Mortgage.  
The Mortgagee must then extend the term to 360 months and calculate the 
modified Mortgage Payment . The interest rate of the modified Mortgage is 
no greater than the most recent PMMS Rate for 30 -year fixed rate 
conforming Mortgages (U.S. average), rounded to the nearest one -eighth 
of 1 percent (0.125 percent) as of the date the Borrower is offered a 
COVID-19 Recovery Modification.  
Step 4 – Principal Deferment  for 30 -Year Modification  
If the target payment is not achieved  in Step 3 , the Mortgagee must apply 
available  COVID -19 Recovery  Partial Claim funds as a principal 
deferment  up to the amount needed  to achieve the target payment with the 
modified 30-year Mortgage.  
If the target payment is achieved, the Mortgagee must provide that option 
to the Borrower without proceeding to Step 5.  
Step 5 – Modify the Rate and Term  of the 40 -Year Mortgage  
If the Mortgagee cannot achieve the target payment at Step 4, the 
Mortgagee must modify the Mortgage to a 40 -year (480 -month) Loan 
Modification , which must include a COVID -19 Recovery Partial Claim if 
Partial Claim funds are available .

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  The Mortgagee must first apply available Partial Claim funds toward the 
arrearages. If the Partial Claim funds are insufficient to cure the 
arrearages, the Mortgagee must capitalize the remaining arrearages into 
the modified Mortgage.  
The Mortgagee must extend the term to 480 months to achieve the target 
payment and calculate the modified Mortgage Payment . 
The Mortgagee may extend the term to less than 480 months if:  
• requested by the Borrower; and  
• the modified Mortgage at the lesser term achieves the target 
payment.  
The interest rate of the modified Mortgage must be no more than 50 bps 
greater than the most recent PMMS Rate for 30 -year fixed rate 
conforming Mortgages (U.S. average), rounded to the nearest one -eighth 
of 1 percent (0.125 percent) as of the date the Borrower is offered a 
COVID -19 Recovery Modification. The Mortgagee must round the 
modification interest rate to the nearest one -eighth of 1 percent (0.125 
percent) before adding no more than 50 bps to  the interest rate.  
Step 6 – Principal Deferment for 40 -Year Modification  
If the target payment is not achieved in Step 5, the Mortgagee must apply 
available Partial Claim funds as a principal deferment to achieve the target 
payment with the modified 40 -year Mortgage.  
Step 7 – Target Payment Not Achieved  
If the Mortgagee cannot achieve the target payment using the above steps, 
then the Mortgagee must offer the Borrower  the lowest monthly P&I 
payment achieved under :  
• the COVID -19 Recovery Modification , even if the P&I monthly 
payment increases ; or  
• the COVID -19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim  if the Borrower 
has sufficient Partial Claim funds available .  
If the Borrower affirms that they can make the offered payment, the 
Mortgagee must complete that option.  
(d) Terms  
The Mortgagee must ensure that:  
• the modified Mortgage is a fixed rate Mortgage;  
• the interest rate of the modified Mortgage does not exceed the 
applicable limit set forth in Steps 3 or 5 ;

limitation, HUD’s estimate of holding costs and resale costs that would be incurred if 
title to the mortgaged Property were conveyed to HUD.  
(B) Standard  
Mortgagees must use the CAFMV  for all foreclosure  sales and post-foreclosure sales 
efforts associated with defaulted FHA -insured Mortgages when eligible for CWCOT . 
A Mortgage is eligible for CWCOT when all the following criteria are met:  
• the FHA -insured mortgage insurance is still active for the FHA case number;  
• the Mortgagee has worked with the Borrower to exhaust all applicable Home 
Retention Options and has determined that the Borrower’s case does not meet

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (1) Appraisal Validity  Period  
The appraisal must be valid on the date of the foreclosure  sale. Appraisals are 
valid for 180 Days  from the effective date of the appraisal report . 
(2) Extension to Appraisal Validity Period  
HUD provides an automatic 30 -Day extension from the appraisal expiration date 
for delays due to bankruptcy , court delays, or delays outside of the Mortgagee’s 
control. The Mortgagee must request and obtain HUD approval via EVARS for 
extensions beyond the automatic 30 -Day extension.  
(3) Subsequent Appraisals for Post -Foreclosure  Sales Efforts  
If a Property that had an exterior -only appraisal becomes vacant, the Mortgagee 
must obtain a new appraisal that includes both an interior and exterior inspection 
if: 
• before foreclosure , any delay due to obtaining a new appraisal will not 
cause the foreclosure sale to be canceled; or  
• after foreclosure , the Mortgagee conducts post-foreclosure sales efforts . 
Mortgagees must use an FHA Roster Appraiser to conduct the new appraisal.  
HUD will reimburse the Mortgagee for the cost of one new appraisal following 
vacancy through the FHA insurance claim.  
(4) Required Documentation  
Mortgagees must upload the appraisal information and related FHA case number 
through HUD’s system of record (P260) within 30 Days of the date of the 
appraisal.  
(B) Determining the CAFMV  
After determining the Property’s appraised value using the most recent appraisal, the 
Mortgagee’s authorized employees must access the CAFMV  link in FHA Connection 
(FHAC ) to determine a Property’s CAFMV. The CAFMV remains valid and in effect 
for 120 Days from the date of the appraisal.  
In jurisdictions where the Mortgagee is required to bid a specific amount at 
foreclosure , that amount will be deemed to be the CAFMV  for purposes of the initial 
foreclosure; however, the Mortgagee’s authorized employees must access the 
CAFMV link in FHAC  to determine a Property’s CAFMV for use in any post-
foreclosure sales efforts. 
To facilitate a CWCOT  post-foreclosure  sales effort, the Mortgagee may contribute 
an additional amount needed to raise a third party’s bid to the CAFMV  and allow the

the Mortgagee to facilitate the sale through the FHA insurance claim.  
(C) Damage to the Property after Appraisal  
The Mortgagee must request a variance from the NSC via EVARS to proceed with 
the current appraised value if the Mortgagee becomes aware that the Property

the appeals process required by the CFPB Loss Mitigation regulations under 
RESPA (Regulation X) at 12 CFR  § 1024.4 1. 
The 90 -Day extension begins on the date the Mortgagee denies loss mitigation

• ensure that all the Title  Evidence for Manufactured Housing  requirements are 
met before conveying a Manufactured Home to HUD.  
(H) Property  Assessed  Clean Energy  Obligation Review  
The Mortgagee must:  
• review each Property at the time of foreclosure  referral to determine if the 
Property is encumbered with a PACE  obligation;  
• confirm that any identified PACE  obligation may only become subject to an 
enforceable claim (i.e., a lien) for delinquent, regularly scheduled PACE 
special assessment payments, and otherwise complies with the following 
eligibility and acceptability criteria for Properties with a PACE obl igation:  
o FHA case number must have been assigned prior to January  7, 2018;  
o under the laws of the state where the Property is located, the PACE  
obligation is collected and secured by the creditor in the same manner as 
special assessment taxes against the Property;  
o the Property may only become subject to an enforceable claim (i.e., lien) 
that is superior to the FHA -insured Mortgage for delinquent, regularly 
scheduled PACE  special assessment payments. The Property shall not be 
subject to an enforceable claim (i.e., lien) superior to the FHA -insured 
Mortgage for the full outstanding PACE obligation at any time (i.e., 
through acceleration of the full obligation). However, a n otice of the lien 
for the full PACE obligation may be recorded in the land records;  
o there are no terms or conditions that limit the transfer of the Property to a 
new homeowner. Legal restrictions on conveyance  arising from a PACE  
obligation that could require consent of a third party before the owner can 
convey the Real Property are prohibited, unless such provisions may be 
terminated at the option of, and with no cost to, the homeowner;  
o the existence of a PACE  obligation on a Property is readily apparent to 
Mortgagees, Appraisers, Borrowers, and other parties to an FHA -insured 
Mortgage transaction in the public records and must show the obligation 
amount, the expiration date, and cause of the expiration of the assessment. 
In no case may Default accelerate the expiration date; and  
o in the event of a sale, including a foreclosure  sale, of the Property with 
outstanding PACE  financing, the obligation continues with the Property,

ii. Conduct of Foreclosure  Proceedings  
When foreclosure  is necessary, the Mortgagee must give timely notice to HUD via 
SFDMS and exercise reasonable diligence in processing and completing foreclosure 
proceedings to acquire good marketable title  and possession  of the Property. HUD

Within 30 Days of receiving a Complete Loss Mitigation Request , the 
Mortgagee must review a Borrower’s request for eligibility for Loss 
Mitigation Option s when received more than 37 Days but less than 45 
Days to the scheduled foreclosure  sale date.  
If an incomplete request is received and is not completed despite the 
Mortgagee’s repeated requests to the Borrower for information, the 
Mortgagee may, at its discretion, evaluate an incomplete loss mitigation 
request and offer a proprietary, non -incentivi zed Loss Mitigation Option .

Mortgagee has:  
• verified that a Borrower’s financial situation qualifies them for a Loss 
Mitigation Option ; 
• allowed the Borrower at least 14 Days to consider the Mortgagee’s offer 
of loss mitigation assistance, if the request for loss mitigation was received 
more than 37 Days prior to the scheduled foreclosure  sale date; and  
• received an executed Loss Mitigation Option  agreement, where applicable, 
or sales contract  from the Borrower.  
If state law requires the Mortgagee to cancel a foreclosure  action and then 
requires the Mortgagee to re -initiate the action at a later date, if needed, the 
Mortgagee must request an approval from the NSC via EVARS for an extension 
of time to the first legal action deadline prior to approving the Borrower for loss  
mitigation.  
(3) Communication Between Departments  
The Mortgagee must ensure that strong communication lines are established 
between the Loss Mitigation and Foreclosure  departments to facilitate the 
coordination of loss mitigation efforts and the sharing of documentation and 
information relating to a Borrower’s delinquency. Both departments must be 
aware of when a Borrower’s file is under review for HUD’s Loss Mitigation  
Program.  
(D) Borrower Sale of the Property before Foreclosure  Sale 
HUD encourages the Mortgagee, when possible, to provide the Borrower with an 
opportunity to sell the Property and to provide a reasonable time to complete the sale. 
The Mortgagee should not initiate foreclosure  if it appears that a sale is probable and 
should accept payments tendered while the Property is for sale and before foreclosure 
is started.  
(E) Reasonable Diligence in Completing Foreclosure  
(1) Definition  
The Reasonable Diligence Time Frame is the time period beginning at the earlier 
of the date the first legal action should have been filed in accordance with HUD 
time frames or the date the actual first legal action required by the jurisdiction to 
commence foreclosure  was taken, and ending with the later date of acquiring 
good marketable title  to, and possession of, the Property.

The Mortgagee must exercise reasonable diligence when processing foreclosures 
and acquiring title  to and possession of Properties, in accordance with HUD’s 
Reasonable Diligence Time Frames . 
When circumstances beyond the Mortgagee’s control occur, the Mortgagee may 
treat delays in completing the foreclosure  process as exceptions to the Reasonable 
Diligence Time Frames and may exclude such delays when calculating the time to 
complete a foreclosure if an extension has been granted by HUD.  
(a) Delay due to Use of Loss Mitigation Home Retention Option  
When determining compliance with the Reasonable Diligence Time Frame, 
the Mortgagee may exclude the time that the Borrower was performing under 
an SFB -Unemployment  Agreement  or TPP.  
(b) Delay due to Foreclosure  Mediation  
Where mediation is required after the initiation of foreclosure  but before the 
foreclosure sale, the Mortgagee may exclude the time required to complete the 
mediation when determining compliance with the Reasonable Diligence Time 
Frame.  
(c) Delay due to Active Duty Military Service  
If a Borrower is on Active Duty military service and the Mortgage was 
obtained prior to entry into Active Duty military service, the Mortgagee may 
exclude the period during which the Borrower is on Active Duty military 
service when computing the Reasonable  Diligence Time Frame.  
(d) Delay due to Bankruptcy  
When a Borrower files bankruptcy  after foreclosure  proceedings have been 
initiated, an automatic 90 -Day extension for foreclosure and acquisition of the 
Property will be allowed if:  
• the Mortgagee ensures that all necessary bankruptcy -related legal 
actions are handled in a timely and effective manner;  
• the case is promptly referred to a bankruptcy  attorney after the 
bankruptcy is filed; and  
• the Mortgagee monitors the action to ensure that the case is timely 
resolved through dismissal, termination of the automatic stay, or 
trustee abandonment of all interest in the secured Property.  
The time frame for completing the bankruptcy  action will vary based on the 
chapter under which the bankruptcy is filed.

HUD allows the Mortgagee an additional 90 Days from the date of the 
release of stay of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy  to commence or recommence 
the foreclosure . 
(ii) Chapter 11, 12 , or 13 Bankruptcy  
When the Mortgagee cannot proceed with foreclosure  action because of a 
Chapter 13 (or Chapter 11 or 12) bankruptcy , the Mortgagee must closely 
monitor the payments required by the bankruptcy court. If the Borrower 
becomes 60 Days delinquent in payments required under a Chapter 13 (or 
Chapter 11 or 12) plan, the Mortgagee must ensure that prompt legal 
action is taken t o resolve the matter.  
Any delay the Mortgagee encounters must be fully documented and must 
be beyond the Mortgagee’s control.  
(e) Delay in Acquiring Possession  
When a separate legal action is necessary to gain possession following 
foreclosure , an automatic extension of the Reasonable Diligence Time Frame 
will be allowed to cover the actual time necessary to complete the possessory 
action.  
HUD provides this automatic extension if the Mortgagee takes the first 
required public legal action to initiate the eviction or possessory action within 
30 Days of the later of:  
• the completion of foreclosure  proceedings; or  
• the expiration of federal or local restrictions on eviction.  
The additional time needed under applicable federal, state, or local laws to 
obtain possession of a Property is taken into consideration when evaluating a 
Mortgagee’s compliance with HUD’s Reasonable Diligence Time Frame. 
Upon the expiration period associated with the applicable occupancy  rights, 
Mortgagees are expected to proceed promptly with possessory actions.  
(3) Required Documentation  
The Mortgagee must document in the Servicing File and the Claim Review File 
any delay in completing foreclosure  and all activities performed by the Mortgagee 
to mitigate and abide by these time frames. The Mortgagee must maintain a 
comprehensive audit trail and chronology to support any delay in compliance with 
the Reasonable Diligence Time Frames.  
Where the Mortgagee has submitted a request for an extension of time to the NSC 
via EVARS, the Mortgagee must maintain a copy of the NSC’s written response

(B) Mortgagee Property Preservation and Protection  Action  
(1) Definitions  
Property Preservation and Protection  (P&P) actions are maintenance, security, 
and repair work required by HUD in order to ensure that the Property meets 
HUD’s conveyance condition standards.  
Mortgagee Neglect refers to the Mortgagee’s failure to take action to preserve and 
protect the Property from the time it is determined (or should have been 
determined) to be vacant or abandoned, until the time it is conveyed to HUD.  
(2) Standard  
The Mortgagee must preserve and protect Properties that are the security for 
FHA -insured Mortgages that are in Default or presently in foreclosure . The 
Mortgagee is responsible for the management, scheduling, and execution of all 
activities and actions taken to preserve, secure, maintain and protect the Property, 
regardless of the amount that HUD may reimburse.  
Mortgagees may use any qualified individual or business to perform P&P  services 
on Properties that were secured by FHA -insured Mortgages; however, the 
Mortgagee remains fully responsible to HUD for its actions and the actions of its 
agents, individuals, and firms that performed such services.  
The Mortgagee remains responsible for property damage or destruction to a 
vacant or abandoned Property resulting from Mortgagee Neglect. Such neglect 
includes, but is not limited to:  
• failure to adequately and accurately verify the occupancy status of a 
Property;  
• failure to complete timely and accurate property inspections;  
• failure to promptly and appropriately secure and continue to preserve and 
protect all vacant Properties according to HUD standards; and  
• failure to promptly notify the MCM  of receipt of code violations and 
demolition notices and/or take appropriate action.

i. Definitions  
The Change Date is the effective date of an adjustment to the interest rate, as shown in 
Paragraph 4(A) of the model Adjustable Rate Note  form.  
The Initial Index Figure is the most recent figure available before the Closing Date  of the 
Mortgage.  
The Current Index Figure  is: 
• the most recent index figure available 30 Days before the date of each interest rate 
adjustment, for Mortgages closed before January  10, 2015; and  
• the most recent figure available 45 Days before the date of each interest rate 
adjustment, for Mortgages closed on or after January  10, 2015.  
ii. Adjusting the Interest Rate on an ARM  
To set the new interest rate on an ARM  annually, the Mortgagee must review the 
mortgage documents containing interest rate provisions, and:  
• determine the change between the Initial Index Figure and the Current Index 
Figure ; or 
• add a specified margin to the Current Index Figure . 
Once the new adjusted interest rate is calculated, the Mortgagee must provide notice of 
the change to the Borrower.  
(A) Interest Rate Transition from LIBOR Index to SOFR Index  
For adjustable interest rate Mortgages indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(LIBOR), Mortgagees must transition the Mortgage from LIBOR to the applicable 
Refinitiv United States Dollar (USD) IBOR Consumer Cash Fallback (Refinitiv)

“All-In” CME Term SOFR Rate and select the “Feature” (No Floor).  
The Mortgagee must include a notification to the Borrower of the transition from the 
LIBOR index to the 12 -Month CME Term SOFR replacement index in the ARM  
Adjustment Notice in accordance with the mortgage documents . 
The Mortgagee must calculate the interest rate for each subsequent adjustment to the 
Mortgage using the 12 -Month CME Term SOFR replacement index.  
(B) Determining the Current Index Figure  on an ARM  
The table below describes the Current Index Figure  to use based upon the day of the 
week on which the 30th Day falls.  
When the 30th Day 
falls on a …  AND the 30th Day prior to a 
Change Date…  Then use the index figure 
issued on…  
Monday that is a 
business day  and the issue date of an H.15

(C) Determining the Calculated Interest Rate on an ARM   
The calculated interest rate is the current index plus the margin (the number of Basis 
Points (bps) identified as “margin” in Paragraph 4(C) of the model Adjustable Rate 
Note ), rounded to the nearest 1/8th of one percentage point (0.125 percent).  
(D) Determining the New Adjusted Interest Rate on an ARM  
To determine the new adjusted interest rate, the Mortgagee must compare the 
calculated interest rate to the existing interest rate in effect for the preceding 12 
months.  
(1) Calculated Rate is Equal to Existing Rate  
If the calculated interest rate is equal to the existing interest rate, then the new 
adjusted rate is the same as the existing interest rate.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  (2) Calculated Rate is Less than Existing Rate  
If the calculated interest rate is less than the existing interest rate, then the new 
adjusted rate is:  
• the calculated interest rate for 1 -, 3-, and 5 -year ARMs if the calculated 
interest rate is less than one percentage point higher or lower than the 
existing interest rate; or  
• the calculated interest rate for 5 -, 7-, and 10 -year ARMs if the calculated 
interest rate is less than two percentage points higher or lower than the 
existing interest rate.  
(3) Calculated Rate is More than Existing Rate  
If the calculated interest rate is more than the existing interest rate, then the new 
adjusted rate will be:  
• limited to one percentage point higher or lower than the existing interest 
rate for 1 -, 3-, and 5 -year ARMs, if the new calculated interest rate is more 
than one percentage point (100 bps) higher or lower than the existing 
interest rate. (Note: index chang es in excess of one percentage point may 
not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year); or  
• the calculated interest rate for 5 -, 7- and 10 -year ARMs, if the calculated 
interest rate is more than two percentage points (200 bps) higher or lower 
than the existing interest rate. (Note: index changes in excess of two 
percentage points may not be carri ed over for inclusion in an adjustment in 
a subsequent year).  
(E) Interest Rate Adjustments over the Term of the ARM  
The Mortgagee must not adjust the interest rate over the entire term of the Mortgage 
resulting in a change in either direction of more than:  
• five percentage points (500 bps) from the initial contract interest rate for 1 -, 
3-, and 5 -year ARMs; or  
• six percentage points (600 bps) for 5 -, 7-, and 10 -year ARMs.  
(F) Effective Date of the ARM  Interest Rate Adjustment

for the remaining term of the Mortgage;  
• crediting all eligible prepayments; and  
• not debiting any delinquency.  
To calculate the monthly installment, the Mortgagee must use the scheduled principal 
balance that would be due on the Change Date but reduced by the amount of any 
prepayments made to the principal.  
All ARM  adjustments affect interest rates only; negative amortization is not permitted.  
iv. ARM  Adjustment Notices

the Mortgagee must determine an adjusted interest rate for each omitted year, in order 
to determine the adjusted interest rates for subsequent years, and perform the 
following:  
(1) Interest Rate Increase  
If the Mortgagee’s calculations result in an increase of the interest rate, the 
Mortgagee has forfeited their right to collect the increased amount and the 
Borrowers are relieved from the obligation to pay the increased payment amount.  
(2) Interest Rate Decrease  
If the Mortgagee’s calculations result in a decrease of the interest rate, the 
Mortgagee must refund the excess, plus interest from the date of the excess 
payment to the date of repayment, at a rate equal to the sum of the margin and 
index in effect on the  Change Date.  
The Mortgagee must first apply any refund to any existing delinquency, and if 
excess funds remain, the Mortgagee must, at the Borrower’s request:  
• provide the Borrower with a cash refund; or  
• apply the remaining excess to the unpaid principal balance of the 
Mortgage.

• the Mortgagee miscalculates the interest rate and/or the monthly payment; and  
• the errors are reflected in the notice.  
v. Commencement of Monthly Payment after ARM  Adjustment

branch of the military service until the servicemember’s eligibility is terminated.  
i. Requirements for Section 222 Mortgages  
(A) Military Branch Responsibility  
The military branch is responsible for payment of MIP  on a Section 222 Mortgage 
when the Borrower is:  
• a certified servicemember at the time of application; and  
• the owner of the Property at the time of FHA endorsement.  
(B) Establishing Eligibility  
The servicemember -Borrower must submit the original and two copies of a written 
certification of a servicemember’s eligibility, issued by the servicemember’s 
commanding or personnel officer, with their application for mortgage insurance under

Effective May  4, 2015, HUD removed the regulations for its Section 235 Program, which 
authorized HUD to provide mortgage subsidy payments to Mortgagees to assist lower -
income families who were unable to meet the credit requirements generally applicable to 
FHA mortgage insu rance programs. Authority to insure new Mortgages under Section 235 
expired October  1, 1989. To the extent that any Section 235 mortgages remain in existence, 
or second mortgages for the recapture of subsidy payment pursuant to HUD’s regul ations 
governing the Section 235 Program, the removal of these regulations does not affect the 
requirements for transactions entered into when Section 235 Program regulations were in 
effect. A Borrower with an existing Section 235 Mortgage may still refina nce the Mortgage.  
Section 235 Mortgages have additional servicing requirements due to the Assistance 
Payment Contract. The Mortgagee must continue servicing Section 235 Mortgages in 
accordance with published guidance, preserved here verbatim. Mortgagees should direct 
questi ons regarding Section 235 Mortgage servicing to the NSC . 
i. Section 235 Mortgages  
Formerly HUD Handbook 4330.1, REV -5, Chapter 10  
10-1 GENERAL (24  CFR 235).  Under the Section 235 program, HUD assists mortgagors in 
making their monthly mortgage payments by paying directly to the mortgagee a portion of the 
mortgagor’s monthly payment as long as the mortgagor remains eligible for subsidy under this 
program.  
Servicing of Section 235 mortgages is generally the same as that described in the previous 
chapters of this handbook for mortgages insured under other HUD programs, except this 
program has added requirements due to the assistance payments contract (Subpart  C of 24  CFR 
235).  
A. Mortgages Subject To Recapture (24  CFR, Part 235, Subpart C). Pursuant to a firm 
commitment issued on or after May  27, 1981, all or part of the assistance payments is 
subject to recapture under certain circumstances. (Recaptures and mortgagees’ 
responsibilities with respect to recaptures are discussed in detail in Chapter 11).  
B. Reactivation Of Section 235. The Appropriations Act of 1984 reactivated the Section 235 
program in accordance with Section 226 of the Housing and Urban Rural Recovery Act 
(HURRA) of 1983. The provisions of the reactivated program (which is known as 
Section  235 Revised/Recapture/10), are discussed in Paragraph 10 -36. 
10-2 CONTRACT FOR MONTHLY ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS (24  CFR 235).  The terms 
and conditions of the assistance payment contract are contained in Subpart C of Part 235 of the 
HUD regulations. The issuance of the Mortgage Insurance Certificate (MIC), Form HUD -59100, 
to the HUD -approved mortgagee incorporates these provision s by reference to the contract 
between HUD and the mortgagee.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  7. “Recertification  of Family Income and Composition”. This term means the process 
for determining whether a mortgagor’s household;  
a. continues to qualify for the Section 235 assistance now being received; and/or  
b. is eligible for more or less assistance than is currently being received.  
10-3 CONTRACT FOR MONTHLY ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS UNDER THE 
HOUSING AND URBAN RURAL RECOVERY ACT OF 1983.  The Section 235 
Revised/Recapture/10 Program provides for the following:  
A. an assistance payments contract executed by the mortgagee and HUD which includes the 
“Notice To Buyer”, signed by the mortgagors; and  
B. the mortgagee must submit to the local HUD Field Office having jurisdiction over the 
mortgage the completed and executed contract along with the closing package at the time 
of insurance endorsement. (HUD will execute the contract and return it to the mortgagee 
with the Mortgage Insurance Certificate.)  
10-4 CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.  Once the assistance payments 
contract has been executed and the mortgage insured, many of the initial eligibility requirements 
(such as owning other property, family size, etc.,) no longer restrict the mortgagor’s continuing 
eligibility for assistance.  
A. Requirements To Continue Receiving Assistance. In order to continue receiving 
assistance payments, the mortgagor must meet all four of the following conditions:  
1. Owner -occupancy Continues. Must be a mortgagor (as described in 24  CFR 235.315) 
or a cooperative member (as described in 24  CFR 235.325) and live in the mortgaged 
property;  
a. Co-mortgagors. Where there are co -mortgagors, this requirement will be satisfied 
as long as one co -mortgagor lives in the mortgaged property.  
b. Absentee Occupant. If a mortgagor is away from the mortgaged property for a 
period up to one year this requirement will be satisfied if the absence is due to 
circumstances beyond his/her control and the mortgagor has taken no action 
which would indicate th is property is no longer his/ her primary residence. Each 
case must be decided on its own merit as to whether the circumstances meet the 
occupancy requirement. If additional guidance is needed, the HUD Field Office 
having jurisdiction over the mortgaged property should be contacted. Examp les of 
an “absentee occupant” may include, but not necessarily be limited to, a member 
of the armed forces, and/or a hospitalized mortgagor.  
NOTE: Assistance payments must be suspended where the mortgagor:  
(1) actually collects rent for the mortgaged property;

absence;  
(3) offers the property for rent or sale;  
(4) fails to make the mortgage payments after vacating the property;  
(5) rents another property which the mortgagor is occupying for any reason other 
than for a temporary absence (as described in (1) - (4) above) from his 
mortgaged property;  
(6) purchases and occupies another property (mortgagor or co -mortgagor)  
c. Appointed Trustee/Guardian. In the event of the death of the mortgagor and a 
trustee/ guardian was appointed as the only survivors were minors, this 
requirement may be satisfied if the appointed trustee/guardian lives in the 
mortgaged property with the sur viving minors.  
2. Contract Remains Active. Must be under an assistance payments contract that has not 
been suspended or terminated;  
3. Meets Income Requirements. Mortgagor has insufficient income to make the full 
monthly mortgage payment with 20 or 28 percent of income depending on the firm 
commitment date of the mortgage; and  
NOTE: The 20 percent calculation applies to mortgages insured pursuant to a firm 
commitment issued on or before October  26, 1984. The 28 percent calculation applies 
to mortgages insured pursuant to a firm commitment issued on or after 
October  27, 1984.  
4. Recertifies As Required. Recertifies as to occupancy, employment, family 
composition, and income at least annually and at such other times as required by 
HUD regulations 24  CFR 235.350.  
B. Basis Of Assistance Calculation. If the four conditions cited in Paragraph A above are 
met, only the amount of assistance remains to be calculated. This calculation is based on 
periodic recertifications of income, family composition, occupancy and employment as 
discussed in Paragraph 10 -5. 
C. Disclosure And Verification Of Social Security Number (SSN). The disclosure and 
verification of the SSN is an explicit condition of continued eligibility for Section 235 
assistance. All mortgagors (and members of their households six years of age and older ) 
are required to disclose and verify complete and accurate SSNs in connection with any 
recertification.  
D. Verification Of The SSN Is A One -time Requirement. If a mortgagor provides the 
mortgagee with documentation to verify the SSN at the time of an annual recertification 
(October 1990), it is not necessary to provide the documentation to verify the SSN for 
any subsequent recertifications. However, disclosure of the SSN must be provided at the 
time of each recertification. Mortgagees must advise mortgagors of the requirements in 
writing.

Handbook 4000.1  1378  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  E. Documentation Requirements.  
1. Documentation is required for each SSN disclosed. To document the SSN, all 
individuals should furnish a copy of a valid Social Security Card (SSC) issued by the 
Social Security Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
(The SSN has nin e digits separated by hyphens as follows: 000 -00-0000).  
2. In those cases where the individual is unable to provide a copy of a valid SSC, 
mortgagees may accept copies of any two of the following documents which would 
contain the SSN and the individual’s identity:  
a. A drive r’s license.  
b. An identification card issued by a Federal, state or local agency.  
c. An identification card issued by an employer or trade union.  
d. Earnings statements or payroll stubs.  
e. Bank statements or personal checks.  
f. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099.  
g. Unemployment benefit letter.  
h. Retirement benefit letter.  
i. Life insurance policies.  
j. Court records: such as marriage and divorce judgments or bankruptcy  records.  
k. Other documents that the mortgagee determines adequate evidence of a valid 
SSN.  
F. Individuals who have applied for legalization under the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act of 1986 (IRCA) are an exception to the documentation requirements stated above.  
1. These individuals have a SSN to disclose but will not have the copy of the SSC as 
documentation. Acceptable documentation from those individuals is a letter from the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) assigning them the SSN.  
2. IRCA applicants generally applied for a SSC at the time they applied for amnesty. 
The Social Security Administration assigned these individuals a SSN and issued a 
SSC. However, this card was forwarded to INS and was placed in the applicant’s file. 
INS send s a letter to IRCA applicants informing them that a SSN has been assigned 
and they may use it until they are granted temporary lawful resident status.  
G. Unacceptable Documentation. Mortgagees may not accept documents that:  
1. Are produced or completed by individuals, such as business cards, self completed 
wallet identification cards, or other store purchased cards. (People often purchase a 
plastic or metal SSC from companies or mail order firms.)  
2. Have little or no importance, such as club membership or library cards.  
3. Mortgagees have the discretion to include similar documents in this category.

Handbook 4000.1  1379  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  H. Invalid Or False Documents. A mortgagee may reject documents that are invalid or false. 
To be considered invalid or false, the document must fall under one of the following 
categories:  
1. Invalid Social Security Numbers - Some individuals use invalid numbers taken from 
sample cards put in new wallets or from similar advertising.  
2. False Documents - False Identification documents can be either counterfeit, altered, 
or impostors:  
a. Counterfeit - A forgery of a genuine document or a copy of a document which 
may appear authentic but is not legally issued.  
b. Altered - A genuine document that has had some identification changed to match 
the bearer. Most often the name, photograph, address or age and physical 
description are changed on altered documents.  
c. Imposter - A genuine document obtained under false pretenses, or a blank genuine 
document stolen from the issuing agency.  
I. Procedures For Rejecting SSNs Or Documentation. When a mortgagee suspects that it 
has been given an invalid or false document to evidence the SSN, it should notify the 
homeowner and require an explanation or additional proof of the SSN. If the additional 
documentation is questionable, the mortgagee may require the SSC be provided, or a 
duplicate card obtained if the original is not available. If the additional documentation 
does not satisfy the mortgagee that it is valid or genuine, the following actions mu st be 
taken:  
1. The assistance payments contract must be suspended effective the 1st day of the first 
month after receipt of the additional documentation.  
2. The assistance payments contract cannot be reinstated until the validity of the SSN 
can be verified. The mortgagee must advise the homeowner in writing of the action.  
3. If the validity of the SSN is verified, the assistance payments contract is to be 
reinstated effective the 1st day of the month following receipt of the documentation.  
J. Certifications.  
1. If individuals disclose their SSN, but are unable to meet the verification requirement, 
a written certification must be executed by the individual to this effect. The 
certification should state the individual’s name, SSN, and that he/she is unable to 
submi t the documentation. The certification must be signed, and dated by each 
individual who does not have the documentation. If the individual is under 18 years 
of age, the certification must be executed by his/her parent or guardian.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  2. The individual then has 60 days from the date of certification to obtain necessary 
documentation to verify the SSN disclosed. If an individual is at least 62 years of age, 
the mortgagee may at its discretion, extend the period up to an additional 60 days ( or 
120) days after certification).  
3. The mortgagee may refer the homeowner to the local Social Security Office so that 
he/she may complete and submit Form SS -5, “Application for Social Security Card,” 
to request a duplicate Social Security Card.  
4. If any individual has not been assigned a SSN, a certification executed by that 
individual is required. The certification should state the individual’s name, and that 
he/she has not been assigned a SSN. The individual should then date and sign the 
certific ation. If the individual is under 18 years of age, the certification must be 
executed by/his parent or guardian. This certification is required annually. No further 
action is needed. A mortgagee cannot require an individual to apply for a SSN.  
K. Criminal Violations.  
1. Since the SSN was considered an administrative tool for many years, it was not 
considered necessary to have a penalty provision covering the fraudulent application 
for or use of a SSN. However, as time passed and the SSN came into broader use, the 
need to protect it became more apparent. Penalty provisions were added to the Social 
Security Act and are contained in 42 U. S. C. 408(f), (g) or (h). Violations of these 
statutes include  
a. Providing false information to obtain a SSN.  
b. Using a SSN based on false information to get a federally financed benefit.  
c. Using someone else’s SSN.  
d. Misusing a SSN for any reason.  
e. Making, possessing, buying, or selling counterfeit Social Security cards.  
2. If documentation obtained indicates that the homeowner knowingly intended to 
deceive the mortgagee, referral of the information should be forwarded to the Office 
of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) may 
be contacted b y toll -free hotline: 1 -800-368-5779 or by contacting a Regional 
Inspector General for investigation.  
10-5 RECERTIFICATION OF INCOME, FAMILY COMPOSITION, OCCUPANCY 
AND EMPLOYMENT.  
A. Recertification  Requirements. In an effort to fully apprise mortgagors of their 
responsibility and the importance of reporting all required information timely, 
mortgagees must notify mortgagors of the requirement not only at the time of the annual 
recertification but als o at an additionally specified time within 30 days after the end of 
each calendar year. It is suggested that this be accomplished at the same time the 
mortgagor is provided a statement of the interest paid and the taxes disbursed from the 
escrow account du ring the preceding year.

Handbook 4000.1  1381  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  1. Requirement For All Mortgages (24  CFR 235. 350 and 235. 355). Mortgagees must 
secure recertifications of gross income, family composition, occupancy, and 
employment at least annually and as otherwise required by HUD regulations to ensure 
that the amount of assistance paid on behalf of the mortgagor is that which is 
authorized by statute.  
2. Disclosure and Verification of Social Security Numbers (24  CFR 235.350(d)). 
Mortgagor must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security 
Numbers in connection with any recertification.  
3. Requirement For Mortgages Insured On Or After January  5, 1976. The annual 
recertification must contain a statement of the total gross income (i.e., before 
adjustments and/or deductions) reported for all adult family members living in the 
household as shown on their last federal income tax return s. 
NOTE: If the “total” gross income reported on their last federal income tax return s is 
“individually or collectively” more than 25 percent above the income reported on the 
recertification, the mortgagee must require a written explanation of the difference in 
income from the mortgagor.  
B. Recertification  Form To Be Used. The only acceptable form on which mortgagors and 
their families may recertify is the Form HUD -93101, Recertification of Family Income 
and Composition, Section 235(b). The recertification must include the following:  
1. the signature of at least one mortgagor;  
2. the date of the signatures;  
3. current income, total income for last 12 months and expected income for next 12 
months of all family members;  
4. names and addresses of sources of income for verification purposes; and  
5. Social Security Numbers of all family members 6 years of age and older.  
10-6 WHEN RECERTIFICATIONS ARE REQUIRED (24  CFR 235.350).  
A. Annual Recertifications.  
1. Date Recertification  Must Be Performed. Except where the mortgagor has been 
recertified within 90 days prior to the anniversary (or arbitrary anniversary) date, the 
mortgagee must recertify the mortgagor at least annually on either:  
a. the anniversary date of the first mortgage payment due under the mortgage; or  
b. an arbitrary anniversary date established by the mortgagee for its entire portfolio 
of Section 235 mortgages.  
2. Events Which Permit Recertification  Anniversary Dates To Be Changed. Once 
established, annual and arbitrary anniversary dates are to remain constant except 
when:

Handbook 4000.1  1382  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  a. the mortgage is recast;  
b. the mortgage is transferred to a new mortgagee or servicer; and/or  
c. prior written approval has been obtained from the local HUD Field Office where 
the mortgagee is located with a copy of such approval must be maintained in each 
individual case file. A copy must also be provided as an attachment to the Form 
HUD -93102 assist ance payment request form notifying HUD Headquarters Office 
of Finance and Accounting’s Subsidy Accounting Branch.  
NOTE: When any of the above events occur, the mortgagee or servicer 
automatically has the option of:  
(1) using the anniversary date of the first mortgage payment due under the 
mortgage;  
(2) using the same arbitrary anniversary date (assuming an arbitrary date was 
being used) as the transferring mortgagee or servicer; or  
(3) selecting a different arbitrary anniversary date.  
B. Intermittent Recertifications.  
1. For Mortgages Insured Before January  5, 1976. Recertifications must be done within 
30 days of the effective date of any “addition to” the adult family’s “source of 
income”. An “additional” source of income” may be due to, but not necessarily 
limited to, the following:  
a. a family member (other than a mortgagor) may have reached the age of 21. If this 
family member was a wage earner, this would require that his/her wages now be 
taken into consideration when computing assistance payments;  
b. an adult who did not work previously may have obtained employment;  
c. an adult who had a job may have elected to get an additional part -time job; and/or  
d. a family wage earner may have gotten married.  
e. an adult wage earner joins the family through marriage.  
NOTE: Unless the increase was due to a change in source, the mortgagor needs 
only to recertify at the next anniversary —at which time the increase must be 
reported to the mortgagee.  
2. For Mortgages Insured On Or After January  5, 1976. Recertification  is required 
within 30 days of the date when the total gross income increases by $50 or more per 
month, regardless of whether the source changes.  
It is the mortgagor’s responsibility for providing this information to the mortgagee.  
Mortgagors must be made aware that their failure to advise the mortgagee of an 
increase in income within the 30 -day time frame could result in that mortgagor being 
required to repay a significant amount of overpaid assistance (24  CFR 235. 350(c)).

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  C. Recertifications. At The Direction Of The Secretary Of HUD. The Secretary of HUD, 
and/or his designee, may require recertification any time there is reason to believe 
recertification is warranted (24  CFR 235.350(a)(3)).  
D. Optional Recertifications. At The Request Of The Mortgagor (24  CFR 235.355). The 
mortgagor has the option of requesting that the mortgagee accept a recertification any 
time there is a reduction (of any amount) in the adult family income.  
Should the change not be made within the 30 -day time frame due to the mortgagor’s 
failure to notify the mortgagee, any increase in assistance resulting from income decrease 
will be made effective the first day of the month following the date the recertific ation is 
received by the mortgagee and not retroactively. (24  CFR 235.360).  
1. Acceptable Reasons For Performing Optional Recertifications. The mortgagor may 
request an optional recertification due to, but not necessarily limited to, any of the 
following reasons:  
a. an adult wage earner’s death;  
b. an adult wage earner moving out of the property;  
c. an adult wage earner becoming unemployed; and/or  
d. an adult wage earner’s loss and/or reduction of overtime or salary.  
NOTE: If the mortgagor is already receiving the maximum assistance allowed based 
on income (i.e., maximum allowed under Formula Two), the recertification 
requesting that assistance be increased need not be processed. However, the 
mortgagor must be advised,  in writing, of the reason for the mortgagee’s inability to 
increase the assistance payment.  
2. Time Frame For Making The Request.  
a. In the case of self -employed adult family members, the reduction must have 
continued for at least 90 days prior to the mortgagor’s request for recertification. 
The best information available must be used to ensure that the reduced income 
has been in effect  for 90 days. Assistance must not be based on the unsupported 
word of the mortgagor.  
b. For mortgagors NOT self -employed, the reduction or loss of income must reduce 
the family income to less than the income that was used in computing the most 
recent assistance.  
3. Time Frame for Mortgagee To Process Optional Recertification . The mortgagee must 
request on HUD Form 93101 -A to make any assistance increase effective the first day 
of the month following the month the mortgagor’s recertification is received.  
10-7 ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION OF MORTGAGORS.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  1. no earlier than 60 days before and no later than 30 days after the mortgage (or 
arbitrary) anniversary date; and  
2. the HUD -93101 -A must be received by HUD Headquarters Office of Finance and 
Accounting’s (OFA’s) Subsidy Accounting Branch no later than 45 days after the 
mortgage anniversary (or arbitrary anniversary) date.  
NOTE: The Subsidy Accounting Branch (SAB) will identify as suspended the 
subsidy payments on cases when required annual recertifications are not received by 
the 45th day after the anniversary date. SAB will notify mortgagees by letter that an 
account has been identified as suspended.  
When subsidy is identified as suspended by SAB due to untimely recertification, it 
will not be paid retroactively unless the HUD -93114 request for reinstatement and the 
HUD -93101 -A are accompanied by a statement from the mortgagee. The statement 
must inclu de the reason for mortgagee’s failure to adhere to recertification 
requirements.  
Assistance payments identified as suspended by SAB shall not be retroactively 
reinstated because a mortgagor failed to properly respond to a timely request from the 
mortgagee for recertification.  
For examples of the effective dates of payment changes resultant from 
recertifications, see Paragraph 10 -15C.  
B. “Reasonable Effort” Action Required Of Mortgagee. A reasonable effort must be made 
by the mortgagee to comply with the time frames shown in Paragraph 10 -7A. In order for 
the mortgagee’s actions to meet the “reasonable effort” requirement, the mortgagee’s 
actions must include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:  
1. sending a written notice to the mortgagor, early enough to result in obtaining 
recertification no earlier than 60 days before and no later than 30 days after the 
mortgage anniversary (or arbitrary anniversary) date, which:  
a. advises the mortgagor of the annual recertification requirement;  
b. transmits a Form HUD -93101 that must be filled out and returned to the 
mortgagee;  
c. advises the mortgagor that failure to return the completed HUD -93101 within the 
required time frame will result in suspension of subsidy payments;  
d. advises the mortgagor that assistance payments will not be made retroactively and 
that the mortgagor will be responsible for making the full mortgage payment 
during the period of suspension;  
e. advises the mortgagor that the reinstatement of suspended subsidy payments will 
not be effective until the first payment month which occurs after 30 days from the 
date of the mortgagee’s receipt of HUD -93101 from the mortgagor; and  
f. provides a telephone number and contact name to be used by the mortgagor to 
obtain responses to recertification questions.

recertify due to lack of education, language barrier, physical or emotional 
impairments.  
NOTE: Mortgagees are expected to assist mortgagors in completing forms and/or 
advising relatives or community assistance agencies when mortgagors need assistance 
in filling out forms.  
10-8 MORTGAGOR FAILS TO RECERTIFY WITHIN TIME FRAME (24  CFR 
235.375(b)(4)) . If the mortgagor fails to respond to the mortgagee’s request for recertification 
within the required time frame, the mortgagee is required to request via Form HUD -93114 that 
the HUD Headquarters OFA’s Subsidy Accounting Branch suspend assistance payments 
effective the firs t month after the date that the recertification was required.  
NOTE: The Subsidy Accounting Branch will identify the case as suspended and will not pay 
assistance payments when a recertification is due and neither a HUD -93101 -A nor a HUD -93114 
is received from the mortgagee by the 45th day after the anniversary date.  
A. Mortgagor Recertifies After Suspension. If the recertification is received by the 
mortgagee after assistance payments have been suspended, the mortgagee must submit 
Form HUD -93114, together with HUD -93101 -A, requesting that the assistance payments 
be reins tated as an adjustment transaction Code 2 on the next regular month’s billing 
Forms HUD -93102 and HUD -300. 
NOTE: The billing forms and all adjustment transaction documents (i.e., Forms HUD -
93114, HUD -93101 -A, HUD -93102 and HUD -300) should be submitted as one package 
to the Subsidy Accounting Branch for processing. The reason for the adjustment in 
Column 3 on Form HUD -300 should be noted as “Late mortgagor recertification”.  
The reinstatement will be effective on the first payment month which occurs after the 
date of the mortgagee’s receipt of Form HUD -93101 from the mortgagor.  
NOTE: No assistance will be paid for the period during which a recertification should 
have been received (i.e., 30 days after it was requested) and the date it was actually 
received.  
B. Contract Suspended Due To Mortgagee’s Failure To Meet “Reasonable Effort” 
Requirement. In situations where HUD determines that the action taken by the mortgagee 
when contacting the mortgagor with regard to the recertification fails to meet the 
“reasonable effort” requirement (as stated in Paragraph 10 -7B) and the assistance was 
subsequently suspended, the mortgagee must go back to that mortgagor and allow that 
mortgagor to recertify as long as he/she recertifies within 30 days of this second written 
request . The mortgagee must:  
1. secure recertification and complete verification;

the mortgagee must reconstruct family income as accurately as possible for each 
anniversary date.  
2. make any resulting change in assistance effective retroactive to the period for each 
recertification in question; and  
3. if the recertification results in overpaid assistance, careful consideration must be 
given in order to choose a method which will allow for the recovery of overpaid 
assistance that may have accumulated without creating an undue hardship on the 
mortgagor.  
However, the mortgagee must immediately refund the total overpaid assistance 
amount to HUD. The overpaid amount should be included as an adjustment 
transaction on the next regular month’s billing which should be accompanied by 
applicable Forms HUD -93114 (r equesting reinstatement) and HUD -93101 -A 
(recertifying income). The periods of overpayment (i.e., month and year) must be 
included in Column 3 of Form HUD -300. The reason for adjustment should be noted 
as “Late Recertification  Request”.  
NOTE: When assistance has been suspended and a request for reinstatement is 
retroactive, the current monthly billing amount should be treated as a Code 1 
transaction on Form HUD -300. The retroactive billing amount should be treated as a 
Code 2 adjustment t ransaction on Form HUD -300. 
Both the reason for adjustment (i.e., late mortgagor recertification, recertification 
request; suspended in error, etc.) and the beginning and ending effective period 
(month and year) must be included in Column 3 of Form HUD -300. Failure to 
provide this in formation or failure to attach the required Forms HUD 93101 -A and 
HUD -93114, as appropriate, will result in non -payment of the adjustment amount.  
Disallowed adjustment amounts due to lack of documentation must be included on 
the next regular month’s billing. The HUD Headquarters OFA’s Subsidy Accounting 
Branch will process only one Form HUD -93102 for each billing period.  
10-9 DETERMINING INCOME.  
A. Gross Annual Income (24  CFR 235.5(d)). Assistance is based on gross income which is 
made up of the total income (prior to any adjustments, taxes or other deductions) received 
by all members of the mortgagor’s household.  
NOTE: Members of the mortgagor’s “family or household” are considered to be all 
persons living in the mortgaged property who are related to the mortgagor by blood, 
marriage or operation of law.  
1. Income Sources Included. For the purposes of annual or other required 
recertifications which project income, the following sources must be included:

b. Social Security or welfare benefits;  
c. retirement benefits, military and veterans’ usability benefits;  
d. unemployment benefits;  
e. interest and dividend payments;  
f. lottery winnings paid over extended periods; and  
g. insurance benefits paid on a fixed schedule.  
2. Income Sources Excluded. Income from the following sources must NOT be 
included:  
a. lump sum insurance benefits;  
b. lump sum winnings from a lottery;  
c. hospital or other medical insurance benefits;  
d. bonuses and/or overtime (if they DO NOT represent a pattern of annual payments 
over a period of time);  
e. food stamps;  
f. scholarships; or  
g. any unusual income such as payments made to Vietnam Veterans from the Agent 
Orange Settlement Fund.  
NOTE: The Agent Orange Compensation Exclusion Act (Public Law 101 -201) 
requires that none of the payments made to Vietnam Veterans from the Agent 
Orange Settlement Fund be considered income for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for or the amount of be nefits under any Federal or federally assisted 
program. This requirement must be adhered to when processing Section 235 
Annual or other required Recertifications of Family Income and Composition.  
h. any temporary income such as income of a wage earner from temporary 
employment that has been discontinued at the time recertification is taking place.  
B. Income Requiring Special Consideration. The mortgagee is to use the mortgagor’s 
verified current income or the mortgagor’s stated “expected income”, WHICHEVER IS 
HIGHER.  
“Expected income” is different from income received over the past 12 months (or year -
to-date income) in that if there has been a recent increase in the mortgagor’s (and/or 
family member’s) hourly wage or salary, that new hourly rate or salary would serve a s 
the basis for projecting the “expected income” for the next 12 -month period.  
1. Overtime Pay. Overtime pay must be included in the total income if the employer 
verifies that overtime is currently being paid on a regular basis regardless of whether 
the employee states (or fails to state) at the time of verification that the overtime is  
expected to continue in the future. If there is a continuing record of overtime work, 
the only time the overtime income is to be excluded is when the employer verifies 
that overtime will be discontinued.

Handbook 4000.1  1388  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  2. Self-Employment. Include in gross income all income listed on Internal Revenue 
Service’s (IRS) Form 1040. When calculating the income of self -employed 
mortgagors, the deductions set out in Schedule C, Profit (or Loss) from Business or 
Profession, must be r ecalculated for HUD purposes. Salary or wage distributions for 
the mortgagor or co -mortgagor, depletion or depreciation) are not deducted from the 
gross business income for HUD purposes.  
NOTE: For example, Schedule C is not the only form where self -employment income 
is claimed, farmers may have a Schedule F instead of a Schedule C. All sources of 
self-employment income must be included.  
a. Recalculate Business Income On IRS Form 1040. Mortgagees must recalculate 
the business income (Item 12 on IRS’ Form 1040). If the recalculated income 
shows a loss, that loss cannot be used to offset other forms of income reported on 
Items 7 through 22 on IRS Form 1040.  
b. Item 12 on the mortgagor’s IRS Form 1040 may reflect a negative amount in 
some cases. However, when the mortgagee recalculates the Schedule C as 
prescribed in Paragraph 2a above, it could result in a positive amount to be 
included in income. Elimination of  the deductions for depletion and depreciation 
may, from HUD’s perspective, result in a business profit.  
3. Special -Purpose Payments. These are payments made to the mortgagor’s household 
that would be discontinued if not spent for a specific purpose. Payments which are 
intended to defray specific expenses of an unusual nature and which are expended 
solely for th ose expenses should not be considered as income. Examples include, but 
are not necessarily limited to, the following:  
a. Medical Expenses. Funds provided by a charitable organization to defray medical 
expenses, to the extent to which they are actually spent to meet those expenses.  
b. Foster Children. Payments for the care of foster children who are not otherwise 
related to the mortgagor’s household by blood, marriage, or operation of law.  
NOTE: Foster children are not considered members of the family. Therefore, no 
$300 adjustments to income are to be made because of their presence.  
c. VA Educational Benefits and/or Scholarships. VA educational benefits and/or the 
proceeds of scholarships are not considered income to the extent the benefits or 
proceeds are actually used for educational expenses (i.e., tuition, books, lab fees, 
etc.). Any  excess income after deducting actual educational expenses must be 
included as income.  
NOTE: Costs of transportation to and from school or for cost of housing for living 
away from home to attend school are not considered educational expenses.

Handbook 4000.1  1389  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  d. Payments In Kind. Items such as food stamps, meals, clothing, or transportation 
provided by the employer is not considered as income if used for that expressed 
purpose. However, cash reimbursement for any of these items is considered as 
income to the exten t it continues when not spent to defray a specific expense.  
e. Insurance Benefits.  
(1) Health/Accident/Disability Insurance.  
(a) Premiums Paid By Mortgagor. Benefits received from policies where the 
mortgagor is both the insured and the beneficiary are not to be considered 
income if the mortgagor paid the premiums.  
(b) Premiums Not Paid By Mortgagor. If these premiums were paid by 
someone outside the mortgagor’s household (such as an employer), the 
benefits would be considered as income.  
(2) Other Types of Insurance. The benefits of other type insurance policies would 
be considered as income if the benefits are paid in two or more installments 
unless they meet the test of special purpose payments as described in 
Paragraph 10 -9B3 above.  
Regardless of the type or reason for payment, insurance benefits paid in a 
lump sum are not to be considered income. However, if the mortgagor chose 
to invest any or all of the money from this lump sum payment, all interest (or 
other gain) from this invest ment would be considered as income.  
f. Earnings of Minors. Income of all family members within the mortgagor’s 
household must be included in the family’s total gross income which is used as a 
base for computing the assistance.  
All income of all members of the family is included in gross family income. In 
arriving at the family’s adjusted income, five percent of this total is subtracted 
before subtracting the earnings of minors. Note that only the earnings of minors 
are subtracte d. Income of minors from sources other than earnings is not 
subtracted.  
For example, income to a minor from a trust or an insurance policy is not earnings 
and is not subtracted. It is thus immaterial whether income other than earnings is 
paid to a minor or to an adult family member for the benefit of the minor. In 
neither case  would it be deducted in arriving at adjusted income.  
g. Military Pay and Allowances. All cash payments to a member of the armed forces 
are considered as income, regardless of the reason for the payment, unless the 
payment is made only once and for a special purpose, such as a lump sum re-
enlistment bonus.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  Many military personnel may exercise a degree of choice in some areas of 
compensation. For example, they may choose between eating in a government 
cafeteria without charge or receiving an allowance for rations in cash and paying 
for any meals consumed in t he cafeteria. If the allowance is received in cash, it is 
income. Otherwise, it is not.  
h. Reimbursement for Expenses. If the family member’s employment requires 
spending considerable time away from home on a regular basis and the employer 
provides reimbursement for the unusual living expenses incurred as a result, the 
reimbursement is not norma lly considered to be income.  
Exceptions to this rule:  
(1) If the reimbursement is paid for periods other than when the employee is 
actually away from home, the entire reimbursement is considered as income 
regardless of whether the employee accounts to the employer for actual 
expenses and the reimbursement is fixe d on a daily basis (or some other 
standard) and is inadequate to cover all normal living expenses; and  
(2) if the employee accounts to the employer for expenses, and the expenses equal 
or exceed the reimbursement, the reimbursement is not considered income. 
However, if the reimbursement exceeds the expenses, the excess 
reimbursement is considered income.  
NOTE: Where expenses exceed the reimbursement, the amount not covered 
by the reimbursement cannot be deducted from the family’s gross annual 
income.  
10-10 VERIFYING INCOME.  To calculate assistance payments, the mortgagor’s verified 
current income, or the reported expected income, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER, must be used. The 
mortgagor’s option to recertify is his/her only protection when there is a loss of income. When 
mortgagees f ail to use the highest income reported, overpaid assistance results.  
A. Third -party Verification Required. Third -party verification of the mortgagor’s statements, 
similar to that required when a mortgage is originated, is required at the time of each 
recertification.  
EXCEPTION: Third -party verifications are not required for self -employed persons.  
B. Verification Not Available. Where third -party verification cannot be obtained and/or the 
mortgagor’s statements cannot be reconciled with the verification, the local HUD Field 
Office having jurisdiction over the mortgaged property should be contacted for a ssistance 
in establishing the income.  
C. Unacceptable Forms Of Verification. Examples of unacceptable forms of verification 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  1. Federal income tax return s or Forms W -2’s (withholding tax forms), except for self -
employed persons and where HUD has reviewed the case and has established that this 
would be the best information available;  
2. where verifications have passed through the hands of the mortgagor and/or the person 
whose income is being verified; and/or  
3. checks and/or pay stubs which show only the net amount of the check.  
D. Acceptable Forms Of Verification. The most difficult part of income verification is 
determining that all sources of earned income have been reported by all members of the 
mortgagor’s household.  
1. Listed below, ranked in the order of preference, are acceptable forms of verification 
for earned income.  
a. Pay Stubs and Checks. If these show gross income as well as net, these documents 
are considered to be the most reliable source of accurate information concerning 
recent income.  
(1) Documentation for Preceding Six months Is To Be Requested. The most 
recent information available is to be used for recertifications. Salary 
information requested should include at least any pay stubs and/or copies of 
check(s) received by any household memb er just prior to the mortgagee’s 
request as well as any checks or income received within at least the last six -
month period.  
(2) Each Source of Income Must be Documented. Care should be taken to assure 
that the mortgagor provides information with respect to each source of 
income. If a source is missing, one of the other forms of verification should be 
used with respect to that sourc e. 
b. HUD Form 92004 -G Request for Verification of Employment. This form of 
verification is acceptable (or similar forms designed by the mortgagee to elicit the 
same information) only if it is delivered directly to and from the employer without 
passing through t he hands of the mortgagor and/or the employee whose salary is 
being verified.  
NOTE: If the HUD form is used, it should be modified to add, in the remarks 
section, a request for information about anticipated wage increases.  
c. Telephone Verification. While some employers may be reluctant to provide 
income information by telephone, they will usually verify that the mortgagor is or 
is not employed with that company. In using the telephone:  
(1) Contact Designated Personnel. It should be established by the mortgagee that 
the person spoken to is either:

(b) an employee of that company who has been authorized by that company to 
give out employment verifications.  
(2) Maintain Mortgagor’s Privacy. The detailed reason for the call (i.e., to 
determine if the employee remains eligible for Sections 235 subsidy) should 
not be disclosed to any parties other than those described in the preceding 
paragraph.  
(3) Document Telephone Call. Each telephone call should be fully documented as 
follows:  
(a) the date;  
(b) the time;  
(c) the parties of the conversation; and  
(d) the information provided by the employer.  
d. Use of Standard Benefit Scales. Some localities have established that a family 
with a given composition receiving public assistance  or unemployment 
compensation as its sole source of income must receive assistance in a set amount.  
NOTE: Where this is the case, the income taken from the current schedule of 
benefits established by that source may be accepted as the family’s income 
without individual verification of the benefits.  
e. Use of Public Housing Authority’s Standard Minimum Income Scales. Some 
Public Housing Authorities have established schedules of minimum incomes for 
various occupations in their areas, especially those with fluctuating, seasonal, and 
irregular patterns. The se schedules are based on experience indicating that 
workers in each of the covered occupations can be expected to earn at least a 
minimum each year under normal working conditions.  
(1) Income Reported At Or Above Minimum Scale. If the mortgagor has stated an 
income at or above the minimum found in these tables, the mortgagor’s 
statement may be accepted without further verification.  
(2) Income Reported At Less Than Minimum Scale. Where the mortgagor can 
provide convincing evidence that a lower income is accurate, the lower figure 
may be used.  
2. Income from Self -Employment. As noted in Paragraph 10 -9 with respect to self -
employment, the income of self -employed persons must often be adjusted to avoid 
reducing it for non -cash expenditures such as depletion and depreciation. Supporting 
documentation (such as statements showing deposits consistent with claimed income) 
should be obtained from self -employed mortgagors.

Handbook 4000.1  1393  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  a. Audited Profit and Loss Statements. A copy of the latest audited Profit and Loss 
Statement may be requested from the mortgagor.  
NOTE: Due to the expense involved, mortgagors are not to be required to obtain 
an audited Profit and Loss Statement for the sole purpose of the mortgagee using 
it for income verification to determine Section 235 subsidy. However, should a 
recent audited Pr ofit and Loss Statement exist for other purposes, the mortgagee 
may require that a copy be provided for income verification.  
b. Unaudited Profit and Loss Statements. These are acceptable only if prepared by 
someone other than the mortgagor. Even then, they are of questionable validity as 
they are based solely on information provided to the preparer by the mortgagor. 
Any apparent di screpancy should be followed up thoroughly.  
c. Financial Statements. A financial statement is a picture of the financial condition 
of the business at a specific time. It must be noted that a financial statement does 
not provide information about the income of the mortgagor, but only serves as a 
basis f or determining that the business can afford to pay the mortgagor what is 
claimed as earned income.  
NOTE: When the self -employed mortgagor is a principal owner of a corporation, 
that person’s income is generally a combination of salary and dividends on 
investment in the corporation.  
In these situations, the corporation’s undistributed earnings should also be 
considered as income of the mortgagor to the extent of that person’s ownership.  
3. Unearned Income. Income from sources other than employment or self -employment 
must also be verified, and there are probably as many ways to do this as there are 
different sources of income. It is left to mortgagees to determine the best source of 
informati on in each case.  
E. Verification Not Required. Certain types of income need not be verified.  
1. Minors. Incomes of minors (persons living in the household who are under the age of 
21) need not be verified. Only the income of “adult” members of the family need be 
verified. “Adult” for this purpose is any mortgagor and spouse of any mortgagor 
(regardle ss of age) and any other person related to any mortgagor by blood, marriage, 
or operation of law who occupies the mortgaged property and is 21 years old or older.  
2. Latest Verification Performed Within Last Six Months. On mortgages insured prior to 
January  5, 1976, income which has been verified within the six months preceding the 
mortgagee’s receipt of the signed Form HUD -93101 need not be verified if:  
a. the family members report no change in employers; and  
b. the income reported is either the same as that verified earlier or reflects a change 
which was expected and/or verified as a part of the previous verification.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  3. Disqualifying Income. If either the current or expected income as reported by the 
mortgagor is adequate to enable the mortgagor to make the full monthly payment 
with 20 or 28 percent of income (depending on when the mortgage was insured), no 
further verifi cation is necessary before suspending the assistance payments contract.  
10-11 FAMILY COMPOSITION.  Family composition need not be verified, but, all changes in 
the status of adult and family members must be questioned.  
A. Separations. Where a mortgagor has left the property due to a separation, the remaining 
mortgagor may certify as to the composition of the remaining portion of the household.  
B. Death. Normally, if there is no owner -mortgagor occupying the property, assistance 
cannot be paid. In the event of the death of one or more mortgagors, there could be a 
question as to both the title  to the property and the mortgage obligation. The status may 
be even more uncertain if the only survivors are minor children.  
1. Obtaining Clear Title /Disposing of Property. Where the only survivors are minor 
children, it may be necessary to initiate court proceedings in order to have a guardian 
appointed for the purpose of clearing and/or disposing of the title of the property.  
2. Commencement of Assistance Payments. In the event of a death or separation leaving 
no owner -mortgagor, the mortgagee may begin billing for assistance immediately as 
though there had been an assumption at the time of the death or separation, provided 
the mo rtgagee can identify an individual who meets all of the following conditions:  
a. is a member of the surviving family (even though he/or she may not have 
qualified as a “family” member for assistance purposes earlier);  
b. will probably become the holder of title  (either in his/her own name or in trust for 
one or more of the survivors);  
c. will assume the mortgage obligation in the same capacity;  
d. will occupy the mortgaged property with the survivors; and  
e. will qualify for assistance within the limits prescribed for initial eligibility (see 
Paragraph 10 -22). 
3. Establishing Eligibility. It must be recognized that to determine who will most likely 
inherit or be appointed as a guardian or trustee on behalf of the survivors before the 
estate is settled can only be based on assumptions . Once the mortgagee can 
reasonably determine who that individual will be and whether the conditions in 
Paragraph 10 -11B2 have been met, eligibility must be established.  
NOTE: Establishing eligibility need not be delayed until the disposition of title  has 
been completed and the mortgage obligation is formally assumed by the new 
mortgagor.  
Should it become evident that those assumptions  are incorrect, the assistance 
payments contract must be suspended effective with the date of death or separation 
and any assistance paid in the interim must be refunded to HUD.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  10-12 COMPUTING ASSISTANCE (24  CFR 235.335). The maximum monthly assistance 
that can be paid by HUD is the lesser amount computed under two formulas, commonly referred 
to as “Formula One” and “Formula Two”. Instructions for these computations are given on Form 
HUD -93101 -A under Section A and B.  
A. Formula One. The “Formula One” assistance payment is the difference between the full 
monthly mortgage payment (i.e., principal, interest, and all escrowed items) due under 
the mortgage and either 20 or 28 percent of the mortgagor’s adjusted monthly income.  
(See Section A and B of the Form 93101 -A to determine how the assistance payment is 
computed .) 
NOTE: The 20 percent calculation applies to mortgages pursuant to a firm commitment 
issued on or before October  26, 1984. The 28 percent calculation applies to mortgages 
insured pursuant to a firm commitment issued on or after October  27, 1984.  
The “Formula One” payment must be recomputed whenever there is a change in the total 
payment or when there is a change in the income or family composition reflected in a 
recertification.  
B. Formula Two. The “Formula Two” assistance payment is the difference between the 
actual monthly payment to principal, interest, and the mortgage insurance premium 
(MIP ) under the mortgage and the monthly payment to principal and interest (without the 
MIP) that the mortgagor would have to pay if the mortgage bore interest at some lower 
rate. Those lower rates vary, depending on when the mortgage was insured, as indicated  
below:

verification of all or part of the family’s income at the time of the effective date of a change in 
the assistance payment, the assistance payment should be temporarily adjusted, if appropriate,

verified or until the local HUD Field Office makes a decision as to the amount of assistance to be 
paid based on available documentation.  
A. Basis For Computing Interim Assistance Payments. Interim changes in assistance 
payments should be based on the highest family income figure which can be developed 
from any source (or sources) until the mortgagor’s family income can be verified or a 
decisio n is made by the local HUD Field Office.  
B. Affect On Payments. Interim changes in assistance payments should:  
1. not result in overpayment of subsidy unless the mortgagor understates income;  
2. result in the Formula One assistance (after verification) being equal to or greater than 
the interim adjustment; and  
3. not affect Formula Two calculations as the Formula Two are not income related.  
C. HUD Assistance Requested. Whenever acceptable verifications cannot be obtained, the 
local HUD Field Office should be asked to make a decision as to the total family income 
to be used to determine the amount of assistance to be paid on behalf of the mortgag or. 
D. Documentation Needed. Requests to local HUD Field Offices for assistance in 
determining correct assistance should include:  
1. Form HUD -93101, Recertification  of Family Income and Composition, Section 
235(b);  
2. all income verifications received to date that pertain to this recertification, including 
summaries of any received verbally;  
3. copies of any correspondence related to the recertification or verification of income.  
4. a summary of any attempted verifications or reconciliation of differences may not 
have been made clear by the basic documentation; explain the problem encountered; 
and 
5. the names, addresses and telephone numbers of any income source identified by or 
for any family member.  
10-14 FIRST MONTHLY ASSISTANCE PAYMENT . Where mortgage closings do not take 
place on the first day of a month, the first assistance payment on a new mortgage will normally 
be smaller or larger than subsequent assistance payments (depending on how interest for the first 
partial month is collect ed from the mortgagor).  
If the interest is collected at closing or as a separate payment of interest only on the first of the 
month following closing, the initial assistance payment will be smaller. If the interest is collected 
as a part of the first full monthly installment, bot h that payment and the assistance payment will 
be larger.  
In calculating this first assistance payment, the mortgagee’s basic calculations are the same. Both 
“Formula One” and “Formula Two” assistance payments are to be calculated, but the

10-15 ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS ADJUSTMENTS (24  CFR 235.360) . Most adjustments 
take place as a result of changes in income or family composition reflected in a recertification or 
due to an increase in the full monthly payment required by the mortgage.  
A. Adjustments. Assistance payment adjustments will be made either retroactively or 
prospectively as described below.  
1. Retroactively. Assistance payments may be adjusted retroactively (i.e., adjusted back 
to the date the change should have taken effect). Payments may be adjusted 
retroactively under the following circumstances:  
a. to correct errors or to include previously unreported income (i.e., $50.00 
increases);  
b. to reinstate a suspended assistance payments contract when:  
(1) there is an assumption and the assumptor is found eligible for assistance; or  
(2) a foreclosure  action is withdrawn;  
c. when an “interim” assistance payment was put into effect in accordance with 
Paragraph 10 -13; and  
d. when directed to do so by HUD.  
2. Prospectively. Most assistance payments will be adjusted prospectively (i.e., 
adjustments made effective within 30 days after the processing of recent or 
anticipated changes when reported by the mortgagor as required). These changes may 
be due to, but not necessarily limited to, the following:  
a. changes in income or family composition reflected in a recertification; or  
b. an increase in the full monthly payment required under the mortgage.  
B. Computation Changes. “Formula Two” assistance payments change every twelve months 
(on the anniversary of the beginning of amortization) at the time MIP  changes for the 
coming year.  
NOTE: This adjustment must be made even when the mortgagee has established an 
arbitrary anniversary date for the purpose of processing recertifications.  
C. Effective Dates Of Changes (24  CFR 235. 360). The effective date of payment change 
recorded in Block 19 on Form HUD -93101 -A must be in accordance with the following 
schedule:

10-16 ADVISING MORTGAGORS OF CHANGES . The mortgagee must notify the 
mortgagor of changes in assistance payments no less than 10 days before the due date of the first 
payment affected by the change.  
A. Required Advance Notice Not Given. Any time there is an increase in the mortgagor’s 
share of the payment and the required 10 -day advance notice cannot be given to the 
mortgagor, the mortgagee must arrange a schedule that is acceptable to both parties (must  
be one that is realistic and does not put an undue hardship on the mortgagor) for 
collecting any additional amounts that may become due before the 10 -day advance notice 
period can be given.  
NOTE: Payment schedule arrangements made between the mortgagor and the mortgagee 
should not result in overpaid assistance. The amount of assistance requested from HUD 
on Form HUD -93102 should be reduced effective on the effective date of payment 
change in accordance with the schedule provided in Paragraph 10 -15C, regardless of 
when the mortgagee collects the higher mortgagor’s share of the monthly payment 
amount.  
B. Written Notice To Mortgagor. The notice to the mortgagor should include, but not 
necessarily be limited to, the following information:  
1. the total monthly mortgage payment, excluding items not required by the mortgage 
(such as premiums for life and/or disability insurance);  
2. HUD’s share of the mortgage payment and whether it was computed under “Formula 
One” or “Formula Two”;  
3. the mortgagor’s share of that payment;  
4. any additional amounts that must be paid by the mortgagor in connection with the 
mortgage payment which was excluded in Item 1 above (such as premiums for life 
and/or disability insurance);

6. the due date of the first payment due from the mortgagor which reflects the increase.  
10-17 RETENTION OF DOCUMENTATION (24  CFR 235.365) . Form HUD -93114 and all 
other pertinent records must be in the mortgagor’s case file for the life of the insured mortgage 
plus three years. In the event the mortgage is transferred to another mortgagee or servicer, and/or 
assigned to HUD, this documentati on must remain a part of the mortgagor’s case file and must 
be conveyed to the new mortgagee, servicer, and/or HUD which shall retain the entire case file 
for the life of the mortgage plus [seven] years. In addition, a mortgagee must transfer 
documentation noting the Borrower’s preferred method of communicating or language 
preference in the event the mortgage is transferred to another mortgagee or servicer.  
10-18 SUSPENSION OF ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS (24  CFR 235. 375).  
A. Events Which Require Suspension. Events listed below (and are also given under Item 15 
of Form HUD -93114 require the suspension of assistance payments. Effective dates are 
also given as to when each is to be suspended.  
1. When the mortgagor or cooperative member ceases to meet the occupancy criteria for 
continued assistance;  
Effective Date: the first day of the month following the date the mortgagor or 
cooperative member ceased to meet the criteria;  
2. The mortgagee determines that the mortgagor or cooperative member ceases to 
qualify for assistance payments because of income increases enabling the mortgagor 
or cooperative member to pay the full monthly payments using 20 or 28 percent 
(whichever applies)  of the family income.  
Effective Date: the date that the mortgagor received the increase in family income 
which enabled payment of the full monthly mortgage payment with 20 or 28 percent 
of the adjusted gross family income;  
3. The required recertification of occupancy, employment, income and family 
composition cannot be obtained from the mortgagor.  
Effective Date: For annual recertifications, the assistance payment contract must be 
suspended if the recertification Form HUD -93101 has not been received 30 days after 
the anniversary date, or the disclosure and verification of the Social Security numbers  
are not provided. For other required recertifications, the contract is suspended as of 
the first day of the month following expiration of the 30 -day period given the 
mortgagor for recertification.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  NOTE: Assistance payments are not to be suspended when a mortgagor requests 
recertification due to a reduction in income (i.e., optional recertification), and then 
fails to recertify.  
4. Mortgage obligation or cooperative membership is assumed by a party before 
eligibility has been established.  
Effective Date: The first day of the month following the date on which the seller fails 
to meet the occupancy criteria as set out in paragraph, or the assumptor assumes the 
mortgage or cooperative membership, whichever is earlier.  
5. Foreclosure  is initiated.  
Effective date: The first day of the month following the date the first legal action 
required by state law is taken by the mortgagee’s attorney to foreclose on the 
mortgage.  
B. Suspension Notification Required. A notice shall be sent to the mortgagor advising of the 
suspension when:  
1. the suspension of assistance payments is the result of a mortgagor being able to make 
the full monthly payment using the appropriate 20 or 28 percent of family income;  
2. the mortgagor fails to submit a required recertification; or  
3. the mortgagor fails to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social 
Security numbers in connection with a recertification.  
C. Content Of Suspension Notice. The notice to the mortgagor must include the following:  
1. the date of the suspension;  
2. the reason for suspension (as stated in Paragraph 10 -18A);  
3. the mortgagor’s total required monthly mortgage payment;  
4. a statement advising that for a period of 3 years immediately following the 
suspension, assistance payments may be reinstated at any time within that 3 -year 
period if:  
a. circumstances occur which would eliminate the reason for the suspension; and  
b. provided that another event (listed in Paragraph 10 -18A) has not taken place 
which would in itself require that the assistance payment contract continue to be 
suspended.  
D. Reinstatement Effective Dates. A suspended assistance payment contract shall be

effective the first day of the month after the mortgagee receives Form HUD -93101 
notification that the mortgagor is no longer “over income” and meets all other 
continued eligibi lity criteria.  
NOTE: Reinstatement may be as a result of a reduction in the mortgagor’s family 
income and/or due to an increase in the total monthly mortgage payment (such as an 
increase in amount being escrowed).  
3. Suspension Due To Mortgagor’s Failure to Recertify. Assistance payments may be 
reinstated effective the first day of the month after the mortgagee receives the 
required Form HUD -93101.  
4. Suspension Due To Mortgagor’s Failure to Disclose and Verify Social Security 
Numbers (24  CFR 235.375(b)(4)). Assistance payments may be reinstated effective 
the first day of the month after the mortgagee receives the social security number 
information.  
5. Suspension Due To Initiation of Foreclosure . Upon the withdrawal of foreclosure 
action, assistance payments may be reinstated retroactively to the date of suspension 
provided that, during the period the assistance payments were suspended, the 
mortgagor continued to meet all other criteria for recei ving assistance payments.  
a. Negotiation of Reinstatement Terms. The terms of reinstatement of the mortgage 
(i.e., whether the delinquency is to be paid in a lump sum, or additional sums are 
to be paid each month until the mortgage is current etc. ,) may be negotiated 
between the mort gagee and the mortgagor. However, the terms agreed upon must 
be realistic and may not affect the monthly mortgage payment on which the 
Formula One assistance payment is based.  
b. Reimbursement of Foreclosure  Costs. Mortgagee retains the right to be 
reimbursed by the mortgagor for any costs incurred with respect to the withdrawn 
foreclosure action. However, these costs must be kept separate and apart from any 
Section 235 assistance. These costs may not be adde d to the monthly mortgage 
payment used to calculate the assistance payments and may not be billed to HUD 
as a separate item.  
10-19 TERMINATION OF ASSISTANCE PAYMENT CONTRACT (24  CFR 235.375).  
A. Events Which Require Termination. Events are listed below (and also given under Item 
16 of HUD -93114) which require the termination of the assistance payment contract:  
1. when the contract of mortgage insurance is terminated;  
EXCEPTION: The assistance payment contract is not terminated because HUD 
accepts an assignment of the mortgage.

years without the subsidy being reinstated within that three -year period of suspension; 
or 
4. when the assistance payment contract for Section 246 10 -year mortgages terminate 
unless extended by the Secretary.  
B. Termination Effective Dates. Assistance payment contracts terminated for the events 
cited in the preceding paragraph shall be made effective the first day of the month 
following the date of the event which requires the termination of the contract.  
C. Contracts Terminated In Error. Where the assistance payment contract is terminated in 
error, the mortgagee shall reinstate the contract immediately upon discovering the error. 
Form HUD -93114 must be submitted with the box checked under Item 17(1). (Item 17(1) 
denotes “Terminated in Error” as the reason for the reinstatement.) Documentation of the 
error is to be retained in the mortgagor’s case file for the life of the mortgage.  
NOTE: Once a Section 235 assistance payment contract has been properly terminated it 
may not be reinstated.  
10-20 ESCROW ACCOUNTS.  Basically escrow accounts for Section 235 mortgages are 
serviced the same as escrow accounts for other insured mortgages (i.e., in accordance with 
procedures discussed in Chapter 2). However, certain differences will be encountered. 
Mortgagees must determ ine which escrow items and/or what portion of the premium for an 
acceptable escrow item may be included in the total monthly mortgage payment prior to 
computing the amount of subsidy the mortgagor is entitled to under the Section 235 program. 
Guidance for making this determination is as follows:  
A. Escrow Items Which May Be Included In Assistance Computations. Only certain items 
required under the mortgage may be included in the assistance computations. The escrow 
items that are acceptable, and the guidelines for determining the acceptable portion of  the 
premium for that escrow item (if the entire amount cannot be included) are listed below:  
1. Hazard Insurance . Only the cost of either the standard fire and extended coverage or 
basic homeowner’s policy may be included in the assistance calculations. If a basic 
homeowner’s policy is used, the mortgagee must be sure that any premiums for other 
items, such as cars,  boats or other properties are not included in the assistance 
calculations. If the cost of the basic homeowner’s policy appears excessive, the 
mortgagee must contact the agent and establish the cost of a standard fire and 
extended coverage policy and use t he lesser of the two.  
NOTE: Do not include disability or life insurance premiums.  
2. Flood Insurance . The entire premium may be included in the computation if the 
insurance is required by HUD or the mortgagee.

Handbook 4000.1  1403  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  3. Taxes. The entire amount for taxes and special assessments which are levied by a 
government body may be included in the assistance calculations. Caution, specified 
assessments may be payable over several tax years. Only the prorated portion due for 
a speci fic tax year may be included.  
NOTE: Do not include ground rents, assessments by mortgagors’ associations, and 
special assessments levied by persons or private organizations.  
B. Additional Disclosures Required Prior To Closing. Prior to closing, mortgagees must 
make mortgagors aware of the following:  
1. the availability of any tax exemption (i.e., available to the mortgagor at the time of 
closing) for which the mortgagor may qualify;  
2. that the responsibility for applying for the exemption is that of the mortgagor;  
3. that their assistance payments will be computed based on the assumption that the 
mortgagor will be receiving the tax exemption for which they qualify;  
C. Adjustment Of “Excessive” Surpluses And Shortages. Where an escrow analysis reveals 
an “excessive” surplus or an “excessive” shortage, a retroactive analysis must be 
performed.  
NOTE: Definition of “Excessive” Surpluses and Shortages. An “excessive” surplus or 
shortage is defined as any amount that is greater or less than requirements by more than 
15 percent of the actual disbursements from the account during the most recent full year. 
Before applying the 15 percent rule, the mortgagee may add one -sixth to the actual 
disbursements if it has chosen to maintain the surplus permitted in Chapter 2 of this 
Handbook.  
D. When Retroactive Adjustments Are Required. Retroactive adjustments must be made at 
the following times:  
1. When The First Analysis Is Performed After Settlement. If a shortage or surplus is 
discovered at this time, the shortage or surplus was probably caused by an incorrect 
amount being collected at settlement to establish the escrow account.  
NOTE: If the cause is due to an improper amount being collected at settlement, HUD 
would not be billed for any portion of the shortage or refunded any portion of the 
surplus.  
2. When The Escrow Analysis Reveals an “excessive” surplus or shortage Allowed (as 
stated in the “NOTE” under Paragraph 10 -20C).  
3. When The Mortgage Is Being Assumed Or Paid In Full. Any necessary adjustment 
revealed by the required escrow analysis must be made prior to completion of either 
of these transactions. However, if this is not possible and/or the mortgagee later 
discovers an  adjustment should have been made for underpaid assistance, make the 
appropriate refund to the mortgagor and bill HUD for the underpayment amount

HUD -93102 and HUD -300. The specific reason for adjustment must be provided in 
Column 3.  
For example, underestimated tax escrow. The beginning and ending effective periods 
of the adjustment (month and year) must be included in the reason for adjustment in 
Column 3 on Form HUD -300. A copy of the escrow analysis clearly depicting the 
cause of es crow shortage and the period must accompany Forms HUD -93102 and 
HUD -300. 
4. When The First Escrow Analysis Of A Suspended Or Terminated Contract Is 
Performed.  
5. When A Prospective Adjustment Would Reduce Assistance To Zero. (A retroactive 
adjustment is required to confirm the proper suspension of the assistance payments 
contract.)  
E. Prospective Adjustments. Except as cited above, the mortgagee may exercise its option to 
make prospective adjustments.  
F. Adjustment Procedure. Regardless of whether the adjustment is to be prospective or 
retroactive, the procedure is the same:  
1. Adjust the “Formula One” Assistance Payment.  
a. Determine the exact amount needed in order to make proper disbursements as 
they become due;  
b. Determine if there were any reported changes (i.e., valid recertifications 
submitted to the mortgagee) in the mortgagor’s household income during the 
period for which escrow is being collected;  
c. Recalculate the “Formula One” assistance payment for any period where the 
income differed;  
2. Verify Accuracy of the “Formula Two” Assistance Payment. If there was an 
anniversary of amortization during the period, the “Formula Two” payment should 
have been adjusted at that time because of the change in MIP . If no adjustment was 
made, the “Formula Two” payment must be recomputed for the period after that 
anniversary.  
NOTE: A common error to look for when verifying Formula Two computations is the 
use of the wrong column in the Section 235 Factor Table Amortization Year - 
Formula Two when determining the anniversary factor. The first column on each 
page of this Factor Ta ble is the factor for the first year (the origination factor) -- not 
the factor for the first recertification.

recertification of a mortgage, the factor shown in the 2nd column would be the 
correct factor to use.  
3. Compare the Two Results. For each period where the mortgagor’s household income 
differed, the smaller of the recomputed “Formula One” assistance payment and the 
correct “Formula Two” assistance payment is the amount that HUD should have been 
billed. Total the correct payments for the entire disbursement period for which money 
was being collected and compare these payment amounts with the amounts actually 
billed. The difference is the overpayment or underpayment of assistance.  
10-21 BILLING FOR ASSISTANCE/HANDLING CHARGES . In order to receive Section 
235 Original, Revised, Revised with Recapture or Revised, Recapture/10 Program assistance 
payments and handling charges, mortgagees must submit billings to HUD on a monthly basis 
using an original and one copy of Form HUD -9310 2, Mortgagee’s Certification and Application 
for Assistance or Interest Reduction Payments. Both the original and the copy of the Form -HUD -
93102 must contain original signatures of an authorized mortgagee offici al. 
NOTE: Only one Form HUD -93102 per mortgage will be accepted for processing each month 
regardless of the mortgagee’s servicing organization or billing procedures. Form HUD -93102 
will be returned unprocessed if it is not accompanied by Form HUD -300 detailing  as required all 
billing amounts included in Blocks 1, 2, 3 or 5 on Form HUD -93102.  
A. Time Frame For Submitting Form HUD -93102. The Form HUD -93102 must be 
submitted to HUD (at the exact address shown on the back of the Form) no earlier than 
the 5th and no later than the 20th of each month in accordance with the instructions 
printed on the b ack of this Form.  
NOTE: Adjustment amounts determined necessary subsequent to submission of a Form 
HUD -93102 for a given month must be included on the next regular month’s billing on 
the Form HUD -93102 line(s) provided for billing adjustment amounts. Duplicate Forms 
HUD -93102 submitted in the same month will be returned to the mortgagee unprocessed.  
B. Submission/Completion Of HUD -93102.  
1. A Single Form HUD -93102 For The Total of All Section 235 Program Assistance 
Payment Requests. One billing must be submitted on Form HUD -93102 which 
includes billing amounts for all Section 235 assistance payments due for either the 
Original program in Block 1, the Revised program in Block 2, the Revised with 
Recapture program in Block 3, or the Revised Recapture/10 program in Block 5. The 
billing must be submitted with an original and one copy of Form HUD -93102. Both 
the original and the copy must contain original signatures of an authorized mortgagee 
official. F ailure to submit the original and a copy will cause payment processing 
delays.

2. Adjustments To The Regular Monthly Billing Amounts. The adjustment Line 2 in 
each Block 1, 2, 3 or 5 on Form HUD -93102 must be used to request retroactive 
payment of assistance for prior months.  
Line 1 in Blocks 1, 2, 3 or 5 should include the total amount of assistance for the 
current billing period only.  
Any billing amounts included on an adjustment Line 2 on Form HUD -93102 must be

Reduction Payments Due Under Section 236, must accompany the completed Form 
HUD -93102.  
1. Mortgagees using facsimile versions of Form HUD -300 must include on the modified 
version, all data required on the actual Form HUD -300. 
2. Any transaction Code 1, current month’s regular billing amount which is more or less 
than the amount billed in the prior month must be supported by appropriate 
documentation as follows:  
Reason for Change  Documentation Required  
Case reinstated  Form HUD -93114  and unless suspended in 
error, Forms HUD -93101 -A and HUD -93101  
Income increase or decrease  Form HUD -93101 -A 
Monthly mortgage payment amount 
changed due to escrow shortage or surplus  A copy of the escrow analysis clearly depicting 
what caused the required decrease or increase in 
escrow (e.g., taxes underestimated by $20 per 
month)  
 
D. Review For Billing Accuracy. HUD will review billings for propriety, legality and 
correctness. When a billing is received that is not signed by an authorized mortgagee 
official, not accompanied by a Form HUD -300, and/or requests amounts which cannot be 
reconciled to FHA/HUD case detail provided on Form HUD -300, it will be returned to

corrected billing for that month.  
When the amount billed for a case is more or less than the amount billed in the prior 
month, no payment will be made for the case unless the billing is accompanied by the 
required Form HUD -93101 -A, escrow analysis, or HUD mortgage recapture approval 
letter , whichever is applicable.  
When a mortgagee determines than an income increase is not retroactive, as reflected by 
the “effective date of payment change” entered in Block C (7) on Form HUD -93101 -A 
(i.e., the mortgagor’s income increase was not received prior to the date that the 
mortgagee received the mortgagor’s recertification), a copy of HUD -93101 must be 
attached to the Form HUD -93101 -A for accounting office verification of the overpaid 
subsidy determination.  
When the effective date of payment change reflects that an income decrease is 
retroactive, Form HUD -93101 must be attached to Form HUD -93101 -A for verification 
of the underpayment determination (also see Paragraph 10 -31). 
No payment will be made on cases when non -retroactive subsidy decrease, or retroactive 
subsidy increase amounts as described above are not documented for verification by 
attachment of both Forms HUD -93101 -A and HUD -93101 to the billing Form HUD -
93102.  
Subsidy increases due to escrow shortage will not be paid for any case unless:  
1. the billing is accompanied by an escrow analysis; and  
2. for each escrow item disbursed which was included in the subsidy amount 
calculation, copies of the canceled checks and invoices for accounting office 
verification of the shortage computation are attached.  
E. Mortgagee Liability (24  CFR 235. 361(b)). Mortgagees are responsible for the accuracy 
of the billings and shall be held liable for fraud or false certification made on these 
billings (see Paragraph 10 -28B). All billings must be signed by an authorized mortgagee 
official. Improper  billings may result in the imposition of substantial financial penalties 
as the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act applies to assistance payments.  
NOTE: Mortgagee signing officials should give special attention to the meaning of the 
certification signed by authorized mortgagee officials on Form HUD -93102. The signing 
official is certifying, subject to the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, that:  
1. the assistance payment amount requested for each case included in the bill has been 
correctly calculated both for the amounts and the periods claimed due in accordance 
with the provisions of this Handbook;  
2. the bill does not include any amounts on behalf of mortgagors who have not complied 
with recertification requirements within the time limits specified in this  Handbook, or 
in the manner set forth in 24 CFR 235. 350;

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  3. the bill does not include amounts on behalf of mortgagors not eligible for assistance 
in accordance with provisions set forth in 24  CFR 235 and as set forth in this 
Handbook;  
4. no amount in the billing has been previously claimed in an outstanding bill, 
determined by HUD as not payable in a previous bill (i.e., determined not payable 
after a HUD review of required billing support documents) or paid in a previous bill;  
5. supporting details, records and worksheets, together with a copy of the applicable 
billing are being held in the mortgagee’s file; and  
6. all aforementioned documents will be furnished or made available upon request of an 
authorized official of HUD or of the Comptroller General of the United States. A 
determination made upon review that certification to the above was false may result 
in the imposition of substantial financial penalties.  
F. Receipt Of HUD’s Payment. When a billing is submitted to HUD in accordance with 
outstanding instructions and within the time frame shown in Paragraph 10 -21, payment 
should reach the mortgagee on or about the first day of the following month.  
G. Monthly Billing. HUD will process payment for only one monthly billing form. 
Duplicate requests will be returned to the mortgagee unprocessed.  
1. Monthly billings must be submitted on the current Form HUD -93102, dated March 
1988 which may be obtained from the Government Printing Office. Obsolete Forms 
HUD -93102 will be returned unprocessed.  
2. Recertifications of income which accompany the billing must be submitted on the 
current Form 93101 -A, dated March 1990  
3. Monthly billings should include:  
a. the assistance amount due for the current billing period on Line 1 of the 
appropriate Block 1, 2, 3 or 5; plus  
b. the assistance amount for any prior months the mortgagor was entitled to 
assistance but for which the assistance amount was not paid on a previously 
submitted Form HUD -93102 or included on an outstanding Form HUD -93102 on 
Line 2 of the appropriate Block 1, 2, 3 or 5; minus  
c. adjustments for overpaid amounts due HUD which is also on Line 2 of the 
appropriate Block 1, 2, 3 or 5;  
d. the net total of Line 1 and Line 2 on Line 3 of the appropriate Blocks 1, 2, 3 or 5; 
and 
e. the summary total from Line 3 of Blocks 1, 2 and 3 in Block 4.  
NOTE: Overpaid subsidy identified in response to HUD conducted mortgagee 
reviews requiring retroactive assistance payments reviews to be performed by 
mortgagees should not be included on the regular monthly billing. The required 
review must be completed wi thin the time frame specified by HUD’s (or its 
agent’s) mortgagee review report. Overpayment must be submitted on a separate

Review Billing”.  
This billing must be accompanied by:  
(1) a check made payable to HUD for the total overpayment amount; and  
(2) a mortgagee review findings report which lists in columns, the following 
information:  
(a) the name of each overpaid mortgagor:  
(b) the FHA case number;  
(c) the month and year of the beginning and ending period of overpaid 
subsidy (i.e., 3/86 -5/88);  
(d) the overpayment amount;  
(e) an explanation of:  
i. the cause of overpayment (using explanations of adjustment codes 
from Paragraph 10 -21); 
ii. the date of the event which resulted in the overpayment; and  
iii. the effective period of the adjustment.  
(f) the mortgagee’s calculation of the overpayment amount; and  
(g) attachments Forms HUD -93101 -A, HUD -93101, HUD -93114 (one HUD -
93114 to suspend the assistance payments and one to reinstate the 
assistance payments for retroactive suspensions resulting in 
overpayments) and/or escrow analyses as applicable to the explanation 
given for overpayment.  
Copies of the check and Forms HUD -93102 and HUD -300 must also be 
sent to the appropriate HUD local Office that conducted the review.  
H. Rounding Off Billing Amounts. At the option of the mortgagee, assistance may be billed 
in either of the following ways:  
1. using the exact amount to which the mortgagor is entitled; or  
2. using the amount arrived at after rounding off the exact amount to the nearest dollar 
(i.e., $. 01 -$. 49 round down to zero; $0. 50 -$. 99 round up to $1. 00).  
Regardless of which method is used when billing HUD, mortgagees must be 
consistent and must use the same method (i.e., rounding off or using the exact 
amount) must be used for all amounts billed and used when crediting the individual 
mortgagor’s account.  
I. Billing Of Handling Charges. The mortgagee is entitled to a $3. 00 handling fee per 
month, per active Section 235 mortgage account.

Handbook 4000.1  1411  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  10-22 ASSUMPTIONS. Assistance may be continued on behalf of an assumptor if that 
assumptor meets all qualifying requirements as of the day the mortgage assumption actually 
takes place (i.e., the day the mortgage is executed by the assumptor at closing).  
A. Assistance Eligibility. The information on Form HUD -93100 -4 must reflect that, on the 
day of closing, the assumptor’s status qualified him/her for assistance based on the 
eligibility criteria for new mortgagors.  
NOTE: The assumptor’s household is not required (as the original mortgagor was) to 
have five or more members if the property has four or more bedrooms.  
B. Additional Underwriting Requirements For Section 235 Assumptions . Assumptions of 
Section 235 mortgages are treated the same as those insured under any other section of 
the Act except for the following additional underwriting requirements:  
1. where subsidy eligibility must be determined, the assistance application (Form HUD 
93100 -4) is to be reviewed before the credit application and, if assistance is to be 
authorized, the amount of assistance is to be used as income in the credit evaluation; 
and 
2. if the firm commitment to insure the original mortgage or direct endorsement 
underwriter’s credit approval was issued on or after May  27, 1981, the assumptor 
must sign, at closing, a note agreeing to pay any recapture of assistance that may be 
due HUD in order to satisfy this lien on the property (24  CFR 235.12). (See Chapter 
11). 
C. Mortgagee Responsibility. In addition to enforcing the [HUD’s creditworthiness 
requirements], when the mortgagee becomes aware there has been or will be an 
assumption, the following action must be taken:  
1. make the assumptor aware that he/she may be eligible for assistance;  
2. prepare the necessary documents to determine eligibility for assistance (if assumptor 
wishes to be considered for assistance);  
3. where the assumptor appears to be eligible for assistance, processing must be delayed 
until the local HUD Office has determined whether assistance can be approved in 
order that any assistance may be considered in the credit analysis;  
4. make the assumptor aware of his/her recapture responsibilities (as listed below) if the 
firm commitment (or direct endorsement credit approval) was issued on or after 
May 27, 1981:  
a. there is an existing lien against the property in favor of HUD which shall remain 
there until satisfied;  
b. the recapture will become due immediately due if he/she does not:  
(1) qualify for assistance;  
(2) agree to accept the assistance for which he/she qualifies;  
(3) agree to execute a new note at closing;

Handbook 4000.1  1412  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  c. the recapture becomes due once the assumptor acquires title  to the property. 
He/she will be held liable for the full amount required to satisfy HUD’s lien on 
the property;  
5. where appropriate, take the necessary action to obtain and prepare the required 
documentation and collect the amount due HUD to satisfy the recapture lien in 
accordance with Chapter 11; and  
6. suspend the assistance payments contract if the mortgage is assumed before HUD 
approves the assumptor for assistance.  
D. HUD Responsibility. In addition to enforcing [HUD’s creditworthiness requirements], 
when HUD becomes aware that there has been or will be an assumption, it will:  
1. determine the assumptor’s eligibility for assistance;  
2. if eligible, determine the initial amount of assistance for which the assumptor 
qualifies;  
3. where appropriate, determine whether the assumptor’s credit qualifies (if the case is 
not being processed by a direct endorsement mortgagee);  
4. where appropriate, take the necessary action to:  
a. obtain and prepare the required documentation to determine the recapture amount 
due in order to satisfy the Section 235 lien;  
b. collect and deposit the amount due HUD;  
c. prepare the satisfaction of the recapture lien in accordance with instructions 
provided in Chapter 11;  
d. obtain the signatures of an authorized HUD official and get the satisfaction 
notarized; and  
e. forward the executed and notarized satisfaction to the mortgagee in accordance 
with instructions outlined in Chapter 11.  
E. Cut-off/Start -up Dates For Assistance. Assistance should be cut off and started as 
follows:  
1. When assumptors are approved before acquiring title : 
a. subsidy will cease on behalf of the seller effective the first day of the month after 
he/she moves out of the property;  
b. subsidy will begin on behalf of the approved assumptor effective the first day of 
the following month (i.e., the month after the seller moved out) PROVIDED the 
assumptor has moved into the property and has acquired title  to the property by 
the effective date.  
NOTE: For this purpose, the acquisition date may be considered as the date the 
deed was recorded unless the mortgagor can demonstrate an earlier date.  
c. if the assumptor does not acquire title  and occupy the property within 90 calendar 
days after the seller moves out, the assistance payments must be suspended.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  NOTE: Suspension will continue until the first day of the month after the 
assumptor has moved into the property and has acquired title  to the property.  
2. When assumptors are approved after acquisition of title : 
a. subsidy will cease on behalf of the seller effective with the first day of the month 
after occupancy ends;  
b. subsidy will begin on behalf of the assumptor effective (depending on the length 
of delay between the assumption and application for assistance) as follows:  
(1) Delay of 90 Days or Less. If no more than 90 days elapse between title  
acquisition and application for assistance, payments shall be made retroactive 
to the first day of the month following title acquisition or occupancy of the 
property, whichever is later.  
(2) Delays of More Than 90 Days. If more than 90 days elapse between title  
acquisition and application for assistance, payments shall be made effective 
from the first day of the month following application, PROVIDED the 
assumptor has title and occupies the property when the application is 
submitted and through the time that the application for assistance is approved.  
10-23 DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS.  Mortgagees are expected to treat Section 235 
mortgages in the same manner as other insured mortgages when they become delinquent. The 
mortgagor remains eligible for assistance until the mortgagee takes the first legal action required 
to initiate foreclosu re or until some other event requires suspension or termination of the 
assistance payments contract.  
A. Partial Payments. Assistance payments for periods when the mortgagor fails to make 
his/her share of the mortgage payment are not to be considered partial payments of the 
mortgagor’s share of the full monthly mortgage amount. HUD assistance payments must 
be accepted regardless of the amount or the length of the delinquency. Before foreclosure  
may be started, all partial payments of the mortgagor’s share must be applied toward the 
unpaid monthly installments, beginning with the earliest unpaid installment.  
1. All assistance payments earned up to the time of the action to foreclose the mortgage 
must be billed for and applied to complete the monthly installments in the order in 
which they become due, e.g., to MIP , escrow, interest, and principal, beginning with 
the earliest unpaid installment. All unearned assistance payments should be applied as 
a reduction towards the amount billed HUD monthly on Form HUD -93102.  
2. Reinstatement of the account by the mortgagor may not be delayed pending receipt of 
earned but unpaid assistance payments, and those payments must be billed for 
promptly when the mortgagee decides to accept reinstatement from the mortgagor.  
NOTE: The rules governing return of partial payments in Paragraph 7 -9 apply only to 
the mortgagor’s share of the payment, not to the portion that is paid by HUD.

Handbook 4000.1  1414  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  B. Forbearance. Assistance payments are not affected by forbearance agreements. They are 
treated as partial payments as described in the preceding paragraph. During these periods, 
however, the mortgagor must maintain eligibility for assistance (i.e., by continuing to 
occupy the property, providing required recertifications, etc. ) and the mort gagee must 
continue to make adjustments to the amount of assistance for which the mortgagor is 
entitled as though the mortgagor were making his/her portion of the monthly payments as 
required.  
C. Special Forbearance. Assistance payments are not affected by special forbearance 
agreements. The special forbearance agreement:  
1. shall be prepared in accordance with instructions outlined in Paragraph 8 -4; and  
2. shall include an additional provision recognizing that the assistance payments will 
continue to be adjusted as required under the Section 235 program;  
D. Recasting. When a Section 235 mortgage is recast, the monthly payment due under the 
mortgage as recast becomes the base for calculating both “Formula One” and “Formula 
Two” assistance payments. The new principal amount after recasting is considered the 
original mortgage amount for amortization purposes and the new maturity date governs.  
NOTE: MIP  is not affected by recasting. Regardless of the new unpaid principal balance, 
the MIP continues to be calculated on the original scheduled unpaid balances.  
10-24 ASSIGNMENT TO HUD . Assistance payments are not affected by an assignment of the 
mortgage to HUD. The assistance payment contract shall remain in effect up to the date the 
assignment is filed for record.  
NOTE: The last assistance payments for which the mortgage should bill HUD are those for the 
month immediately preceding the month in which the mortgage is assigned.  
10-25 PREPAYMENTS.  Section 235 prepayments shall be as follows:  
A. Partial. If partial prepayments have been applied to reduce future monthly payments (see 
Paragraph 5 -3A2), both “Formula One” and “Formula Two” must be recalculated based 
on the revised payments.  
B. In Full. The last assistance payment payable will be for the month the mortgage was paid 
in full presuming the mortgagor was in occupancy and was the legal owner on the first 
day of the month.  
10-26 TRANSFER OF SERVICING.  A transfer of servicing has the following affect on a 
Section 235 mortgage:  
A. Assistance Eligibility. A mortgagor’s eligibility for assistance will not be affected;  
B. Recertifications. Annual recertification may be affected if:

Handbook 4000.1  1415  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  1. the mortgagees involved in the transfer use different anniversary dates for 
recertification; and  
2. the transfer would result in a lapse of more than 15 months between recertifications.  
C. Additional Recertification  Required. Where the situation described in Paragraph 10 -26B 
occurs, the new mortgagee or servicer must require recertification twice in the first year 
after acquisition —one on the anniversary date used previously by the former mortgagee 
or servicer and th e second one on the anniversary date that is being used by the new 
mortgagee or servicer.  
D. Additional Notice To Mortgagor. Within 10 days of the transfer, the new mortgagee or 
servicer must:  
1. advise the mortgagor of the transfer of the mortgage; and  
2. provide the mortgagor with the new recertification schedule.  
NOTE: The above disclosures may be included with the notice of servicing transfer 
required by Paragraph 6 -11B or sent as a separate notice. However, if the above 
disclosure is sent as a part of the normal notice required by Paragraph 6 -11B when a 
mortgage is transfe rred, the notice must be received by the mortgagor at least 10 days 
before the due date of the first payment to the new mortgagee or servicer.  
E. Seller’s/Purchaser’s Servicing Responsibility. When an insured mortgage is sold, the 
purchasing mortgagee succeeds to all rights and becomes bound by all of the obligations 
of the selling mortgagee under the contract of mortgage insurance. Purchasing 
mortg agees should be aware that they will be held fully responsible to HUD financially 
for errors or omissions on the part of the selling mortgagee (or its agents), discovered 
after the transfer is reported, even though those errors or omissions may have taken place 
before it was reported to HUD.  
10-27 POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF LAW OR REGULATIONS.  Mortgagees are not 
expected to seek out evidence of wrongdoing on the part of mortgagors. Neither are they 
expected to extensively investigate allegations of wrongdoing brought to their attention. 
However, if a matter can be reasonably explained and/or re solved without extensive 
investigation, those facts should be used in computing assistance.  
A. Mortgagee Responsibility.  
1. General. The mortgagee’s actions taken independently of instructions from HUD 
must always be exercised with due care, using the best information available 
including recent information reflected in the mortgagor’s recertification, with its 
supporting verify ing data.  
2. Report Clues/Evidence of Mortgagor’s Possible Wrongdoing. Possible clues and/or 
evidence of possible wrongdoing on the part of the mortgagor are to be forwarded to 
the local HUD Office for whatever action it deems appropriate. Until notified by the 
local H UD Office as to the action that will be taken (if any), the mortgagee should

10-27A1. Such clues and/or evidence may include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
a. a verification of income showing a date of employment or an increase in income 
much earlier than the date(s) certified to by the mortgagor which cannot be 
reconciled;  
b. an application for another type of loan which shows a new spouse with income 
and/or other additional sources of income not shown in the recertification;  
c. a disclosure, during negotiation of a repayment plan to cure a default, that the 
mortgagor or other family members have income not reported in the 
recertification;  
d. a name change of the person or a different person signs the recertification for 
which no reason is known;  
e. the receipt of allegations from either identified or anonymous sources containing 
enough specific information that would lead a person to believe that the 
recertification might contain false information; and  
3. Information Not to be Reported. The mortgagee is charged with acting on its own 
initiative, basing its actions on the best information available (as outlined in 
Paragraph 10 -27A1), and for documenting its files as to why a particular action was 
taken.  
The following are the examples of cases where the mortgagee shall take appropriate 
action including completion of all required retroactive recertifications and therefore, 
need not refer the case to HUD include, but not limited to, the following:  
a. where the mortgage was insured before January  5, 1976, and the mortgagor did 
not report an increase in income caused by a change in the source of income of 
any adult family member until the first normal recertification following the 
increase; and  
NOTE: Reason for Not Reporting to HUD —A $50 increase (or more) per month 
on these mortgages does not require an additional recertification. The assistance 
payments are adjusted at the time of the annual recertification effective as of the 
date the income i ncrease occurred.  
b. where the mortgage was insured on or after January  5, 1976, and the mortgagor 
failed to notify the mortgagee of changes in total family income as noted in (a) 
above or the mortgagor did not report a $50 increase (or more) per month in adult 
family income until the annual recertification and overpaid assistanc e resulted.  
NOTE: Reason for Not Reporting to HUD —While the mortgagor is obligated to 
report a $50 increase (or more) per month in adult family income when they are 
received, it was reported at the time of the annual recertification. Once the 
mortgagee learns that suc h an increase did go into effect and went unreported by 
the mortgagor, the mortgagee is to take the necessary steps to determine when the

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  $50 (or more) income increased per month. Assistance must then be recomputed 
and the overpaid assistance refunded to HUD.  
B. HUD Field Office Responsibility. The HUD Field Office Manager will review any 
information sent in with respect to possible wrongdoing on the part of a mortgagor and 
will determine whether further investigation is warranted.  
1. Where An Investigation Is Warranted. Where it is warranted, the Field Office 
Manager will take the necessary steps to refer a case to the appropriate HUD office 
for investigation.  
2. Where An Investigation Is Not Warranted. Where administrative action is appropriate 
and former investigation is not warranted, the Field Office Manager will notify the 
mortgagee, in writing, of its decision. Written instructions will also be provided to th e 
mortgagee as to how it should proceed with the adjustment of the assistance 
payments.  
C. Office Of The HUD Inspector General. The actual conduct of investigations into possible 
fraud or referral of information to other agencies for further investigation and decisions 
relating to prosecution is the responsibility of the Inspector General. Mortg agees will not 
normally be advised of the progress of investigations and should make no assumptions  as 
to their possible outcome and its impact on assistance payments.  
10-28 CAUSES OF OVERPAID ASSISTANCE.  Overpaid assistance exists anytime assistance 
is billed and paid for any amounts greater than those for which a mortgagee/mortgagor is 
entitled. Listed below are the most common situations which result in overpaid assistance:  
A. Mortgagee’s Failure To Meet Contractual Obligations. This occurs when the mortgagee 
fails to meet its obligations under the assistance payments contract as follows:  
1. requesting a handling charge on cases when recertifications have not been requested 
timely;  
2. failing to act in a timely manner when:  
a. requesting a required recertification at the proper time;  
b. recalculating assistance payments;  
c. submitting Form HUD -93101 -A and HUD -93114, as applicable;  
d. adjusting subsidy payments when a recertification Form HUD -93101 is received 
containing information which requires suspension or adjustment of assistance 
payments billed;  
e. retroactively calculating adjustments in assistance payments from the date of 
income increases and crediting overpaid assistance amounts to HUD when annual 
or interim recertifications reflect income increases;

mortgagors failure to timely respond to certification requests; and/or  
h. verifying recertified income in the manner set forth in Paragraph 10 -10. 
B. Mortgagee Fraud Or Misrepresentation. This occurs when:  
1. mortgagees falsify certifications on monthly billing Form HUD -93102 submitted to 
HUD for assistance payments (see Paragraph 10 -21E); or  
2. any other fraud and/or misrepresentation in the Section 235 program.  
C. Mortgagor Errors Or Omissions. The most common mortgagor errors are failures (for 
whatever reason) to:  
1. report increases of adult family income of $50 or more per month when the mortgage 
was insured on or after January  5, 1976;  
2. advise the mortgagee when the property is sold;  
3. advise the mortgagee when he/she no longer meet occupancy or some other basic 
eligibility requirement; and/or  
4. include an income source on a required recertification.  
D. Mortgagor Fraud Or Misrepresentation. When a mortgagor fails to include income 
amounts or sources, and/or misrepresents occupancy or other eligibility data, on a 
recertification in an attempt to receive assistance for which he/she is not eligible.  
10-29 REPAYMENT OF OVERPAID ASSISTANCE (24  CFR 235.361) .  
A. Overpayments Caused By The Mortgagee. The mortgagee must refund to HUD all 
overpaid assistance and all handling charges for each month during which there was an 
overpayment, plus interest computed at the rate of seven percent per annum on the entire 
amount  from the date of the first overpayment when an overpayment results from the 
following circumstances:  
1. fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the mortgagee; and/or  
2. the mortgagee’s failure to meet a contractual obligation, as described in Paragraph 
10-28. 
The total overpayment amount must be credited on the next month’s billing on Form 
HUD -93102 and should include return of handling charges paid for each period of 
overpayment for each case. Form HUD -300, Column 3, must reflect an explanation 
of the overpaym ent cause and the affected beginning and ending period (month and 
year).  
The 7% interest amount must be sent in a separate check made payable to HUD with 
an itemized listing of the 7% calculation and total interest due for each overpaid case. 
The check with the itemized listing should accompany the Form HUD -93102 billing.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  B. Overpayment Caused By Error. When an overpayment is caused by an error on the part 
of the mortgagee or the mortgagor only the overpaid assistance need be refunded. The 
mortgagee shall refund the overpaid assistance by:  
1. reimbursing HUD the total overpaid amount on the next month’s billing (on Form 
HUD -93102); and  
2. collecting the overpaid assistance from the mortgagor in a lump sum or in 
installments while exercising due caution not to cause a default by the manner of 
collection selected (24  CFR 235.361(c)).  
3. Only as a last resort should the mortgagee apply a mortgage payment or payments to 
the recovery of the overpaid amount.  
NOTE: If the error which created the overpaid assistance was caused by the 
mortgagee then the mortgagee must repay HUD, however, HUD does not require the 
mortgagee to collect repayment from the mortgagor.  
C. Mortgagor No Longer Obligated Under The Mortgage.  
1. On cases where the mortgagor is no longer obligated under the mortgage, the 
mortgagee must send the mortgagor’s last known address to the HUD Office having 
jurisdiction over the mortgage.  
2. The Claims Collection Officer in the HUD Field Office is responsible for the 
collection activities.  
10-30 CAUSES OF UNDERPAYMENTS . Listed below are circumstances which may result in 
underpayments and are the only causes for which a mortgagee may bill for underpaid assistance:  
A. math errors;  
B. using a wrong factor in calculating the “Formula Two” assistance payment;  
C. underestimating escrow requirements; and/or  
D. the mortgagee’s failure to initiate an optional recertification after notification from a 
mortgagor of a reduction of income.  
NOTE: Failure of a mortgagor to request an optional recertification at the time of a 
reduction in the income of an adult family member is not a justification to bill for an 
underpayment at a later date.  
10-31 COLLECTING UNDERPAID ASSISTANCE.  The total underpayment amount may be 
added to the next month’s billing (on Form HUD -93102). Retroactive billings for underpaid 
subsidy must be accompanied by Forms HUD -93101 -A and 93101, Form HUD -93114 
requesting reinstatement of a suspension in error, or  an escrow analysis with support documents 
as defined in Paragraph 10 -21D.

accompany Form HUD -93102, or the explanation of adjustment is not provided on Form HUD -
300 with documentation required as defined in Paragraph 10 -21B3.  
10-32 RECORDS MAINTENANCE (24  CFR 235.365 and 235.830).  HUD Field Offices will 
periodically review mortgagee records to establish that assistance is being billed properly. These 
reviews will normally cover recertifications, verifications, billings, suspensions, terminations, 
documentation, and escrow analysis.  In addition to the records maintenance required on other 
types of mortgages, mortgagees must have complete records to support the amounts billed each 
month on each mortgage from the time of originatio n through termination of assistance payments 
(also see Paragraph 10 -17), including recapture of assistance where applicable (see Chapter 11). 
These records must be adequate to support every dollar of assistance billed. Where records do 
not exist to substan tiate the amount of assistance billed, assistance will be considered overpaid 
and must be refunded unless the mortgagee can reconstruct adequate records to support the 
payments. For each case, the records must include:  
A. all initial applications (Forms HUD -93100 -4) and required recertifications (Form HUD -
93101 and 93101 -A), with supporting verifications and other related documentation;  
B. all optional recertifications that resulted in changes in assistance, with supporting 
verifications and other related documentation;  
C. for each suspension, reinstatement, or termination:  
1. a Form HUD -93114;  
2. all individual escrow analyses related to overpaid or underpaid assistance; and  
3. individual ledgers (or other records) showing application of assistance to the account;  
D. all monthly billings (Forms HUD -93102) for assistance payments with supporting 
documentation for all adjustments for overpaid or underpaid assistance;  
E. for each monthly billing (Form HUD -93102), a case -by-case summary showing, for each 
case included in the billing, the following data elements:  
1. the date of endorsement for insurance;  
2. the original mortgage amount;  
3. the certified adjusted annual income used that month;  
4. the total mortgage payment that month;

9. the beginning and ending effective dates (month and year) of adjustment transactions 
Code 2;  
10. the handling charge; and  
11. the total bill.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  10-33 RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRANSFERRING RECORDS.  Mortgagees acquiring 
mortgages from other mortgagees and/or changing servicers are fully responsible for records that 
should have been maintained by the selling/transferring mortgagee or servicer.  
NOTE: If it is determined after a change of servicers that assistance has been overpaid, the 
servicer at the time of the discovery will be responsible for refunding the overpayment.  
10-34 REPORTING TO HUD.  For monitoring purposes, the following Section 235 reports are 
to be submitted to HUD Headquarters.  
NOTE: These reports should not be submitted to Field Offices unless specifically requested.  
A. Reports On Recertifications. A Form HUD -93101 -A must be submitted on each case 
recertified. The appropriate address is printed on the form.  
B. Ad Hoc Reporting. As needed, HUD will request information on the cumulative 
assistance paid on an account to date (i.e., from origination through termination of the 
assistance contract) to determine the amount of recapture due HUD in order to satisfy the 
recapture lien. Records must be maintained in such a manner as to enable the mortgagee 
to provide this information. Such information must be made available to HUD upon 
request.  
10-35 INFORMATION TO MORTGAGORS (24  CFR 203.508(c) and 235.1001) . Within 30 
days after the end of each calendar year, the mortgagee must provide the mortgagor with a 
statement advising the following:  
A. the total amount of assistance applied to the mortgagor’s account during the preceding 
year;  
B. the taxes and interest paid on the mortgagor’s behalf during the year; and  
C. a notice as to the probable deductibility of interest payments using substantially the 
language shown below:  
“If you itemize deductions on your income tax return s, please read this notice. Under Section 1. 
163-1(d) of Federal Income Tax Regulations, you, as the mortgagor, may deduct for Federal 
income tax purposes, only that part, if any, of mortgage interest payments made during the year 
which exceeded the amount  of assistance payments made by HUD during the year. You are 
urged to contact your tax advisor or State and local tax offices for guidance regarding the 
deductibility of payments on your State or local income tax returns.”  
10-36 REVISED/RECAPTURE/10 PROGRAM (24  CFR 235.12) . The Appropriations Act of 
1984 reactivated the Section 235 Program as revised by the Housing and Urban Rural Recovery 
Act of 1983. Mortgages insured under Section 235 beginning in early 1985 are identified with 
case number suffixes (the last three number s) 246, 346, and 546. The assistance payments 
contract on these mortgages is limited by the Housing and Urban Rural Recovery Act of 1983 to 
10 years after mortgage origination. When the 10 year period ends, the mortgagee must terminate

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  the assistance payment contract, if there is not a request by the Department to continue such 
assistance. The assistance paid during the contract period is subject to recapture by HUD under 
certain circumstances. Procedures and requirements of these mortga ges are the same as for other 
Section 235 mortgage except as indicated below:  
A. Documentation At Origination. Assistance payments on these mortgages are disbursed 
and monitored using an automated system. In order to set up a new case in the automated 
system, the HUD Field Office must have:  
1. the completed Mortgage Insurance Certificate indicating the FHA/HUD case number;  
2. the separate assistance payments contract which has been executed by both HUD and 
the mortgagee and the “Acknowledgement of Mortgagors”, signed by the mortgagors;  
3. the mortgage interest rate;  
4. the due date of the first principal and interest  payment;  
5. the mortgagee and/or servicer’s complete name, address and mortgagee number 
assigned by HUD;  
B. “Formula One” Assistance. Under this program, the “Formula One” assistance payment 
is the difference between the full monthly mortgage payment and 28 percent of the 
mortgagor’s adjusted monthly family income (as opposed to 20 percent under earlier 
versions of the program). The actual assistance paid is still the lesser  of the “Formula 
One” and “Formula Two” payments.  
C. Recapture Of Assistance (24  CFR 235.12). In addition to the limited term of assistance, 
these mortgages are distinguished by a provision for recapture of assistance when the 
property is sold. (See Chapter 11 for detailed recapture procedures.)  
D. Mortgage Assumptions . Mortgages insured under this program are assumable under the 
same conditions as are any other insured mortgages. However, mortgagors will not be 
eligible for assistance after the tenth anniversary of the first payment due under the 
original mortgage. Ass umptors and potential assumptors should be advised of these 
limitations and how these limitations shall affect them.  
NOTE: Allowable fees for assumptions  of Section 235 mortgages are found in Chapter 4, 
Paragraph 4 -4A3.  
10-37 ALIEN MORTGAGORS.  To be eligible for assistance, a mortgagor must be a citizen of 
the United States or an alien admitted for permanent residence.  
A. Citizenship /Permanent Alien Status Proof Required. Evidence of this eligibility must be 
submitted to the mortgagee whenever:  
1. there is a new application for assistance;  
2. an existing cooperative membership is purchased;  
3. an assisted mortgage is assumed;  
4. an assisted mortgage is assigned to HUD; or  
5. an assisted mortgage that has been in default is reinstated under 24  CFR 203.608.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  B. Forms Of Acceptable Proof. When any of the events in the preceding paragraph occur, 
the mortgagee must ask the mortgagor to provide proof of eligibility based on citizenship . 
Acceptable proof may include:  
1. a Birth Certificate;  
2. a United States Passport  
3. an Alien Registration Card (i.e., “Green Card”); or  
4. a Naturalization Certificate.  
C. Mortgagee Certification. The mortgagee must then certify that acceptable proof as stated 
in the preceding paragraph has been submitted by all persons from whom it is required. 
NOTE: If the mortgagee cannot make this certification, the assistance payments contract 
must be suspended and the mortgagor notif ied of the consequences.  
D. Fraudulent Or Invalid Documentation (24  CFR 235.361(b)). If the documentation should 
prove to be fraudulent, invalid or inadequate, the mortgagor will be required to repay all 
assistance payments to HUD. In addition, the mortgagee may be required to refund 
overpaid assistance payments, plus hand ling charges and interest.  
E. When Assistance May Be Reinstated. Assistance payments may be resumed at HUD’s 
discretion if all aliens not able to establish eligibility have moved from the property or 
have established eligibility.  
ii. Recapture of Section 235 Assistance Payments  
Formerly HUD Handbook 4330.1, REV -5, Chapter 11  
11-1 GENERAL.  The Housing and Community Development Acts of 1980 and 1981 changed 
Section 235 of the National Housing Act to allow the Secretary of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) to require recapture of all, or a portion of, the assistance 
paymen ts made on behalf of mortgagors under Section 235(i) who obtain FHA -insured 
mortgages.  
11-2 MORTGAGES AFFECTED BY RECAPTURE PROVISION (24  CFR 235.12(a)). 
Section 235 mortgages are subject to a recapture where a firm commitment (or, under the Direct 
Endorsement Program, where the underwriter’s approval of the Mortgage Credit Analysis 
Worksheet) was dated on or after May  27, 1981.  
A. If the Firm Commitment date is on or before May  26, 1981, the first mortgage is not 
under the Section 235 Recapture Program, even though the settlement date occurred after 
May 26, 1981. The suffix of the FHA case number of mortgages insured under the first 
and second Section 235 Assistance Program allocations ends in the number five (5).  
B. If the Firm Commitment date is on or after May  27, 1981, the first mortgage is under the 
Section 235 Recapture Program, even though the suffix of the FHA case number may end 
in the number five (5). The suffix for mortgages insured under the Section 235 Recapture 
Program ends in the numbers fifty -six (56) a nd sixty -six (66).

mortgages insured under the Section 235 Revised/Recapture/10 Program ends in the 
number forty -six (46). (Refer to paragraph 10 -36). 
11-3 METHOD OF SECURING REPAYMENT (24  CFR 235.12(d)).  The mortgagor is 
required to execute, at the time of closing of the first mortgage, a second note and mortgage or 
deed of trust (referred to as the security instrument or the HUD lien), with addendum, in favor of 
the Secretary to secure repayment of the a ssistance. The property is pledged as security for the 
second mortgage (i.e., the recapture lien).  
11-4 MORTGAGEE’S RESPONSIBILITY PRIOR TO INSURANCE ENDORSEMENT.  
Upon making application with the mortgagee for assistance under the Section 235 program, the 
mortgagee shall make the mortgagor aware of the recapture provision by providing a copy of the 
“Notice To Buyer”  
A. Contents Of “Notice To Buyer”. This notice describes:  
1. the provisions of the law which requires the repayment of all, or a portion of, the 
assistance payments which are paid on the mortgagor’s behalf (and any subsequent 
assumptor of the mortgage) prior to the release of the second mortgage on the 
property;  
2. the events which will “trigger” the recapture;  
3. the formula used by HUD to determine the amount of recapture due to satisfy the 
second mortgage;  
4. the importance of retaining all paid receipts and/or  
5. bills relating to improvements made to a property; and  
6. the financial responsibility that is acquired by an assumptor if the mortgage is 
assumed.  
B. Mortgagor’s Written Acknowledgement Required. At closing, the mortgagor must 
acknowledge that he/she has been made aware of the recapture provision by signing and 
dating an original and two copies of the “Notice To Buyer”.  
C. Position Of Lien. It is the mortgagee’s responsibility to assure that the recapture lien, 
drawn in favor of the Secretary, is properly recorded in the appropriate position. The 
recapture lien may not be junior to any lien other than an FHA -insured first li en, unless:  
1. there is a second lien held by a state or local government agency required by law to 
hold a second lien (such as a lien to secure repayment of funds advanced under a 
housing assistance program to make the initial cash investment or to assist in making 
mort gage payments); or  
2. HUD has determined that it would be in the Secretary’s best interest to accept a junior 
lien position.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  D. Preparation Of Closing Documents. Upon approval of Form HUD -93100 -4 on Section 
235 cases subject to the recapture provision, the HUD Field Office will add the following 
paragraph as a condition to its firm commitment:  
“Second mortgage with addendum, and note in the format prescribed by HUD to be 
executed and recorded for the maximum amount of assistance as established by Formula 
II which could be paid over the term of the mortgage. $______________ (Amount to be 
entered on second note and mortgage (or deed of trust)”.  
1. Security Instruments. Upon issuance of a firm commitment, the HUD Field Office 
having jurisdiction over the mortgage will instruct the mortgagee to modify the HUD -
approved mortgage or deed of trust document for insured mortgages in that particular 
State to  include the information for the Section 235 recapture mortgage or deed of 
trust, as follows:  
a. under the document caption, insert the words “with Addendum, for Repayment of 
Section 235 Assistance”;  
b. enter the words “the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development” as the 
mortgagee and delete any reference to a corporation;  
c. delete any reference to monthly installments;  
d. enter a statement that the principal sum of the mortgage will not exceed the 
amount computed under the note. The following language is acceptable:  
“. . . but not to exceed an amount computed under the terms of a note executed by 
the mortgagor on _________________; with interest, if any, according to the 
terms of the note.”;  
e. delete the two paragraphs relating to the payment of escrow items; and  
f. an addendum should also be added to provide for the special repayment 
provisions required by Section 235.  
NOTE: The Note must be reproduced locally. HUD Field Office Counsel shall 
review model security instruments to be used to determine that they comply with 
local law and meet HUD requirements.  
2. Information to be Inserted. The mortgagee completes these documents by inserting 
the following information:  
a. appropriate dates;  
b. names;  
c. property description;  
d. interest rate (which will be the same as the rate on the first mortgage); and  
e. the maximum amount of assistance that may be paid over the full term of the 
mortgage.

F. Hazard Insurance . The Secretary does not need to be named as a payee in the hazard 
insurance policy.  
11-5 REQUIREMENTS AT CLOSING.  The originating mortgagee is responsible for the 
following at the time of closing:  
A. Execution Of Lien Documents (24  CFR 235.12(d)). The documents creating the lien in 
favor of the Secretary shall be executed at the same time as those creating the first lien.  
B. Identifying Costs. Costs associated with the transaction may be paid by either the buyer 
or the seller, subject to the usual underwriting restrictions on such costs. Costs associated 
with both mortgages may be shown on the same HUD -1, Settlement Statement,  as long as 
the HUD -1 clearly reflects what the costs were for and which costs were paid by the 
seller and which were paid by the purchaser.  
11-6 RECORDING THE LIENS.  The documents creating the second lien should be delivered 
for recording at the same time as those creating the first lien. It is the mortgagee’s responsibility 
to assure that the liens are recorded in the proper order.  
NOTE: Should the recapture lien be inadvertently recorded in first -lien position, HUD will agree 
to subordinate its lien to correct this error as the mortgagee’s lien will not be insurable if it is not 
in first -lien position.  
11-7 INSURANCE ENDORSEMENT.  The mortgagee’s lien is submitted for mortgage 
insurance endorsement in the normal manner, accompanied by the following documents: the 
executed, original “Notice to Buyer”; a copy of the Note in favor of the Secretary; and copies of 
the executed security instruments with evidence that the originals have been delivered for 
recording (unless the original, recorded documents have been returned before the case is 
submitted for insurance endorsement).  
NOTE: The application for FHA insurance will not be processed unless it is accompanied by the 
Notice to Buyer.  
A. Where it is not customary for recorders to provide receipts for documents accepted for 
recording, the mortgagee’s certification will be accepted as adequate evidence that the 
original documents have been delivered for recording.  
B. When the original documents have been recorded and returned, they are to be forwarded 
immediately to the appropriate HUD Field Office with the original note in favor of the 
Secretary. They will be retained by that HUD Field Office until the lien is satisfi ed.

outlined in Chapter 10 until one of the events described in Paragraph 11 -9 occurs which will 
“trigger” the recapture provision.  
NOTE: Should the mortgagee find at any time that a case is not under the Recapture Program, 
but that a second mortgage (or deed of trust) with addendum and a note was executed by the 
mortgagor and recorded by the mortgagee, the mortgagee must contact the H UD Field Office, 
single Family Loan Management Branch. The insurance binder must be reviewed by HUD and a 
justification prepared for satisfying the HUD lien without calculating a recapture amount.  
11-9 EVENTS TRIGGERING RECAPTURE PROVISION (24  CFR 235.12(a)).  The 
recapture provision is “triggered ” when any one of the following events occurs:  
A. a property is sold to a party not eligible for assistance;  
B. the mortgage is assumed by a party eligible for assistance but does not agree to accept 
assistance and/or assume liability for repayment of assistance paid on behalf of the seller 
(and previous mortgagors);  
C. a property is rented (or, in the case of properties with more than one unit, the owner’s 
unit is rented) for more than one year; or  
D. the mortgagor (or the mortgagor’s agent) requests that the Secretary’s lien be released.  
11-10 FORMULA FOR CALCULATING RECAPTURE (24  CFR 235.12(b) and (c)). When 
the recapture provision is “triggered ”, the amount of recapture shall be determined by HUD to be 
THE LESSER OF:  
A. the total amount of assistance paid on behalf of the mortgagor (and any previous 
mortgagors); or  
B. 50 percent of the net appreciation (as determined by HUD) of a property.  
NOTE: Net appreciation is any increase in the value of a property over the original 
purchase price, minus reasonable costs of sale, costs of refinancing the first mortgage or 
cost of the appraisal when paying off the HUD lien, and minus the reasonable cost s of 
improvements made to a property.  
11-11 MORTGAGEE’S ROLE IN RECAPTURE PROCESS.  Whenever one of the events 
described in Paragraph 11 -9 occurs, the mortgagee is charged with the responsibility for the 
following:  
A. Advising both the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction over the mortgage and the HUD 
Headquarters Office of Finance and Accounting, Subsidy Accounting Branch that an 
event has occurred which “triggers” the recapture provision. This notification shall 
inclu de as much information as the mortgagee has available (i.e., FHA case number, the 
date of a prepayment associated with a sale; the name and address of the assumptor, if the

and all assumptors, if any, less handling charges and the total of any assistance payments 
which may have been inadvertently applied to the mortgagor’s account.  
C. Providing copies of original documents (i.e., signed settlement statements, sales 
contract s, etc., which are contained in the mortgagee’s case file) that the mortgagor 
cannot provide, but are needed by HUD to determine the amount of recapture due to 
satisfy the HUD lien.  
D. Serving as the “go -between” where necessary and advising the mortgagor of the 
documentation required to calculate the recapture amount due HUD.  
NOTE: THE MORTGAGEE MUST NOT CALCULATE THE RECAPTURE 
AMOUNT.  
NOTE: If the mortgagee receives the recapture amount due either directly from the 
mortgagor or as a disbursement from closing, the mortgagee shall promptly forward these 
funds directly to the local HUD Office.  
THE MORTGAGEE MUST NOT ASSUME ANY DUTIES CONCERNING THE 
CALCULATION OF THE RECAPTURE AMOUNT.  
E. Verifying and certifying that all appropriate recertifications (from the time of inception 
through the time of termination of the assistance payments contract) have been correctly 
processed and billed.  
At the request of a Field Office, the mortgagee shall submit recertifications for review by 
that Field Office before the recapture process begins.  
F. Repaying any overpaid assistance (that may have been discovered as a result of 
Paragraph 11 -11E) as described in Chapter 10.  
NOTE:  Any amounts of overpaid assistance paid to HUD because of this requirement are 
to be so indicated and subtracted from the amount reported in compliance with Paragraph 
11-11B.  
Any overpaid assistance should be handled as a separate transaction from the recapture 
amount when processing a recapture case for satisfaction of HUD’s lien.  
NOTE: If a check for an overpaid assistance amount is received or if the overpaid 
assistance is included in the same check as the recapture amount, the check must be 
forwarded to HUD Headquarters, Office of Finance and Accounting and a copy should be

10-19. 
NOTE: If the mortgagor is refinancing the first mortgage, the mortgagee is charged with 
the responsibility for items B, D, E, F, and G.  
11-12 HUD'S ROLE IN THE RECAPTURE PROCESS.  When the local HUD Field Office is 
advised by a mortgagee, an attorney, a title  company or other settlement party, of a pending or 
accomplished event which triggers recapture (as listed in Paragraph 11 -9), the HUD Field Office 
may request the following items in order to compute the recapture amount due to satisfy the 
HUD lien:  
A. a copy of the recorded second mortgage (or deed of trust) with addendum and executed 
note (should the HUD Field Office not have the original documents in its files);  
B. a copy of the executed sales contract  and HUD -1 settlement statement (signed by the 
settlement attorney) where the original mortgagor purchased the property;  
C. a copy of the executed sales contract  and HUD -1 settlement statement (signed by the 
settlement attorney) of any assumptor who purchased the property prior to the last 
mortgagor;  
D. a copy of the executed sales contract  and HUD -1 settlement statement (signed by the 
settlement attorney) when the last mortgagor (i.e., the last one receiving assistance) sold 
the property;  
E. copies of paid receipts and/or bills marked “paid in full” for any improvements made to a 
property (by the original mortgagor and/or any assumptor);  
F. a letter from the mortgagee, signed by an officer of the company, stating the total amount 
of assistance paid on behalf of the original mortgagor and all assumptors (if any).  
G. an appraisal report on the property and a statement of the cost of the appraisal, if needed; 
and 
H. a statement of the costs of refinancing the first mortgage, when needed.  
11-13 DETERMINING THE RECAPTURE AMOUNT.  To determine the recapture amount 
for a Section 235 recapture case, the documentation requested in Paragraph 11 -12 must be 
reviewed. A formula is used to calculate the recapture amount. The cost of sale (or the cost of 
refinancing the first mortgage) and the cost of improvements to a property are subtracted from 
the appreciation of the property to arrive at net appreciation. See Paragraph 11 -10.

Handbook 4000.1  1430  
Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  11-14 REASONABLE COSTS OF SALE.  Since the title  of the property changes when the 
property is sold, the costs of sale must clearly indicate which costs were paid by the seller and 
which were paid by the purchaser and are subject to the usual underwriting restrictions on such 
costs. Costs of sale shall a lso conform to what is considered by the local HUD Field Office to be 
reasonable and customary for that area of the country. Otherwise, the excess will be disallowed. 
Costs of sale must be clearly identified on a HUD -1, Settlement Statement, signed by the 
appropriate person. If there is no HUD -1, the costs of sale must be itemized and supported by 
receipts.  
A. Costs Allowed. Costs of sale items which HUD will allow to be claimed against the net 
appreciation of a property if the costs are paid by the original mortgagor and/or 
subsequent assumptors of the mortgage are:  
1. broker's commission;  
2. discount points (not origination fee);  
3. property survey;  
4. appraisal fee;  
5. State and local taxes (charged in connection with the transaction, such as transfer 
taxes (not property taxes or amounts escrowed for the future payment of taxes);  
6. attorney fees;  
7. fees for the preparation and recording of documents;  
8. notary fees;  
9. costs of advertising the property for sale (but not if these costs are paid by the broker 
and included in the commission);  
10. title search, but not if included in attorney's fee;  
11. title insurance;  
12. pest control inspection;  
13. pumping out septic tank as a condition of sale (where required by State law);  
14. buyer’s protection plans providing the buyer with a warranty as to the condition of the 
property and covering repair or replacement of certain elements of the property for a 
limited time; and/or  
15. any other costs resulting from a State and/or local requirement.  
B. Costs Not Allowed.  
1. buydown fee (If there are no discount points allowed (see A.2. above), the buydown 
fee can be claimed against the appreciation of the property);  
2. tax funding service fee; and  
3. VA funding fee.  
11-15 REASONABLE COST OF REFINANCING THE FIRST MORTGAGE . Since the 
title to a property does not change when the first mortgage is refinanced, the costs of refinancing 
do not include all of the costs allowed for costs of sale when a property is sold. Refinancing costs 
must be clearly identified on a HUD -1, Settlement Statement,  signed by the appropriate person. 
If there isn't a HUD -1, the cost of refinancing should be itemized and supported by receipts.

the costs of assuming the mortgage (for each transaction) can be claimed against the 
appreciation of a property if the charges are documented. Costs of refinancing the  first 
mortgage which HUD will allow to be claimed against the appreciation of a property (if 
the costs are paid by the last eligible mortgagor) are:  
1. appraisal fee;  
2. one discount point (not origination fee);

4. mortgagor's title  insurance (title of property).  
11-16 REASONABLE COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS.  
A. To qualify As An Improvement. Improvements must be over and above deferred or 
routine maintenance to be allowed as claims against the appreciation of a property. They 
must be:  
1. acceptable to HUD;  
2. improvements that were not present or a part of a property at the time the mortgage 
was originated, unless it is an upgrade (see Paragraph 11 -16B9 below);  
3. considered to be permanent improvements in that they will remain with a property 
when it is sold as they cannot be removed from the property without causing damage 
to existing structures and/or the property; and  
4. improvements for which the mortgagor can substantiate the cost with documented 
proof that such improvements were done to the mortgaged property site and for which 
the mortgagor has receipts marked “paid -in-full” as required in Paragraph 11 -12E. 
B. Allowable Improvements. Acceptable types of improvements which HUD will allow to 
be claimed against the appreciation of a property when computing the recapture amount 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

4. appliance additions (stoves, refrigerators, built -in dishwashers, built -in microwave 
ovens, clothes washers and dryers, and attic and ceiling fans) which are conveyed to 
buyer by seller;  
NOTE: If items in #4 above are replacement items, they are not allowed against the 
appreciation of a property.  
If the mortgagor bought original appliances after purchase of a new property, original 
costs of appliances can be claimed against the appreciation of a property. (In some 
sections of the country, appliances are not furnished by the builder, unless requeste d 
by the mortgagor.)  
Portable appliances are not allowed against the appreciation of a property.  
The Field Office Evaluation staff shall be notified on a case -by-case basis to 
determine whether washers and dryers or other such permanent fixtures that are 
considered to be regional appreciation value assets can be claimed against the 
appreciation of a p roperty.  
5. finishing or refinishing of basements or other rooms when the area was unfinished at 
the time of origination or the refinishing substantially alters the nature of the area and 
enhances the value of a property;  
6. the addition of storm windows and/or doors or replacing regular windows with 
replacement windows (for the purpose of saving energy);  
7. installation of permanent heating or cooling systems where none existed, the addition 
of a solar heating system or replacing a conventional heating system with a solar 
heating system;  
8. carpeting areas where floors were previously without finished coverings (such as, a 
room addition, or a basement area);  
9. upgrading: appliances, cabinets, carpeting, electrical and plumbing fixtures, etc.  
NOTE: If the mortgagor upgraded an item that the builder was to install at the time 
the structure was erected, the cost of the improvement is the difference in price for 
upgrading. If such items are replaced, the replacements cannot be claimed against the 
appreciation of a property.  
10. television dish. (If the dish is listed in the sales contract  and/or appraisal report and 
cannot be removed from the property without damaging the landscape, it can be 
claimed against the appreciation of the property.)  
11. sheds and outbuildings. (If structures enhance a property and cannot be removed 
without damaging the landscape, they can be claimed against the appreciation of a 
property.)

NOTE: The HUD Field Office must be contacted for guidance in handling special 
assessments and land issues as improvements and their costs as claims against the 
appreciation of a property.  
C. Miscellaneous Improvements Of Less Than $100 Per Project. Miscellaneous 
improvements which are less than $100 per project are to be considered incidentals and 
are not to be allowed as a claim against the appreciation of a property. Included in this 
categor y are such items as molding, weatherstripping, sod, grass seed, fertilizer, etc.  
D. Group Improvements As Projects. When a major improvement which involve the 
purchase/rental of numerous items of equipment and/or materials is claimed, it must be 
grouped together as one project. However, each item purchased for that project must 
reflect it s own separate cost.  
E. “Sweat Equity ”. Where the work is performed by the mortgagor (i.e., “sweat equity”), no 
monetary value will be given for the “sweat equity” with respect to being used as a claim 
against the appreciation of a property. However, the cost of building permits, inspections,  
renting items of equipment and purchasing the supplies and materials necessary to

utility knives, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wrenches, caulking guns, cement trowels, 
etc. 
G. Where The Cost Of An Improvement Is Paid Using A Monthly Installment Payment 
Plan. Where an improvement is paid for on a monthly installment plan (whether paid to 
the company providing the service, a bank, a credit card company, etc.) only the initial 
cost of the improvement (excluding any interest, finance charges or late charges) may be 
used as a claim against the appreciation of a property.  
H. Receipts/Documentation Of Improvements. In order to support the cost of an 
improvement, the mortgagor must present receipts or invoices on company letterhead 
marked “paid -in-full” for each allowable home improvement. Receipts which are written 
on paper wit hout a business letterhead, or without specific (or legible) entries as to what 
service was provided, who provided the service, the date the service was provided, and/or 
what type of material was purchased, and where appropriate, at what property address t he 
service was performed, etc., may be subject to further scrutiny and/or rejection by the 
HUD Field Office.

Last Revised: 10/31 /2023  NOTE: Occurrences such as these, will lead to the HUD Field Office questioning the 
mortgagor’s need for assistance and/or the possibility of fraud in the original application process.  
11-18 CALCULATING THE RECAPTURE AMOUNT.  
A. Calculating The Recapture Amount. The HUD Field Office shall calculate the amount of 
recapture due in order to satisfy the lien using the formula shown in Paragraph 11 -10 and 
on the Recapture of Assistance Payments Worksheet. Only the HUD Field Office shal l 
calculate the amount of assistance to be recaptured.  
B. Selling Price. If the HUD Field Office feels that the reported selling price is substantially 
below the property value or discovers that the property is being sold for less than the 
amount for which it was purchased, the HUD Field Office has the option of requesting 
that the mortgagee obtain an appraisal of the property.  
NOTE: If the appraised value is five (5) percent or more above the sales contract  price, 
the recapture will be based on the appraised value rather than the selling price shown on 
the sales contract.  
11-19 DISPOSITION OF THE RECAPTURE CHECK.  The HUD Field Office has the 
responsibility of collecting the recapture amount from the mortgagor or the mortgagor’s 
representative. Should the recapture amount be collected by the mortgagee, the check must be 
forwarded to the appropriate HUD Field Office  and the Office shall forward it to a lockbox in 
Atlanta, Georgia.  
11-20 RELEASING THE RECAPTURE LIEN.  Upon receiving the full recapture amount 
required to satisfy the second mortgage, or second deed of trust, the HUD Field Office will 
prepare, execute, record and forward the recorded Satisfaction of Lien to the mortgagee or the 
agent representing the mort gagor. The mortgagee or mortgagor’s agent will then be responsible 
for forwarding the document to the mortgagor.  
11-21 SATISFYING THE LIEN BEFORE OBTAINING RECAPTURE AMOUNT.  If the 
settlement on a property is imminent, the second mortgage or second deed of trust has not been 
satisfied, and there is a request to satisfy the lien before closing, the mortgagor must be informed 
that since there is not enough time to do the recapt ure formula to determine the recapture 
amount, the full amount of assistance paid on the mortgagor’s behalf must be submitted to HUD 
so that the HUD lien can be satisfied before settlement of the mortgage. When the recapture 
calculation has been completed, if there is an overpayment, the overpayment shall be refunded to 
the mortgagor.  
11-22 ASSIGNMENT TO HUD.  In those cases where the HUD Field Office has decided to 
accept an assignment of the first mortgage, the recapture lien shall remain in place. The 
mortgagee must advise both the HUD Field Office and the HUD Headquarters Office of Finance 
and Accounting, G PA - Subsidized Housing Programs Division, Attention: Accounts Payable 
Section (the mailing address on Form HUD -93102) in writing, signed by an officer of the 
company, of the total amount of assistance paid through the date of assig nment.

signed by an officer of the company, of the total amount of assistance paid over the term of the 
mortgage. It will not be necessary for HUD to prepare a satisfaction of lien for the HUD lien. A 
foreclosure that is properly processed by the mortgagee’s foreclosing attorney will wipe out all 
existing liens on the property, including HUD’s lien. However, if the HUD lien exists after 
foreclosure of the first mortgage, the HUD Field Office must satisf y the lien at the request of the 
foreclosing attorney.  
11-24 DEED -IN-LIEU OF FORECLOSURE.  For the mortgage that is conveyed to HUD as a 
result of a deed -in-lieu of foreclosure , the recapture lien shall remain in place. The mortgagee 
must advise the HUD Field Office, in writing, signed by an officer of the company, of the total 
amount of assistance paid over the term of the mortgage.  
NOTE: Once the property is in HUD’s Property Disposition inventory, the HUD Field Office 
will prepare and record a satisfaction of the recapture lien in order to provide a clear title  when 
the property is sold by HUD.  
11-25 RELOCATION OF MORTGAGOR BY EMPLOYER.  
A. Termination Of Assistance. If an employer requires a Section 235 mortgagor to relocate, 
and the employer assumes the responsibility of selling the mortgagor’s property, the 
mortgagee must terminate the assistance at the appropriate time. (Chapter 10, Parag raph 
10-19.) The mortgagee must furnish the HUD Field Office with a statement of the total 
amount of assistance paid on behalf of the original mortgagor and any assumptors of the 
mortgage.  
B. Value Of Property. The mortgagee must provide the HUD Field Office with an appraisal 
to determine the fair market value of a property or the HUD Field Office must request an 
appraisal of the property.  
11-26 DISLOCATION OF MORTGAGOR (EMINENT DOMAIN).  
A. Relocate To Another Property. If a State or local government dislocates a Section 235 
mortgagor because it needs the property for public use, the mortgagor may relocate to 
another property under the same mortgage. The FHA case number must remain the same 
for the purpose of paying assistance on the mortgagor’s behalf.  
1. The State or local government must NOT pay the first mortgage in full.  
2. The mortgagee must agree to transfer the first and second mortgages or first and 
second deeds of trust to a new property.  
3. The mortgagee must amend the first and second mortgages or deeds of trust security 
instruments to read the legal de scription of the new property.

B. Unable To Transfer Mortg ages.  If the mortgagor is unable to get the first and second 
mortgages or first and second deeds of trust on a property transferred to another property 
of equal value, the State or local government must purchase t he property from the 
mortgagor.  The mortgagee must contact the HUD Field Office of the ending sale of the 
property.  The HUD Field Office must take the appropriate steps to satisfy the HUD lien 
on the property.  
11-27 SUBORDINATION OF THE HUD LIEN. If subordination of the HUD lien on a 
property is in the best interest of the Secretary, the HUD Field Office may approve subordination 
of a recapture lien in the case of refinancing a first mortgage or securing a Title  I loan for 
improving the property. The mortgagee must contact the HUD Field Office for details on 
subordinating the HUD lien.  
11-28 SUMMARY.  The appropriate HUD Field Office should be notified if any one of the 
following events occurs:  
A. The first mortgage on a property has been paid in full through sale of the property.

In C. above, the mortgagee refinancing the first mortgage should notify the HUD Field Office if 
it (the mortgagee) wants the HUD lien satisfied due to the fact that the HUD lien moves into 
first-lien position when the original first mortgage is paid -in-full. 
In D. above, if the first mortgage is assigned to HUD, the mortgagee must submit a statement of 
the full amount of assistance paid by HUD on behalf of the original mortgagor and all 
assumptors of the mo rtgage to the HUD Field Office.  In E. above, the HUD Field Office must 
calculate the recapture amount and maintain a file on the  case. In F. above, the HUD Field Office 
must request a decision from the mortgagor as to whether he/she wants the HUD lien satisfied 
after termination of the assistance.  
In G., above, there are specific procedures to follow for processing the relocation case.  For the 
dislocation case, there are special conditions that must be considered to retain the original first 
mortgage and Section 235 assistance by transferring both to a nother property of equal value.  In

changes in escrow requ irements.  Mortgagees may, however, elect to analyze Section 235 
escrow accounts at any time, provided assistance is recomputed at the time of annual 
recertification to reflect any changes in the mortgagor’s income or family composition, as 
well as the ann ual change in MIP . (See Chapter 10 for detailed instructions .)

ix. SCRA Interest Rate Cap  
Formerly Mortgagee Letter 2006 -28 Mortgage and Foreclosure  Rights of 
Servicemembers under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)  
A few Section 235 mortgages still have assistance payments from HUD applied to them on 
behalf of lower -income mortgagors.  Assistance for these mortgages may be affected by the six 
percent interest rate limitation.  On all accounts receiving assistance when the note rate of interest 
exceeds six percent, the amount of assistance must be reanalyzed, and the subsidy amount must 
be recalculated using the full mortgage payment at a six percent rate when determ ining the 
amount of assistance.  For some accounts, the interest rate deduction will cause the suspension of 
assistance for the period of active duty. Whenever an interest rate reduction is made with 
retroactive effect and the Section 235 assistance is reduced, any ove r-billed subsidy must be 
returned to HUD as a refund or adjustment to the subsequen t Section 235 monthly billing. When 
active duty terminates and the note rate resumes, the assistance must be recalculated and restored 
in accorda nce with the usual procedures. Any income recertification requests received from 
mortgagors in accordance with 24  CFR §  235.355 mu st be processed expeditiously. Please also 
reference ML 91 -20, Effect of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act of 1940  on FHA Insured 
Mortgages  for additional guidance in calculating Formula 2 subsidy.

and that the Deferral Period has ended unless the default is cured within 30 Days.  
If the default is not cured within such time, the Mortgagee must proceed in 
accordance with applicable time  frames  to initiate foreclosure  and reasonable 
diligence in prosecuting foreclosure.  
If a default is cured at any time prior to a foreclosure  sale, the Mortgagee must

provisions  for an Eligible NBS  are met.  
(3) HECMs with Set -Aside  Accounts  
For HECMs with Set -Aside  accounts for paying Property Charges , the HECM 
will be considered in default and eligible for Due and Payable  status if:  
• the Set-Aside account has been exhausted of available funds to make 
property charge payments;

applicable origination requiremen ts; 
 state, local , or other government  assistance programs available for 
Borrower s; and  
 disposition options including sale of Property or DIL . 
(C) Requesting Due and Payable  
If a property charge default has not been cured within 30 Days of notifying the 
Borrower of unpaid Property Charges , the Mortgagee must submit to HUD a Due and 
Payable  request, in accordance with the Due and Payable  policies . 
Where the Mortgagee is willing to offer the HECM Borrower an available Loss 
Mitigation Option , the Mortgagee may request a property charge loss mitigation 
extension to the foreclosure  time frame in HERMIT  following the guidance in the 
Mortgagee Extension for Property Charge  Loss Mitigation  section.  
(D) Permissible Loss Mitigation Option s Available for HECMs in Due and 
Payable  Status  
If the Loss Mitigation Option s identified in the Property Charge  Delinquency  letter  
are unavailable, have been declined by the Borrower, or have been otherwise 
exhausted, the Mortgagee  may review the Borrower for  the following:  
• Option 1:  Repayment Plan  to satisfy outstanding corporate advances ma de for 
property charge defaults; or  
• Option 2: an extension of the foreclosure  time frames due to an At-Risk 
HECM Borrower . 
The Mortgagee will not be reimbursed for any amount greater than the MCA , even if 
the HECM balance exceeds 100  percent  of the MCA  due to the Mortgagee providing 
a Repayment Plan . In addition, a HECM with an active Repayment Plan is not 
eligible for assignment to HUD.  
(1) Option 1: HECM Loss Mitigation Repayment Plan  
The Mortgagee must determine the Borrower’s ability to support, and likelihood 
of success under, a Repayment Plan  before offering this Loss Mitigation Option . 
If the Borrower will not be able to repay the corporate advance within the 
permissible time, this Loss Mitigation Option is not available. Additionally, any 
permissible Repayment Plan must provide that in the event the last surviving 
Borrower dies before  the Repayment Plan is paid in full, any outstanding amounts 
owed become immediately due and must be satisfied within 30 Days.  
The Mortgagee must follow the steps below when evaluating a Borrower for a 
Repayment Plan .

Handbook 4000.1   1496  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (a) Assessing the Borrower for a Repayment Plan  
When assessing a Borrower for a Repayment Plan , the Mortgagee must  
evaluate the Borrower ’s ability  to repay the Mortgagee’s corporate advances 
through a Repayment Plan  by using the financial information provided by the 
Borrower  and the calculation instructions below.  
The Mortgagee must determine the shortest  time period  necessary , not to 
exceed five years,  for the Repayment Plan  to ensure repayment at the earliest 
possible date. 
(b) Repayment Plan  Calculation  
(i) Calculate Total Arrearage  
The total arrearage is determined by adding the outstanding corporate 
advances for taxes and/or insurance made for the account to any Property 
Charges  due for the next 90 Days.   
(ii) Calculate Monthly Surplus Income  
The HECM Borrower’s monthly surplus income is the total amount of 
income as stated by the Borrower, less:  
• the Borrower’s necessary living expenses; and  
• one-twelfth of the Property Charges  due over the next 12 months.  
(iii) Calculate Repayment Plan  Terms  
The Mortgagee must determine if the Repayment Plan  can be achieved 
using 25 percent of the Borrower’s monthly surplus income. If the total 
amount divided by 25 percent of the Borrower’s monthly surplus income, 
rounded up to the nearest whole month, is:  
• 60 months or less, the result is the required length of the 
Repayment Plan ; or 
• more than 60 months, the Mortgagee must determine the 
percentage of the Borrower’s monthly surplus income needed to 
repay in 60 months:  
 if the resulting percentage would represent a reasonable 
expectation of the Borrower’s performance, the required length 
of the Repayment Plan  is 60 months; or  
 if the resulting percentage would represent an unreasonable 
expectation of the Borrower’s performance, the Borrower’s 
surplus income is insufficient to support a Repayment Plan  and 
this option is no longer available.  
The required minimum monthly payment equals the total arrearage 
divided by the length of the Repayment Plan .

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (iv) Insufficient Surplus Income for a Repayment Plan  
Where the Mortgagee determines that the Borrower’s surplus income is 
insufficient to support a reasonable Repayment Plan , the Mortgagee may 
assess the Borrower for an At-Risk extension . 
(c) Additional Unpaid Property Charges  or Hardship Experienced after 
Establishing a Repayment Plan  
(i) Additional Unpaid Property Charges  
In cases where there is an active Repayment Plan , the Mortgagee may re -
evaluate the Borrower for a new Repayment Plan  if the Borrower again 
fails to pay the required Property Charges . The Mortgagee must solicit 
new financial information from the Borrower to conduct this assessment.  
To revise the Repayment Plan  the Mortgagee must use a recalculated total 
arrearage, including all outstanding corporate advances made.  
The Mortgagee must determine the maximum permitted length of a new 
Repayment Plan  by subtracting the number of months of previous 
Repayment Plan participation from 60 months, which is the maximum 
available time frame. The Mortgagee must then determine if the new 
Repayment Plan can be achieved using 25 percent of the Borrower’s 
monthly surplus income. If the revised total amount divided by 25 percent 
of the Borrower’s monthly surplus income, rounded up to the nearest 
whole month, is:  
• no more than the maximum permitted length as calculated above , 
the result is the required length of the new Repayment Plan ; or 
• more than the maximum permitted length, the Mortgagee must 
determine the percentage of the Borrower’s monthly surplus 
income needed to repay within the permitted time period:  
 if the resulting percentage would represent a reasonable 
expectation of the Borrower’s performance, the required length 
of the new Repayment Plan  is the maximum permitted time; or  
 if the resulting percentage would represent an unreasonable 
expectation of the Borrower’s performance, the Borrower’s 
surplus income is insufficient to support a new Repayment 
Plan and this option is no longer available.  
The required minimum monthly payment for a new Repayment Plan  
equals the revised total arrearage divided by the length of the new 
Repayment Plan.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (ii) Experienced Hardships  
If the Borrower experiences a decrease in their surplus income due to a 
verified hardship (e.g., illness, death of a household member who was 
identified as a contributor of income in a previous Repayment Plan  
calculation, emergency home repair, loss of employment income, etc.) and 
requests a Repayment Plan adjustment, the Mortgagee must solicit new 
financial information from the Borrower to conduct a new Repayment 
Plan assessment.  
To revise the Repayment Plan  the Mortgagee must use a recalculated 
Borrower’s surplus income amount.  
The Mortgagee must determine the maximum permitted length of a new 
Repayment Plan  by subtracting the number of months of previous 
Repayment Plan participation from 60 months, which is the maximum 
available time frame. The Mortgagee must then determine if the new 
Repayment Plan can be achieved using 25 percent of the Borrower’s new 
mont hly surplus income. If the total amount divided by 25 percent of the 
Borrower’s new monthly surplus income, rounded up to the nearest whole 
month, is:  
• no more than the maximum permitted length as calculated above , 
the result is the required length of the new Repayment Plan ; or 
• more than the maximum permitted length, the Mortgagee must 
determine the percentage of the Borrower’s new monthly surplus 
income needed to repay within the permitted time:  
 if the resulting percentage would represent a reasonable 
expectation of the Borrower’s performance, the required length 
of the new Repayment Plan  is the maximum permitted time; or  
 if the resulting percentage would represent an unreasonable 
expectation of the Borrower’s performance, the Borrower’s 
surplus income is insufficient to support a new Repayment 
Plan and this option is no longer available.  
The required minimum monthly payment for a new Repayment Plan  
equals the total arrearage divided by the length of the new Repayment 
Plan.  
(iii) Insufficient Surplus Income for a New Repayment Plan  
Where the Mortgagee determines that the Borrower’s surplus income is 
insufficient to support a reasonable new Repayment Plan , the Mortgagee 
may assess the Borrower for an At-Risk extension .

Handbook 4000.1   1499  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (d) Unsuccessful Repayment Plan  Performance  
A Borrower’s Repayment Plan  performance is unsuccessful when a full 
monthly payment is not made within 60 Days of the monthly payment due 
date.  
Where a Borrower fails to perform successfully under an existing Repayment 
Plan, the Mortgagee may consider one of the following options:  
• if the outstanding arrearage is less than or equal to $5,000  and the 
Mortgagee determines that a recalculated Repayment Plan  results in 
reasonable payments, provide the Borrower with such; or  
• if the outstanding arrearage is greater than $5,000 or the Mortgagee 
determines that a recalculated Repayment Plan  results in unreasonable 
payments, assess the Borrower for an  At-Risk extension . 
If a Repayment Plan  is unsuccessful and either the Mortgagee chooses not to 
offer one of the above options or, after considering the options, determines 
neither is available, any extension to the foreclosure  time frames cease 
immediately and the Mortgagee must proceed in accordance with HUD’s 
regulations. However, the Mortgagee may receive an automatic 90 -Day 
extension after a failed Repayment Plan to resume or restart foreclosure.  
(e) Repayment Plans  Satisfied Immediately Upon Death  
Any approved property charge loss mitigation extension immediately ceases 
when the last surviving Borrower dies. Any outstanding corporate advances 
owed become immediately due. If any amount owed is not satisfied within 30 
Days, the Mortgagee must proceed with calling the HECM Due and Payable . 
If any outstanding amounts due are satisfied, the Mortgagee must request that 
the Due and Payable  status on the HECM related to the repayment of any 
approved Property Charges  be rescinded.  
(2) Option 2: Allowable Foreclosure  Extensions for At -Risk HECM 
Borrowers  
(a) Definition  
An At -Risk HECM Borrower refers to a Borrower who is in default for 
unpaid Property Charges , has insufficient surplus income to support a 
Repayment Plan , or was unsuccessful in their Repayment Plan and meets the 
following criteria:  
• the y oungest living Borrower is at least 80 years of age; and 
• the Mortgagee has determined that the Borrower or Family Member  
receiving care in the residence has critical circumstances such as a 
supported terminal illness or substantiated long -term physical disability.

If the last surviving Borrower dies or one of the required criteria cease to be 
met, any approved extension ceases immediately  and the Mortgagee must 
proceed in accordance with HUD’s regulations . 
(c) Required Documentation  
The Mortgagee  must include supporting documentation with the extension 
request validating that the Borrower meets the definition of an At -Risk 
Borrower . 
(E) Optional Delay to Submit a Due and Payable  Request for Low Balance 
Arrearages  
The Mortgagee may delay submitting a due and payable request to HUD for HECMs  
with a total arrearage amount associated with property taxes and Hazard Insurance  
that is $2,000  or less  by uploading documentation into HERMIT  establishing  that 
either : 
• the Mortgagee  is unable to contact the Borrower, and:  
 the Mortgagee has received the Borrower’s  current annual Occupancy 
Certification ; and  
 the Mortgagee  has no indication that the Borrower  has vacated the 
Property; or

Borrower using the Mortgagee’s own funds. This payment is a Mortgagee -Funded 
Cure . The Mortgagee may not pursue assignment for a HECM until three  consecutive 
years have passed where the Borrower  has paid all taxes and insurance on time and 
the Mortgagee  has not advanced any funds on the Borrower ’s behalf.

i. Disaster Declarations  
Under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief  and Emergency Assistance Act, the 
President has authority to declare a major disaster for any area which has been affected 
by damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance. 
Disaster declarations and information regarding available federal assistance for each 
disaster incident are posted on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 
website . 
Whenever the President declares a major disaster, the Mortgagee must implement the 
procedures set forth in this section for each designated area that is eligible for federal 
disaster assistance.  
ii. Moratorium on Foreclosures  
(A) Standard  
The Mortgagee must observe a moratorium on foreclosures of FHA -insured HECMs  
secured by Properties located in Presidentially -Declared Major Disaster Area s 
(PDMDA) following the disaster declaration. The foreclosure  moratorium is:  
• applicable only if the HECM is Due and Payable  for reasons other than the 
death of the last remaining Borrower and is not subject to a Deferral Period ; 
• effective for a 90 -Day period beginning on the date of the disaster declaration 
for that area (HUD may communicate further specific guidance for extension 
of moratorium periods for individual disasters);  and 
• applicable to the initiation of foreclosures and foreclosures already in process . 
During the foreclosure  moratorium, Mortgagees are granted an automatic 90 -Day 
extension for all servicing deadlines, including the deadlines for requesting to call a 
HECM Due and Payable  and providing notice to HUD of loans which have 
automatically become Due and Payable.  
HUD provides the Mortgagee an automatic 90 -Day extension from the date of the 
moratorium expiration date to commence or recommence foreclosure  action or 
evaluate the Borrower for loss mitigation. Where foreclosure has not been initiated, 
the Mortgagee may submit a request for an extension to HUD’s foreclosure -related 
deadlines through  Home Equity Reverse Mortgage Information Technology  
(HERMIT ) when prohibited from performing a required activity due to the 
foreclosure moratorium.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 v. Termination and Reinstatement of the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  
If an NBS  fails to meet, or ceases to meet at any time, the definition of a n Eligible 
Surviving NBS , the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  terminates immediately and there 
is no opportunity to cure the failure to meet this required definition.  
When the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  ceases or is determined to be unavailable 
solely because the HECM is eligible to be called Due and Payable  for a reason other than 
the death of the Borrower , the Mortgagee must provide a n Eligible Surviving NBS  30 
Days to cure the default and reinstate the MOE Assignment Deferral Period  as follows:  
• all defaults must be cured in fact within the time period permitted; a default is not 
cured by entering into a Repayment Plan ; 
• if the default is cured within such time, the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  
must be reinstated, unless:  
 reinstatement of the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  has occurred within the 
past two years immediately preceding the current notification to the Eligible 
Surviving NBS  that the HECM is Due and Payable ; 
 reinstatement of the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  will preclude 
foreclosure  if the HECM becomes Due and Payable  at a later date; or  
 reinstatement of the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  will adversely affect 
the priority of the HECM lien;  
• if the default is not cured within such time, the Mortgagee must proceed in 
accordance with the established time frames to initiate foreclosure  and reasonable 
diligence in prosecuting foreclosure as required by 24  CFR  § 206.125 and all 
other regulations and requirements if it wishes to perfect its claim for insurance 
benefits; and  
• even after a foreclosure  proceeding begins, an Eligible Surviving NBS  may cure 
the condition which resulted in the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  ceasing, 
thus reinstating the HECM and MOE Assignment Deferral Period  and allowing 
the mortgage insurance to remain in effect. The Mortgagee may require the 
Eligible Surviving NBS  to pay any costs that the Mortgagee incurred to reinstate 
the HECM, including foreclosure costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Such costs 
may not be added to the HECM  balance and must be paid from some other source 
of funds. Such reinstatement is solely at the election of the Mortgagee.  
The Mortgagee may refuse to reinstate the HECM and the MOE Assignment  Deferral 
Period  if: 
• the Mortgagee has accepted a reinstatement of either the MOE Assignment  
Deferral Period  or HECM within the past two years immediately preceding the 
current notification to the  Eligible Surviving NBS  that the HECM is Due and 
Payable ; 
• reinstatement of either the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  or HECM will 
preclude foreclosure  if the HECM becomes Due and Payable  at a later date; or  
• reinstatement of either the MOE Assignment  Deferral Period  or HECM will 
adversely affect the priority of the HECM lien.

i. Eligibility  
Mortgagees may provide a Borrower a COVID -19 HECM Property  Charge Repayment 
Plan if the Borrower is delinquent on payment of Property Charges  and has been 
impacted by COVID -19. Borrower attestation, written or verbal, that they have been 
impacted by COVID -19 is sufficient for documenting that a Borrower has been impacted 
by COVID -19. The Mortgagee must document the Borrower’s attestation in their 
servicing file.  
ii. Length of Repayment Plan  
The maximum length of a COVID -19 HECM Property  Charge Repayment Plan  is 60 
months. This 60 -month time period is not reduced by any time that the Borrower utilized 
a standard HECM repayment plan.   
iii. Calculating the Repayment Plan   
The COVID -19 HECM Property  Charge Repayment Plan  is calculated using the 
requirements for a standard HECM repayment plan . The Borrower is eligible for a 
COVID -19 HECM Property Charge  Repayment Plan even if they have been unsuccessful 
on a prior repayment plan, the total outstanding arrearage is greater than $5,000, or both. 
All other requirements with respect to HECM Property Charge Repayment Plans apply to 
a COVID -19 HECM Property Ch arge Repayment Plan   
iv. COVID -19 HECM Property  Charge Repayment Plans  and the Homeowner 
Assistance Fund  
If the Borrower will not be able to repay the corporate advances for Property Charge  
defaults within the permissible time, the Mortgagee may offer a COVID -19 HECM 
Property  Charge Repayment Plan  if:  
• the Borrower has submitted an application for Homeowner Assistance Funds 
(HAF) as evidenced by an “A” or “I” code ; and  
• the actual HAF assistance awarded, or if no HAF assistance is awarded then up to 
the maximum amount available under the jurisdiction’s HAF program (provided 
HECM is part of the HAF program in that jurisdiction), combined with the 
Borrower’s ability to repay will result in full repayment of the outstanding 
corporate advances for Property Charge  defaults.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (B) Standard  
A Lender may sell, assign, or transfer its Title  I Loans, but only to a Lender that has 
been approved by HUD to participate in the Title I program and has an active Title I 
contract number.  
The selling Lender relinquishes all rights and obligations under the contract for loan 
insurance on the effective date of the sale. The selling Lender remains responsible for 
the Loan’s annual insurance premiums until notice of the sale is received by HUD.  
The purchasing Lender is the Lender that purchases the Loan and thereby succeeds to 
all rights and obligations of the selling Lender under the contract for loan insurance. 
As of the effective date of the sale, the purchasing Lender becomes responsible for 
outstanding annual insurance premiums, regardless of the date of accrual, and must 
confirm that the details of the loan sale have been reported accurately.  
A transfer of Title  I Loans between Lenders must be reported to HUD within 31 Days 
of the effective date of the transfer.

form HUD -27030 , Title I Transfer of Note Report,  to the FOC , Attention: Premiums 
(Title I Insurance Processing Branch).  
HUD will accept the completed form HUD -27030 from either the selling Lender or

officials from both institutions.  
Transfers of Loans for Title  I Property Improvement Loans must be submitted 
separately from Manufactured Home  Loans. The two insurance types cannot be 
submitted on the same form HUD -27030. The Lender must complete a separate form 
HUD -27030 for each insurance type being reported.  
If a large number of Loans are being transferred, a completed form HUD -27030 may 
be submitted with an attached report or electronic file attachment (such as Excel 
spreadsheet) that provides the loan level data required by the form.  
HUD will hold the selling Lender responsible for all related premium charges and 
will disburse claim payments only to the selling Lender until an appropriately 
prepared form HUD -27030 is received and processed.

HUD may transfer a Loan or group of Loans with earmarking which keeps the insurance 
coverage separate from other loans owned by the purchasing Lender. In other words, the 
insurance coverage reserves associated with the Loans being transferred remain in a 
separate account from any loans already held by the purchaser. Once a Loan is earmarked 
it remains earmarked even if it is subsequently transferred to another Lender.  
iii. Providing Information to HUD  
The Lender must respond to verbal or written requests for individual account 
information, including all servicing information and related data and the entire loan 
origination file, from HUD staff or from a HUD -approved counseling agency acting with 
the con sent of the Borrower.  
When HUD staff request information, the Lender must make available legible documents 
in the format (electronic or hard copy) requested within 24 hours of the request or as 
otherwise permitted by HUD.  
iv. Communication with Authorized Third Parties

Authorized Third Parties  are parties who are not Borrowers on the Loan but who are 
authorized to communicate with Lenders regarding a Loan.  
(B) Standard  
The Lender must comply with all laws, rules, and requirements applicable to third -
party access to loan information, including any requirement to provide loan 
information and arrange for individual consultation to parties authorized by the 
Borrowers.  
(C) Required Documentation  
If communicating with an Authorized Third Party , the Lender must include 
documentation of the authorization in the servicing binder.  
v. Prepayment

is paid in full.  
(D) Recording Fees for Satisfactions  
The Lender may charge the Borrower a reasonable and customary fee for recording 
satisfactions in states where recordation is not the responsibility of the Lender.  
vi. Insurance Coverage Administration  
(A) Hazard Insurance  
Lenders may require the Borrower to have hazard insurance. If the Lender requires 
the Borrower to purchase hazard insurance, the Lender must:  
• be named as a “Loss Payee” on the hazard insurance policy; and  
• escrow sufficient funds for payment of the renewal premium.  
(B) Flood Insurance  
(1) Standard  
Flood insurance is required for a secured Loan when the Property is located in  an 
SFHA . 
Flood insurance must be obtained at any time during the term of the Loan when 
the Lender determines the secured Property is located in an SFHA . 
The Lender must ensure that insurance is in force for the life of the Loan or so 
long as such coverage remains available, unless the area in which the Property is 
located is no longer designated as an SFHA . If, due to rezoning, a Property 
securing an FHA -insured Loan becomes located in an SFHA, the Lender must 
enforce HUD’s flood insurance requirements on coverage amounts and 
maintenance.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 If the Borrower does not maintain flood insurance as required, the Lender must 
force place the insurance and may pass on the expense to the Borrower. However, 
the cost of such insurance may not be included in the calculation of HUD’s claim 
payment.  
When a Lender obtains title  to a home through repossession, the Lender may 
obtain and maintain flood insurance if the Property is or will be located in an 
SFHA  identified by FEMA until the sale or disposition of the home.  
The amount of flood insurance must be no less than the unpaid balance due on the 
Title  I Loan. The Title I Lender  must be named as a loss payee.  
(2) Required Documentation  
The Lender must include in the case binder  a copy of the insurance policy 
showing the amount of coverage and name of the loss payee.  
(C) Hazard or Flood Insurance  Proceeds  
Insurance Claims  
The Lender must take necessary steps to ensure that hazard or flood insurance claims 
are filed and settled as expeditiously as possible.  
vii. Annual Insurance Premium and Billing and Remittance  
(A) Definition  
Annual Insurance Premiums are charges that are remitted to HUD each year of the 
loan term.  
Loan Term, for the purposes of Title  I insurance, refers to the term of the insurance 
coverage, which extends from the Loan’s Disbursement  to maturity.  
(B) Standard  
The Lender must pay an insurance premium equal to 1 percent of the loan amount, 
multiplied by the number of years of the loan term. The 1 percent premium is 
calculated on the original loan amount rather than the declining loan amount.  
All insurance charges are considered earned when paid.  
(C) Billing Insurance Premium  
HUD will issue a billing statement each month to the Lender through FHAC. The 
billing statement will show the total amount due to HUD for that period.

III. SERVICING AND LOSS MITIGATION  
C. Title I Insured Programs  
1. Title I Property Improvement Loan Program  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1535  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (1) Billing Schedule  
HUD bills a Lender for the initial installment of the insurance charge on the next 
monthly billing statement after a Lender reports the Loan for insurance.  
If the loan term is 25 months or less, the Lender will receive one billing statement 
that reflects the entire insurance charge. For all other loan terms, the initial billing 
statement will reflect the annual premium for the year, plus any applicable penalt y 
or interest for late premium payments.  
HUD bills a Lender for the remaining premium installments annually. This billing 
occurs during the month of the loan disbursement anniversary.  
The final annual installment may be adjusted to reconcile with the total insurance 
charge due.  
A premium is not required and HUD will not bill for a period of 14 Days or less 
after acknowledgement of the loan report in FHAC. A charge for a full month is 
assessed for a period of more than 14 Days.  
If the loan term includes a partial year (e.g., 12 years and 6 months), the annual 
premium charge for the final partial year is pro -rated based on the number of 
months remaining (e.g., 0.5 percent for six months). HUD will include the pro -
rated annual premium charge for the final partial year with the premium charge 
billed for the final full year, if the partial year is less than 7 months.  
(2) Late Reporting  
A Loan that is submitted for insurance after the first anniversary of the 
Disbursement  Date  will not be insured until all past due annual premium charges 
are paid.  
(D) Premium Adjustment on Notes Transferred  
When Loans are transferred between Lenders and the premium charges on the Loans 
transferred are already paid, any adjustments related to these charges are to be made 
between the Lenders, with no involvement by HUD. HUD will bill the purchasing 
Lender for a ny unpaid insurance charges after being properly notified of the transfer 
through the submission of form HUD -27030 . 
(E) Remittance of Annual Insurance Premium  
Lenders must remit the annual insurance premium electronically through Pay.gov . 
Instructions for accessing Pay.gov can be found in the Title  I User Guide, which can 
be accessed from FHAC  under Property Improvement/Manufactured Home .

1. Title I Property Improvement Loan Program  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1536  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 The first annual premium payment due will be reflected on the billing statement 
issued the month after the Lender reports the Loan for insurance in FHAC.  
(F) Loan Terms Less than or Equal to 25 Months  
If a loan term is 25 months or less, the Lender will receive only one billing statement 
that reflects the entire insurance charge. Lenders must pay the entire insurance charge 
reflected on the billing statement no later than the 25th Day after the date of the 
billing statement.  
(G) Loan Terms Greater than 25 Months  
For loan terms greater than 25 months, the following must occur:  
• The first billing statement must reflect the initial annual installment due.  
• The insurance premium must be paid in annual installments.  
• Payments must be paid by the due date reflected on the billing statement.  
• Annual installments are due on the 25th Day after the date of billing by HUD.  
• Second and successive installments are due annually.  
Lenders must remit the loan insurance premium electronically through Pay.gov . 
(H) Penalty Charge and Interest on Late Premium Payments  
Insurance premiums not received from the Lender by the due date will be assessed a 
penalty charge of 4 percent of the amount of the payment.  
Insurance premiums received from the Lender more than 30 Days after the due date 
will also be assessed daily interest at the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate . 
However, no penalty charge or daily interest will be assessed if HUD fails to 
acknowledge receipt of the loan report or fails to bill the Lender for the insurance 
charges.  
(I) Refund or Abatement of Insurance Charges  
HUD does not grant any request for an insurance premium refund or abatement for 
the following reasons:  
• The Lender has exhausted its insurance reserve account or is no longer 
participating in the Title  I program.  
• The loan reporting occurs after the Loan is paid in full by the Borrower.  
• HUD determines that there was fraud or misrepresentation by a Lender in the 
loan transaction.  
Exceptions  
A refund or abatement of insurance charges is permitted only when the following 
events occur:

Handbook 4000.1   1537  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 • If the loan obligation is refinanced into another Title  I Loan, HUD will prorate 
any paid annual installments between the old Loan and the new Loan. HUD 
will use the date of the refinance to determine the amount pro -rated.  
• If the loan obligation is prepaid in full, charged off in accordance with IRS 
regulations, or Defaulted with an insurance claim, HUD does not bill for 
annual installments after a Lender informs HUD of these events. There will be 
no partial refund of insura nce charges already paid for that portion of the year 
occurring after the reporting of such events.  
• If a Loan or portion thereof is ineligible for insurance from its inception due to 
statutory violations, HUD refunds any insurance charges that have been paid 
on the ineligible portion. HUD refunds the insurance charges only if HUD 
denies an insurance clai m based upon this ineligibility, or if a Lender reports 
the ineligibility promptly upon discovery and HUD confirms the ineligibility.  
If an insurance claim is denied due to ineligibility and a Lender subsequently 
resubmits the claim with information showing that it was in fact eligible, any 
refunded amount of the insurance premium plus any accrued insurance charges must 
be paid by the Le nder.  
(J) Lender Review of Premium Charges  
The Lender is responsible for reviewing each Title  I billing statement to be sure that 
the amount billed is correct. Since each billing statement reflects the current status of 
Loans as indicated in HUD’s records, a billing statement could include annual 
premium charges for Loans where the charge is no lo nger due. Examples include 
Loans that were prepaid in full during the preceding year and Loans where the Lender 
has submitted an insurance claim to HUD, but the claim is not yet noted in HUD’s 
records.  
(1) Reconciling the Billing Statement  
The Lender is responsible for reconciling the billing statement with the Lender’s 
records to ensure that the billed amount and the loan activity reflected on the 
statement are accurate. The Lender should check each billing entry to confirm the 
Loan’s statu s. If a Loan is no longer active, the Lender may withhold payment 
(take an “exception”) for the premium charge billed for that Loan. The Lender 
must provide HUD with data on premium charges withheld when processing 
payment to HUD.  
(2) Exception Reporting  
The billing statement provided in FHAC allows Lenders to take “exceptions” on 
Loans where they believe they no longer owe premiums (prepaid, claim 
submitted, other, etc.).

supporting documentation if deemed necessary to verify the validity of an 
exception. HUD will update its records as appropriate, including termination of

c. Assumptions  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Conditions for an Assumption  
At the option of the Lender, an existing Title  I Loan may be assumed, subject to the 
following conditions:  
• a determination by the Lender that the assumptor is eligible;  
• a determination by the Lender that the assumptor is an acceptable credit risk 
based on HUD’s underwriting requirements;  
• the execution of an assumption agreement that is satisfactory to the Lender and is 
signed by the assumptor and the original Borrower(s) or previous assumptor(s) at 
the time of assumption. This agreement must obligate the assumptor for 
repayment of the Loan  so that the original Note is valid and legally enforceable 
against the assumptor; and  
• prior to execution of the assumption agreement, the Lender must provide the 
assumptor with a Notice to Borrower of HUD’s Role  and obtain the assumptor’s 
acknowledgement.  
The Loan to be assumed may be Delinquent . The security may be transferred to a new 
eligible  Borrower.  
ii. Release of Liability  
If the conditions above are met, the Lender at its option may release the original 
Borrower(s) and any intervening assumptor(s) from liability for repayment of the Title  I 
Loan. Approval from HUD is not required. The Lender must retain documentation of the 
release in the case binder . 
iii. No Release of Liability  
If a Lender opts not to release the original Borrower(s) and intervening assumptor(s), the 
Lender must comply with all the servicing requirements as they pertain to the previous 
Borrowers/assumptors as well as with the current Borrower/assumptor. In partic ular, the 
Lender must mail the Notice of Default and Acceleration to previous 
Borrowers/assumptors. If a Lender does not formally release the original 
Borrowers/assumptors at the time of the assumption then the Lender must use caution not 
to inadvertently release them during the servicing and liquidation of the Loan. The 
requirement that the Lender maintains and assigns to HUD a legally enforceable Note 
pertains to any Borrower who was not officially released from liability.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 iv. Assumption Fee  
The Lender may charge up to 1 percent of the unpaid principal balance as a fee for 
approving the assumptor and preparing the assumption agreement.  
v. Reporting an Assumption to HUD  
Lenders must report the assumption to the FOC  in order to have the current Borrower’s 
name reflected on future insurance charge billing statements. When reporting an 
assumption, the Lender must supply the FHA case number, the name of the original 
Borrower and the name(s) and Social Security Number(s)  (SSN) of the assumptor(s).  
d. Modification of a Current Loan  (05/09/2022 ) 
A Lender may enter into a modification agreement with a Borrower without prior permission 
from HUD on a Loan that is current. A modification agreement:  
• requires a written agreement signed by the Borrower;  
• need not be recorded;  
• may only decrease the interest rate;  
• must not advance new funds; and  
• does not require any further insurance reporting to HUD, but all documentation of the 
modification must be submitted if an insurance claim is filed.  
e. Loan Default and Loss Mitigation  (05/09/2022 ) 
As part of prudent and diligent loan servicing, HUD encourages Lenders to make a 
reasonable effort to assist delinquent Borrowers in bringing the Loan current prior to 
accelerating the Loan. For any loss mitigation strategy implemented, the Lender must 
determine that the Borrower is reasonably able to repay past arrearages and qualify based on 
the Approvable Qualifying Ratio . 
i. Contact with the Borrower  
Before taking action to accelerate the maturity of the Loan, the Lender or its agent must 
contact the Borrower and any co -maker or Co -signer , either in a face -to-face meeting or 
by telephone, to discuss the reasons for the Default and to seek its cure. If the Borrower 
and the co -makers or Co -signers cannot be located, will not discuss the Default, or will 
not agree to its cure, the Lender may proceed to take action. The Lender must document 
the results of its efforts to contact the Borrower and any co -maker or Co -signer.  
ii. Loss Mitigation Tools  
HUD encourages loss mitigation to help a delinquent Borrower return the Loan to good 
standing. The purpose of loss mitigation is to reduce HUD and Lender losses, and 
preserve insurance reserves. Listed below are the tools available to Lenders and 
Borrowers  that can assist in bringing the Loan current.

Handbook 4000.1   1540  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (A) Refinance  
A Loan that is in Default may be refinanced . There can be no “cash out” to the 
Borrower. The principal amount of the new Loan may not exceed the lesser of: 1) the 
cost to the Borrower of prepaying the existing Loan or 2) the original principal 
balance of the original Loan being refinanced.  
(B) Modification Agreement  
The Borrower may be considered for a Loan Modification  if the Borrower has 
recently experienced an involuntary reduction in income or an unexpected increase in 
living expenses, and the Lender determines the Borrower has a reasonable ability to 
pay under the terms of the loan modification plan to eliminate the  arrearage. A 
Lender may enter into a modification agreement with a Borrower without prior 
permission from HUD. A modification agreement:  
• requires a written agreement signed by the Borrower;  
• need not be recorded;  
• may increase or decrease the monthly payment amount;  
• cannot increase the interest rate or loan term;  
• cannot include new funds; and  
• does not require any further insurance reporting to HUD, but all 
documentation of the modification must be submitted if an insurance claim is 
filed.  
(C) Repayment Plan  
A repayment plan does not require a Borrower’s signed agreement. A Borrower may 
be eligible for a repayment plan if the Borrower has recently experienced an 
involuntary reduction in income or an unexpected increase in living expenses, and the 
Lender determ ines the Borrower has a reasonable ability to pay under the terms of the 
repayment plan. A Lender may enter into a repayment plan without HUD’s 
permission.  
A repayment plan:  
• must be evidenced by a copy of the Lender’s letter to the Borrower outlining 
the terms of the agreement;  
• cannot extend beyond six months; and  
• does not require any further insurance reporting to HUD.  
(D) Partial Payments  
(1) Definition  
A Partial Payment refers to a payment of any amount less than the full amount 
due on the Loan at the time the payment is tendered, including Late Charge s and

C. Title I Insured Programs  
1. Title I Property Improvement Loan Program  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1541  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 amounts advanced by the Lender on behalf of the Borrower (such as for the 
payment of taxes).  
(2) Standard  
The Lender may agree to accept a Partial Payment, thereby assisting a Borrower 
who is having a temporary problem making their Loan Payment . This practice 
will usually be advantageous for the Lender and HUD.  
Except as outlined below, a Lender must accept any Partial Payment and apply it 
to the Borrower’s account or hold it in a trust account pending disposition. When 
Partial Payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, they 
must be appli ed to the Borrower’s account, thus advancing the date of the oldest 
unpaid installment.  
If the Lender did not agree to accept Partial Payments, it must return a Partial 
Payment to the Borrower with a letter of explanation if any of the following 
apply:  
• The Loan is not in Default.  
• The payment represents less than half of the full amount then due.  
• The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a modification 
agreement or repayment plan.  
• The Lender has issued a Notice of Default and Acceleration.  
• The Loan has been Delinquent  for six months.  
• The Loan has been chronically Delinquent  (i.e. two or more instances 
where the account was Delinquent, brought current, and then reverted 
back to a Delinquent status).  
(E) Assumption  
If a Borrower cannot afford to continue to make Loan Payment s and elects to sell the 
Property, the Lender may approve an assumption  of the Loan.  
iii. Notice of Default and Acceleration  
The Lender must provide each Borrower with written notice that the Loan is in Default 
and that the loan maturity is to be accelerated. This notice must be sent when the Loan is 
at least 30 Days Delinquent  but after the Lender has attempted to contact the Borrower . 
Exceptions to sending the notice include when the Borrower cures the Default, agrees to 
a modification agreement or repayment plan, or is in bankruptcy . The notice must be in a 
font size no smaller than the equivalent of Times New Roman Size 12 for the entire 
notice.  
In addition to complying with applicable state or local notice requirements, the notice 
must be sent by certified mail and must contain:

unpaid principal and earned interest on the Note as of the date 30 Days from the 
date of the notice;  
• a demand upon the Borrower either to cure the Default (by bringing the Loan 
current or by refinancing the Loan) or to agree to a modification agreement or a 
repayment plan, no later than the date 30 Days from the date of the notice;  
• a statement that if the Borrower fails either to cure the Default or to agree to a 
modification agreement or a repayment plan by the date accruing 30 Days from 
the date of the notice, then, as of the date 30 Days from the date of the notice, the 
maturity o f the Loan is accelerated and full payment of all amounts due under the 
Loan is required; and  
• a statement that if the Default persists the Lender will report the Default to an 
appropriate credit reporting agency:  
This Loan is insured against nonpayment by the federal government. If you do 
not repay the Loan as agreed, we may assign the debt to the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for collection. If your Loan is 
assigned to HUD, your failure to  pay the debt in accordance with the terms 
set by HUD may result in any or all of the following actions:  
• seizing your federal income tax refunds, Social Security benefit 
payments, federal employee wages or retirement, or other federal 
payments;  
• administrative garnishment of your wages if you are not a federal 
employee (which does not require a judgment and court order to 
implement);  
• referring the debt to the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department 
of the Treasury, or to private collection agencies; and  
• making you liable for penalties and administrative costs that HUD 
may impose as authorized by Section 3717 to Title  31 of the United 
States Code (including collection fees charged by the Department of 
Justice, Department of Treasury or private collection agencies).  
iv. Notice to Credit Reporting Agency  
If the loan maturity is accelerated and the Loan is not reinstated, the Lender must report 
the Default to an appropriate credit reporting agency.  
v. Reinstatement of the Loan

Lender must take prompt, effective action to protect the Lender’s interest as holder of the 
Loan.  
(A) Bankruptcy  
The Lender must file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy  court, unless the court 
notifies the Lender that the Borrower has no assets. A proof of claim must be filed 
even if the Borrower is current on the Title  I Loan. The Lender must verify that the 
proof of claim is filed, on time and without objection, and takes any other steps 
necessary to protect the Lender’s interest as holder of the Note.  
If the bankruptcy  is closed, the Lender must have evidence of the bankruptcy 
discharge or dismissal.  
Documentation of these steps can be in the form of notices from the bankruptcy  court, 
or other official records such as the Public Access to Court Electronic Records 
(PACER).  
(B) Deceased Borrower  
The Lender must confirm the death of a Borrower via a death certificate or other 
reasonable evidence. The Lender must determine if a probate proceeding exists and

Handbook 4000.1   1544  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (1) Release of Lien for Short Sale

are insufficient to pay all liens in full, the documentation must include:  
• copies of the contract of sale;  
• an appraisal showing the value of the Property;  
• the Title  Report for the Property; and  
• the proposed Settlement Statement or similar legal document showing 
how the proceeds will be distributed.  
The lien securing the Title  I Loan should be treated equitably and the sale must 
provide for a payment that will result in a significant principal reduction to the 
Title I Loan. The Title I Loan may be in Default, but the delinquency must not 
exceed four payments and the payment fro m the Short Sale  must be sufficient to 
bring the Loan current as well as make a principal reduction.  
Unless HUD also approves a release of liability  or a Borrower is discharged in 
bankruptcy , the Note must remain valid and enforceable against all Borrowers. To 
avoid any confusion or misunderstanding, the Lender must obtain an affidavit 
from the Borrower(s) that reaffirms their obligation to repay the remaining 
portion of the Title  I Loan. The Lender must be careful to prevent an 
unintentional release of liability while processing the release of lien. “Paid in 
Full,” “Satisfied in Full,” or similar text must not be indicated on the release 
document, on the promissory note, or in oth er correspondence from the Lender 
regarding the release of lien.  
(2) Partial Release  of Security  
In the case of a partial release  of security, the documentation must include:  
• a legal description of the Property to be released;  
• an appraisal showing the value of the Property to be released and of the 
Property that will continue to secure the lien; and  
• information on the consideration received and how the funds will be 
distributed.

reduced in value. The security value provided by the proposed substitution Property 
must equal or exceed the value of the existing security.

Unless the Loan meets the exception requirements in Cash -Out When 
Refinancing a Senior Loan , the Borrower must receive a benefit from a

If the new refinanced mortgage results in cash -out that will be:  
• applied to the principal balance of a delinquent Title  I Loan that is not 
more than six months delinquent; or  
• used to pay off another lien, which would raise the Title  I Loan to a 
second position;  
then, the standards for Borrower Benefit  and New First Trust Mortgage 
Amount  are not required.  
The Lender must not subordinate the Title  I security for a refinance that 
includes cash -out for payment of other obligations, including, but not limited 
to: 
• unsecured  debt;  
• loans secured by collateral other than the subject Property;  
• loans in junior lien position to the Title  I Loan; or

Title I FHA -approved Lender.  
(B) Standard  
A Lender may sell, assign, or transfer its Title  I Loans, but only to a Lender that has 
been approved by HUD to participate in the Title I program and has an active Title I 
contract number.  
The selling Lender relinquishes all rights and obligations under the contract for loan 
insurance on the effective date of the sale. The selling Lender remains responsible for

Transfers of Loans for Title  I Property Improvement Loans must be submitted 
separately from Manufactured Home  Loans. The two insurance types cannot be 
submitted on the same form HUD -27030. The Lender must complete a separate form 
HUD -27030 for each insurance type being reported.  
If a large number of Loans are being transferred, a completed form HUD -27030 may 
be submitted with an attached report or electronic file attachment (such as Excel 
spreadsheet) that provides the loan level data required by the form.  
HUD will hold the selling Lender responsible for all related premium charges and 
will disburse claim payments only to the selling Lender until an appropriately 
prepared form HUD -27030 is received and processed.  
(D) Earmarking Reserves  
HUD may transfer a Loan or group of Loans with earmarking which keeps the 
insurance coverage separate from other loans owned by the purchasing Lender. In 
other words, the insurance coverage reserves associated with the Loans being 
transferred remain in a s eparate account from any loans already held by the purchaser. 
Once a Loan is earmarked it remains earmarked even if it is subsequently transferred 
to another Lender.  
ii. Providing Information to HUD  
The Lender must respond to verbal or written requests for individual account 
information, including all servicing information and related data and the entire loan

(C) Trustee ’s Fee for Satisfactions  
If specifically provided for in the security instrument, the Lender may charge the 
Borrower the amount of the trustee’s fee, plus any reasonable and customary fees for

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 payment, or for the execution of a satisfaction, release , or trustee ’s deed when the 
debt is paid in full.  
(D) Recording Fees for Satisfactions  
The Lender may charge the Borrower a reasonable and customary fee for recording 
satisfactions in states where recordation is not the responsibility of the Lender.  
v. Insurance Coverage Administration  
(A) Hazard Insurance  
Hazard insurance is required for all Manufactured Home  Loans. The amount of 
insurance must be no less than the unpaid balance due on the Title  I Loan, or no less 
than the actual value of the home where state law precludes a higher amount. The 
Lender must be named as the loss payee.  
If a Borrower does not maintain the required hazard insurance, the Lender must 
obtain the insurance and may pass on the expense to the Borrower. However, the cost 
of such insurance may not be included in the calculation of HUD’s claim payment . 
When a Lender obtains title  to the home through repossession, the Lender must 
purchase and maintain sufficient hazard insurance until the sale or final disposition of 
the home. The cost of such insurance may be included in the calculation of HUD’s 
claim payment.  
The Lender assumes the risk for loss of insurance benefits for noncompliance with 
hazard requirements.  
(B) Flood Insurance  
(1) Standard  
Flood insurance is required if the home site is located in a Special Flood Hazard 
Area  (SFHA) identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA).  
Flood insurance must be obtained at any time during the term of the Loan when 
the Lender determines the secured Property is located in an SFHA . 
The Lender must ensure that insurance is in force for the life of the Loan or so 
long as such coverage remains available, unless the area in which the Property is 
located is no longer designated as an SFHA . If, due to rezoning, a Property 
securing an FHA -insured Loan becomes located in an SFHA, the Lender must 
enforce HUD’s flood insurance requirements on coverage amounts and 
maintenance.

Handbook 4000.1   1552  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 If the Borrower does not maintain flood insurance as required, the Lender must 
force place the insurance and may pass on the expense to the Borrower. However, 
the cost of such insurance may not be included in the calculation of HUD’s claim 
payment.  
When a Lender obtains title  to a home through repossession, the Lender may 
obtain and maintain flood insurance if the Property is or will be located in an 
SFHA  identified by FEMA until the sale or disposition of the home.  
The amount of flood insurance must be no less than the unpaid balance due on the 
Title  I Loan. The Title I Lender  must be named as a loss payee.  
If the Lender fails to obtain the required flood insurance and an uninsured home is 
damaged, HUD will adjust its claim payment.  
When a Manufactured Home  is without flood insurance and has sustained, at any 
time prior to the sale or disposition of the home, damage that would normally be 
covered by such insurance, the appraised value for claim calculation purposes will 
be based on the retail value of compar able homes in undamaged condition without 
any deduction for such damage.  
The cost of such insurance may be included in the calculation of HUD’s claim 
payment . 
(2) Required Documentation  
The Lender must include in the case binder  a copy of the insurance policy 
showing the amount of coverage and name of the loss payee.  
(C) Hazard or Flood Insurance  Claims  
The Lender must take necessary steps to ensure that hazard or flood insurance claims 
are filed and settled as expeditiously as possible.  
vi. Annual Insurance Premium and Billing and Remittance  
(A) Definition  
Annual Insurance Premiums are charges that are remitted to HUD each year of the 
loan term.  
Loan Term, for the purposes of Title  I insurance, refers to the term of the insurance 
coverage, which extends from the Loan’s Disbursement  to maturity.  
(B) Standard  
The Lender must pay an insurance premium equal to 1 percent of the remaining 
principal balance, based upon the Loan’s scheduled amortization. The annual 

--- PAGE 1578 ---

C. Title I Insured Programs  
2. Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1553  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 premium charge must be paid for the full term of the Loan unless the Loan is prepaid 
in full or a claim is submitted to HUD.  
All insurance charges are considered earned when paid.  
(C) Billing Annual Insurance Premium  
HUD will issue a billing statement each month to the Lender through FHAC. The 
billing statement will show the total amount due to HUD for that period.  
The billing statement will differentiate Loans originated under the FHA 
Manufactured Housing  Loan Modernization Act of 2008 from Property Improvement 
and/or Manufactured Home Loans originated under the portfolio loan insurance 
program and are still covered by the Lender’s insurance reserve account.  
(1) Billing Schedule  
HUD bills the Lender for the initial installment of the insurance charge on the 
monthly statement at the beginning of the second year of the Loan. The charge 
will appear on the billing statement for the monthly billing cycle that corresponds 
to the anniver sary of the Loan’s Disbursement  Date . 
HUD bills a Lender for the remaining premium installments annually. This billing 
occurs during the month of the loan disbursement anniversary.  
If the loan term includes a partial year (e.g., 12 years and 6 months), the annual 
premium charge for the final partial year is pro -rated based on the number of 
months remaining (e.g., 0.5 percent for six months). HUD will include the pro -
rated annual premium charge for the final partial year with the premium charge 
billed for the final full year, if the partial year is less than 7 months.  
This may vary from the number of Borrower payments required to repay the 
Loan. The loan term varies based on the time between the Disbursement  Date  and 
the date of the first payment. When calculating the loan term, HUD does not 
count partial months of 14 Days or less. HUD counts as a full month any partial 
month that is more than 14 Days.  
(2) Late Endorsement Reporting  
A Loan that is reported for endorsement after the first anniversary of the 
Disbursement  Date  will not be endorsed until the upfront premium and all past 
due annual premium charges are paid. The Lender must contact the FOC to 
confirm the amount due and to make arrangements for payment.

2. Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1554  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (D) Premium Adjustment on Notes Transferred  
When Loans are transferred between Lenders and the premium charges on the Loans 
transferred are already paid, any adjustments related to these charges are to be made 
between the Lenders, with no involvement by HUD. HUD will bill the purchasing 
Lender for a ny unpaid insurance charges, after being notified of the transfer in 
compliance with requirements for a Title  I Loan Sale . 
The Lender or subsequent owner of the Loan is responsible for the payment of all 
premium charges. If the Lender uses a servicing agent to handle this function, HUD 
can establish billing for the agent on behalf of the Lender.  
(E) Remittance of Annual Insurance Premium  
Lenders must remit the annual insurance premium electronically through Pay.gov . 
Instructions for accessing Pay.gov can be found in the Title  I User Guide, which can 
be accessed from FHAC  under Property Improvement/Manufactured Home . 
The Lender must remit its annual premium payment within 25 Days from the date of 
each billing statement. The billing statement will specify the payment due date.  
(F) Penalty Charge and Interest on Late Premium Payment  
Lenders must pay the insurance premium reflected on their bill on or before the listed 
Payment Due Date.  
The Lender is assessed a penalty charge of 4 percent of the amount of any premium 
payment not received by HUD by the due date.  
Premium payments received from a Lender more than 30 Days after the due date are 
also assessed daily interest at the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate . However, a 
Lender is not required to pay a penalty charge or daily interest if HUD fails to issue a 
billing statement for annual premium charges in a timely manner.  
HUD may accept a late report on a Loan where the Lender certifies that the obligation 
is not in Default.  
(G) Refund or Abatement of Insurance Charges  
HUD does not grant any request for an insurance premium refund or abatement for 
the following reasons:  
• The Lender has exhausted its insurance reserve account or is no longer 
participating in the Title  I program.  
• The loan reporting occurs after the Loan is paid in full by the Borrower.  
• HUD determines that there was fraud or misrepresentation by a Lender in the 
loan transaction.

C. Title I Insured Programs  
2. Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1555  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 Exception  
A refund or abatement of insurance charges is permitted only when the following 
events occur:  
• If the loan obligation is refinanced into another Title  I Loan, HUD will prorate 
any paid annual installments between the old Loan and the new Loan. HUD 
will use the date of the refinance to determine the amount pro -rated.  
• If the loan obligation is prepaid in full, charged off in accordance with IRS 
regulations, or Defaulted with an insurance claim, HUD does not bill for 
annual installments after a Lender informs HUD of these events. There will be 
no partial refund of insura nce charges already paid for that portion of the year 
occurring after the reporting of such events.  
• If a Loan, or portion thereof, is ineligible for insurance from its inception due 
to statutory violations, HUD refunds any insurance charges that have been 
paid on the ineligible portion. HUD refunds the insurance charges only if 
HUD denies an insurance cl aim based upon this ineligibility, or if a Lender 
reports the ineligibility promptly upon discovery and HUD confirms the 
ineligibility.  
If an insurance claim is denied due to ineligibility and a Lender subsequently 
resubmits the claim with information showing that it was in fact eligible, any 
refunded amount of the insurance premium plus any accrued insurance charges must 
be paid by the Le nder.  
(H) Lender Review of Premium Charges  
The Lender is responsible for reviewing each Title  I billing statement to be sure that 
the amount billed is correct. Since each billing statement reflects the current status of 
Loans as indicated in HUD’s records, a billing statement could include annual 
premium charges for Loans where the premium is no l onger due. No premium is due 
for Loans that were prepaid in full during the preceding year and Loans where the 
Lender has submitted an insurance claim to HUD, but the claim is not yet noted in 
HUD’s records.  
(1) Reconciling the Billing Statement  
The Lender is responsible for reconciling the billing statement with the Lender’s 
records to ensure that the billed amount and the loan activity reflected on the 
statement are accurate. The Lender should check each billing entry to confirm the 
Loan’s statu s. 
(2) Exception Reporting  
The billing statement provided in FHAC allows Lenders to take “exceptions” on 
Loans where they believe they no longer owe premiums (prepaid, claim 
submitted, other, etc.).

Handbook 4000.1   1556  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 If a Loan is no longer active, the Lender may withhold payment (take an 
“exception”) for the premium charge billed for that Loan. The Lender must report 
the applicable exception reason for withholding the payment in FHAC.  
(3) Exception Reviews  
HUD reviews reported exceptions and may request the Lender to supply 
supporting documentation if deemed necessary to verify the validity of an 
exception. HUD will update its records as appropriate, including termination of 
insurance coverage where warrante d. HUD will re -bill the Lender for the 
premium charge if the exception is determined to be invalid.  
vii. Reporting Non -compliant Activities  
If the Lender discovers fraud, misrepresentation, or substantial noncompliance with 
program requirements, the Lender must promptly submit a report to HUD.  
Examples of non -compliant activities that must be reported include:  
• misstatement of fact(s) on the credit application;  
• falsified documentation;  
• false certifications from Borrowers, Dealers or inspection companies;  
• Dealer’s failure to submit an executed form HUD -56002 -MH, Placement 
Certificate for Manufactured Home ; 
• Dealer’s failure to comply with contractual obligations to the Borrower;  
• dealer referral fee or any like charges paid;  
• inaccurate or deceptive advertising and/or marketing material; and  
• manufacturer’s refusal to honor its warranty.  
The Lender must prepare a report of noncompliance on the Lender’s letterhead. The 
report must detail the non -compliant activity and must contain the following information 
to assist in any investigation: borrower name, borrower address, borrower telephone 
number, loan amount, loan date, inspection date, lender loan number, Title  I loan number, 
loan officer name, dealer name, dealer address, dealer telephone number, and dealer tax 
identification number.  
The report must be sent to:  
Housing Office of Lender Activities and Program Compliance  
Attn: Director, Quality Assurance Division  
Department of Housing and Urban Development  
451 7th Street, S.W.  
Washington, DC 20410  
If the Loan has been endorsed for insurance by HUD, the insurance on the Loan will stay 
in effect. If the non -compliant activity was caused or sanctioned by an employee of a

impose other sanctions against the Lender.  
c. Assumptions  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Conditions  
At the option of the Lender, an existing Title  I Loan may be assumed, subject to the 
following conditions:  
• a determination by the Lender that the assumptor is eligible ; 
• a determination by the Lender that the assumptor is an acceptable credit risk 
based on HUD’s underwriting requirements;  
• the execution of an assumption agreement that is satisfactory to the Lender and is 
signed by the assumptor and the original Borrower(s) or previous assumptor(s) at 
the time of assumption. This agreement must obligate the assumptor for 
repayment of the Loan so that the original Note is valid and legally enforceable 
against the assumptor; and  
• prior to execution of the assumption agreement, the Lender must provide the 
assumptor with a Notice to Borrower of HUD’s Role  and obtain the assumptor’s 
acknowledgement.  
ii. Release of Liability  
If the conditions above are met, the Lender, at its option, may release the original 
Borrower(s) and any intervening assumptor(s) from liability for repayment of the Title  I 
Loan. Approval from HUD is not required. The Lender must retain documentation of the 
release in the case binder . 
A Lender must not release the Borrower or any co -maker or Co -signer  from liability 
under the Note without prior approval from HUD. An exception may be possible if there 
is an assumption.  
iii. No Release of Liability  
If a Lender opts not to release the original Borrower(s) and intervening assumptor(s), the 
Lender must comply with the servicing requirements outlined in this section as they 
pertain to the previous Borrowers/assumptors as well as with the current 
Borrower /assumptor. In particular, the Lender must mail the Notice of Default and 
Acceleration to previous Borrowers/assumptors and repossess/foreclose against the 
security in such a way as to preserve the legal liability of the previous 
Borrowers/assumptors.  
If the Lender does not formally release the original Borrowers/assumptors at the time of 
the assumption, then the Lender must use caution not to inadvertently release them during 
the servicing and liquidation of the Loan. The requirement that the Lender ma intains and 
assigns to HUD a legally enforceable Note pertains to any Borrower who was not 
officially released from liability.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 iv. Assumption Fee  
The Lender may charge up to 1 percent of the unpaid principal balance as a fee for 
approving the assumptor and preparing the assumption agreement.  
v. Reporting Assumptions  
The Lender must report assumptions  to HUD in order to have the current Borrower’s 
name reflected on future insurance charge billing statements. An assumption may be 
reported via mail, fax, or email to the FOC . When reporting an assumption, the Lender 
must supply the Title  I case number, the name of the original Borrower and the name(s) 
and Social Security Number(s) (SSN) of the assumptor(s).  
d. Modification of a Current Loan  (05/09/2022 ) 
A Lender may enter into a modification agreement with a Borrower without prior permission 
from HUD on a Loan that is current. A modification agreement:  
• requires a written agreement signed by the Borrower;  
• need not be recorded;  
• may only decrease the interest rate; 
• must not advance new funds; and  
• does not require any further insurance reporting to HUD, but all documentation of the 
modification must be submitted if an insurance claim is filed.  
e. Loan Default and Loss Mitigation  (05/09/2022 ) 
As part of prudent and diligent loan servicing, HUD encourages Lenders to make a 
reasonable effort to assist delinquent Borrowers in bringing the Loan current prior to 
accelerating the Loan and repossessing the Manufactured Home . 
i. Contact with the Borrower  
Within 17 Days of the missed payment, but before taking action to accelerate the 
maturity of the Loan, the Lender or its agent must contact the Borrower and any co -
maker or Co -signer , either in a face -to-face meeting or by telephone, to discuss the 
reasons for the Default and to seek its cure. If the Borrower and the co -makers or Co -
signers cannot be located, will not discuss the Default, or will not agree to its cure, the 
Lender may proceed to take action. The Lender must document the results of its efforts to 
contact the Borrower and any co -maker or Co -signer.  
ii. Loss Mitigation Tools  
HUD encourages loss mitigation to help a delinquent Borrower return the Loan to good 
standing. The purpose of loss mitigation is to assist the Borrower to retain the home, to 
reduce HUD and Lender losses, and to preserve the insurance fund. Listed below ar e the 
tools available to Lenders and Borrowers that can assist in bringing the Loan current.

Handbook 4000.1   1559  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (A) Refinance  
A Streamline Refinance  may be used for a Loan that is in Default provided that it is 
not refinanced for an amount greater than the lesser of:  
• the original principal balance of the Loan; or  
• the current principal balance plus reasonable closing cost s and Upfront 
Mortgage Insurance Premium  (UFMIP).  
(B) Modification Agreement  
A Borrower may be considered for a Loan Modification  if the Lender determines the 
Borrower has the reasonable ability to pay under the terms of the loan modification 
plan to eliminate the arrearage. A Lender may enter into a modification agreement 
with a Borrower without prior permission from HUD. A modific ation agreement:  
• requires a written agreement signed by the Borrower;  
• need not be recorded;  
• may increase or decrease the monthly payment amount;  
• cannot increase the interest rate or loan term;  
• cannot include new funds; and  
• does not require any further insurance reporting to HUD; however, all 
documentation concerning the modification must be submitted if an insurance 
claim is filed.  
(C) Repayment Plan  
Unlike a modification, a repayment plan does not require a Borrower’s signed 
agreement. As with a modification, a Borrower may be considered for a short 
repayment plan if the Borrower has recently experienced an involuntary reduction in 
income or an unexpe cted increase in living expenses and the Lender determines the 
Borrower has a reasonable ability to pay under the terms of the repayment plan. A 
Lender may enter into a repayment plan without HUD’s permission.  
A repayment plan:  
• must be evidenced by a copy of the Lender’s letter to the Borrower outlining 
the terms of the agreement;  
• may not extend beyond six months; and  
• does not require any further insurance reporting to HUD.  
When establishing and monitoring a repayment plan, the Lender must ensure that the 
status of the Loan will not preclude submission of a claim for loss to HUD due to 
exceeding the deadline for claim submission.

Handbook 4000.1   1560  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 (D) Partial Payments  
(1) Definition  
A Partial Payment refers to a payment of any amount less than the full amount 
due on the Loan at the time the payment is tendered, including Late Charge s and 
amounts advanced by the Lender on behalf of the Borrower (such as for the 
payment of taxes).  
(2) Standard  
The Lender may agree to accept a Partial Payment, thereby assisting a Borrower 
who is having a temporary problem making their Loan Payment . This practice 
will usually be advantageous for the Lender and HUD.  
Except as outlined below, a Lender must accept any Partial Payment and apply it 
to the Borrower’s account or hold it in a trust account pending disposition. When 
Partial Payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, they 
must be appli ed to the Borrower’s account, thus advancing the date of the oldest 
unpaid installment.  
If the Lender did not agree to accept Partial Payments, it must return a Partial 
Payment to the Borrower with a letter of explanation if any of the following 
apply:  
• The Loan is not in Default.  
• The payment represents less than half of the full amount then due.  
• The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a modification 
agreement or repayment plan.  
• The Lender has issued a Notice of Default and Acceleration.  
• The Loan has been Delinquent  for six months.  
• The Loan has been chronically Delinquent  (i.e., two or more instances 
where the account was Delinquent, brought current, and then reverted 
back to a Delinquent status).  
(E) Assumption  
If the Borrower cannot afford to continue to make Loan Payment s and elects to sell 
the home, the Lender may approve an assumption  of the Loan.  
(F) Short Sale  
The Lender may agree to release its lien on the home to facilitate the Borrower’s sale 
of the home to a third party for less than the amount due the Lender. The Lender may 
still file a claim with HUD regarding the resultant deficiency, provided that the ac tual 
sales price is not less than the value of the home as determined by a current HUD -
approved appraisal , and provided that the Borrower remains legally liable for the

Handbook 4000.1   1561  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 remaining amount owed on the Loan. A short sale  release of lien, with release of 
liability of the Borrower, requires prior approval from HUD.  
iii. Notice of Default and Acceleration  
The Lender must provide each Borrower with written notice that the Loan is in Default 
and that the loan maturity is to be accelerated. This notice must be sent when the Loan is 
at least 30 Days Delinquent  but after the Lender has attempted to contact the Borrower . 
Exceptions to sending the notice include when the Borrower agrees to a modification 
agreement or repayment plan, is in bankruptcy , or has voluntarily surrendered the 
Manufactured Home . 
In addition to complying with applicable state or local notice requirements, the notice 
must be no smaller than size 12 font Times New Roman, sent by certified mail, and 
contain:  
• a description of the obligation or security interest held by the Lender;  
• a statement of the nature of the Default and of the amount due to the Lender as 
unpaid principal and earned interest on the Note as of the date of the notice;  
• a demand upon the Borrower either to cure the Default or to agree to a 
modification agreement or a repayment plan, no later than 30 Days from the date 
of the notice;  
• a statement that upon the Borrower’s failure to comply with the demand, the 
maturity of the Loan is accelerated and full payment of all amounts due is then 
required;  
• a statement that if the Default persists the Lender will report the Default to an 
appropriate credit reporting agency; and  
• the following statement:  
This loan is insured against nonpayment by the federal government. If you do 
not repay the loan as agreed, we may assign the debt to the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for collection. If your loan is 
assigned to HUD, your failure to  pay the debt in accordance with the terms 
set by HUD may result in any or all of the following actions:  
• Seizing your federal income tax refunds, Social Security benefit 
payments, federal employee wages or retirement, or other federal 
payments,  
• Administrative garnishment of your wages if you are not a federal 
employee (which does not require a judgment and court order to 
implement),  
• Referring the debt to the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department 
of the Treasury, or to private collection agencies,  
• Your liability for penalties and administrative costs that HUD may 
impose as authorized by Section 3717 to Title  31 of the United States 
Code (including collection fees charged by Justice, Treasury or 
private collection agencies.)

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 iv. Notice to Credit Reporting Agency  
If the loan maturity is accelerated and the Loan is not reinstated, the Lender must report 
the Default to one or more of the national credit reporting agencies.  
v. Reinstatement of the Loan  
The Lender may rescind the acceleration of maturity and reinstate the Loan only if the 
Borrower brings the Loan current, executes a modification agreement, or agrees to an 
acceptable repayment plan.  
vi. Bankrupt or Deceased Borrower  
When a Lender becomes aware that a Borrower has filed bankruptcy  or has died, the 
Lender must take prompt, effective action to protect the Lender’s interest as holder of the 
Loan.  
(A) Bankruptcy  
(1) Standard  
The Lender must file a timely proof of claim with the bankruptcy  court, unless the 
court notifies the Lender that the Borrower has no assets. A proof of claim must 
be filed even if the Borrower is current on the Title  I Loan. Since the Lender must 
repossess and sell the Manufactured Home  prior to submitting a claim for loss 
with HUD, the Lender must take all steps necessary to preserve the lien against 
the home.  
If the bankruptcy  is closed, the Lender must have evidence of the bankruptcy 
discharge or dismissal.  
In a case where relief from the stay has been granted for the purpose of 
repossessing the home, the Lender must file a deficiency claim for the unsecured  
balance no later than 180 Days following filing of the petition to ensure their 
deficiency claim is not barred.  
(2) Required Documentation  
The case binder  must contain evidence of bankruptcy  discharge or dismissal.  
(B) Deceased Borrower  
The Lender must confirm the death of a Borrower via a death certificate or other 
reasonable evidence. The Lender must determine if a probate proceeding exists and 
document its findings. If there is a probate proceeding, the Lender must file a timely 
proof of claim.

Servicing of Manufactured Home  Lot Loan s and Combination Loan s are subject to the 
requirements for servicing Manufactured Home Loans  with the following exceptions.  
Upon acceleration of the maturity on a Defaulted Manufactured Home  Lot Loan  or 
Combination Loan , the Lender must proceed against the loan security by foreclosure  for 
Property classified as real estate (i.e., the lot, and if applicable, the Manufactured Home), and 
repossess any Manufactured Home classified as Personal Property . 
Once the Lender obtains the Property through foreclosure  and/or repossession if applicable, 
the Manufactured Home  and lot securing a Combination Loan  may be sold in a single 
transaction or separately, without prior approval from HUD.  
Claim Submission and Payment  
Claim submission and payment for Manufactured Home  Lot Loan s and Combination Loan s 
are subject to the requirements stated in Title  I Claims for Manufactured Homes  and Property 
Disposition o f Manufactured Homes . The Lender must submit the claim that includes the  
sum of the following amounts:

enforceable Judgment  for the unpaid balance of the Loan.  
(C) Assignment Delay at a Recorder ’s Office  
The Lender must wait until the recorded assignment is returned from the recorder’s 
office before sending the claim package to HUD. If there is a delay in receiving the 
original recorded lien assignment back from the recorder’s office, the Lender must 
not d elay its claim submission to HUD past the Claim Filing Deadline . In this 
situation, the Lender must send the claim package to HUD with the following 
documentation in lieu of the original, recorded assignment:  
• a copy of the executed, unrecorded assignment;  
• reasonable evidence that the assignment was sent for recording before the 
expiration of the claim filing deadline. Examples of evidence include a check 
to pay the local recorder, a dated receipt from the recorder, or proof of mailing 
(i.e., stamped certifi ed mail receipt); and  
• a statement signed by an authorized officer of the Lender stating:  
o The copy of the executed assignment is a true and exact copy of what was 
sent to the recorder.  
o The recorded copy of the lien assignment could not be obtained before the 
end of the claim filing period due to delays in the recorder’s office.  
o The Lender will promptly forward the lien assignment to HUD upon 
receipt of the recorded original.  
o The Lender will repurchase the Loan at any time if this delay results in 
harm to HUD or if the Lender fails to send the recorded lien assignment to 
HUD in a timely fashion.

C. Title I Claims  
1. Title I Claims for Property Improvement  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1661  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 When the original lien assignment is received from the recorder’s office, it should be 
identified by the FHA case number (and by the claim number if available) and sent to 
the FOC . 
c. Calculation of Insurance Claim Payment  (12/21/2022 ) 
i. Reserve  Account  
Reserve  Account refers to 10 percent of  the amount disbursed, advanced, or expended by 
the Lender in originating or purchasing eligible Loans registered for insurance under Title  
I, less the amount of all insurance claims approved for payment in connection with losses 
on such Loans.  
The claim payment is calculated as 90 percent of the valid claim amount, not to exceed 
the amount remaining in a Lender’s insurance reserve account.  
A valid claim includes:  
• the unpaid loan obligation;  
• interest on the unpaid loan obligation;  
• uncollected court costs;  
• attorney’s fees;  
• expenses for recording assignments; and  
• the cost of force -placed  Flood Insurance  where  required.  
ii. Unpaid Amount of the Loan Obligation  
(A) Definition  
The Unpaid Amount of the Loan Obligation refers to the net unpaid principal and the 
uncollected interest earned to the date of Default, calculated according to the 
Actuarial Method.  
Actuarial Method refers to the method of allocating payments made on a Loan 
between the outstanding balance of the principal amount borrowed and the interest 
due on a loan obligation, under which a payment is applied first to the accrued 
interest, and any remainder is subtracted from, or any deficiency is added to, the 
unpaid balance of the obligation.  
(B) Standard  
If the Lender obtained HUD’s prior approval to proceed against the loan security  and 
later files a claim for any remaining loss, the unpaid amount of the Title  I loan 
obligation must be reduced by the proceeds received from the Property’s sales or 
disposition, after deducting the following:  
• the balances due on any obligations senior to the Title  I obligation;  
• customary and reasonable expenses for foreclosure  and disposition, as 
determined by HUD;

C. Title I Claims  
1. Title I Claims for Property Improvement  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1663  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 e. Method and Notification of Payment  (05/09/2022 ) 
The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996  directs federal agencies to disburse funds via 
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).  
i. Electronic Funds Transfer  
In order to receive claim payments, the Lender must have completed the SF 3881  form, 
ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment . 
To wire payments to a Lender’s bank account, HUD must receive a completed SF 3881 
form. Processing this form takes several weeks as does testing through the Federal 
Reserve  System. It is advisable for a Lender to have the form on file with HUD before 
filing a claim. The form can be obtained from the FOC . After completing the SF 3881 
form, Lenders must mail it to the address on the form.  
ii. Notification and Identification of Claim Payment  
Upon claim payment, a record will be attached to each EFT payment that includes the 
FHA case number and the Lender’s loan number reported to HUD when the Loan was 
first reported for insurance. Details of the claim status and claim payment of a Loan can 
be found  online using FHAC.  
iii. Lender Responsibilities after Insurance Claim Payment  
The Lender must not attempt to collect money from the Borrower, including the 
coinsurance loss, after a claim is paid. Since the loan Note is assigned to the United 
States, the Lender has no basis from which to make demand upon a Borrower.  
After claim payment, the Lender must refer any legal notices, inquiries, correspondence, 
or payment to HUD’s FOC.  
f. Supplemental Claim  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Definition  
A Supplemental Insurance Claim refers to a claim request for additional reimbursement. 
A supplemental claim may be filed for reimbursable costs where the receipts were 
unavailable or not included with the initial claim.  
ii. Standard  
A supplemental claim must be filed within six months after the date of the payment on 
the initial claim.

Handbook 4000.1   1664  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 iii. Required Documentation  
The Lender must submit a supplemental claim on form HUD -637. Lenders must provide 
an explanation for additional reimbursement, along with supporting documentation and 
receipts.  
A fee of $100 payable to HUD must accompany each supplemental claim. The $100 will 
be returned to the Lender if the supplemental claim was due to HUD error.  
g. Terminating Title  I Premium Billing  (05/09/2022 ) 
Title  I Lender s are obligated to pay the loan insurance premium on any insured Loan until it 
matures, or until the Loan is prepaid in full or an insurance claim is filed. This obligation 
continues even if:  
• the Lender has exhausted its insurance coverage reserve account, provided that the 
Loan is current; and/or  
• the Lender decides to terminate its Title  I Contract of Insurance . 
Terminated Title  I Lender s may not originate new Title I Loans but remain obligated to pay 
FHA insurance premiums and to perform obligations under the Contract of Insurance  for the 
existing Title I Loans it holds.  
h. Abbreviated Claim  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Standard  
The abbreviated filing process allows insurance termination on Defaulted Loans when 
there is no expectation of claim payment. The Lender may submit an abbreviated claim to 
terminate premium billing when:  
• the Loan is in Default and no Reserves are left; or  
• the claim would not be payable for other reasons.  
ii. Required Documentation  
The Lender must submit:  
• form HUD -637, Part II with items 1 –10 and 15 –18 completed. The Lender, or an 
agent of the Lender with proper Power of Attorney  (POA), must sign form HUD -
637, with their full name and title  included in box 16;  
• a certification stating that the claim is being filed to stop premium charges, no 
claim payment is expected and no claim resubmission will occur. The Lender, or 
an agent of the Lender with proper POA , must sign the certification. Please also 
indicate that there are no Reserves, or why no claim payment is expected;  
• copies of the Notices of Default and Acceleration. In the event that the Lender 
could not issue the notice due to bankruptcy , include documentation of the 
bankruptcy filing;

1. Title I Claims for Property Improvement  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1665  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 • documentation verifying that the Lender has updated credit bureau reporting to 
show Default has occurred; and  
• a copy of the Note and security instrument (where applicable). No assignment to 
HUD is required. If the Lender does not have a copy of the Note, the Lender may 
send HUD a Missing Document Statement for the Note along with the copy of the 
security instrument, if the security instrument details the terms of the Loan.  
Lenders must mail the abbreviated claim package to the FOC. To expedite processing, 
the Lender must use an attention line of “Abbreviated Claim Filing.”  
iii. HUD Review of Abbreviated Claim  
HUD will review the documentation to ensure that the Loan is a Title  I Loan previously 
reported for insurance and that a Default has occurred. Once confirmed, HUD will accept 
the abbreviated claim filing and deny the claim benefits since it is not payable.  
This claim denial will stop subsequent insurance charges from being billed. Lenders can 
confirm termination of billing by reviewing their next monthly Title  I billing statement. 
These Loans will appear in the “RENEWAL CANCELLATION” section of the bill.  
i. Denial of Insurance Claims  (05/09/2022 ) 
HUD may deny a claim for insurance in whole or in part based upon a violation of the 
regulations.  
i. Invalid Debt  
If the enforceability of the lien can be challenged, the Lender can obtain a Judgment  
against the Borrower and assign the Judgment to HUD. For example, improper wording 
of or method of mailing a legal notice may call into question whether a deficiency debt is 
valid. Acquiring a Judgment will prove the validity of the debt.  
ii. Missing or Incomplete Work Description  
HUD may deny the claim if the supporting documentation regarding the property 
improvements does not include sufficient detail to confirm that the loan proceeds were 
used solely for property improvements (and eligible fees/charges), that the costs were 
reasonable, and that all improvements were eligible. HUD will review the Completion 
Certificate, the inspection report, and any lender noncompliance reports in addition to the 
contract, Work Write -Up, or other written description of the proposed improvements. 
HUD may pay a claim despite a poor work description if the inspection confirms that 100 
percent of the proceeds went to eligible improvements (and eligible fees/charges), but 
will deny a claim wi th a poor work description and other documentation that indicates 
misuse of loan proceeds.

If a claim is filed after the Claim Filing Deadline , the Lender must request a waiver to 
document that the late filing was unavoidable. Note that a servicing error by the Lender is 
not considered a valid basis for a waiver.  
iv. Unresolved Borrower Complaints  
HUD may deny a claim if there are unresolved valid borrower complaints against the 
Dealer or the Lender because a Loan with an unresolved complaint may not be valid and 
enforceable against the Borrower. The Lender may resubmit the claim with additional 
documentation regarding the resolution of the complaint or if the Lender obtains a 
Judgment  against the Borrower. Obtaining a Judgment against the Borrower will prove the 
validity of the debt.  
v. Note and/or Assignme nt Not an Original  
The Lender must file a Missing Document Statement  if the Lender cannot locate the 
original Note and/or Assignment of Note.  
vi. Evidence of Borrower’s Ownership Interest in the Property  
The case binder  must contain evidence of the Borrower’s ownership interest in the 
Property.  
vii. Notice of Default and Acceleration Non compliance  
HUD may deny the claim when the Notice of Default and Acceleration  does not comply 
with requirements.  
viii. Missing or Incorrect Information on Form HUD -637, Title  I Claim for Loss  
The Lender will be notified by the FOC if a revised form HUD -637 is required due to 
missing or incorrect information. The revised form must be signed by an authorized 
official of the Lender prior to resubmitting the form to HUD.  
j. Resubmitted Claims  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Standard  
The Lender must resubmit the claim to HUD within six months of the date of HUD’s 
denial letter.

for processing with the claim package. Should the FOC uphold the denial, the FOC will 
forward the appeal to the Office of Single Family Program Development, Home Mortg age 
Insurance Division for review. The Home Mortgage Insurance Division will communicate 
the final decision to the FOC, who will respond to the Lender. An appeal request must 
include the following:  
• the regulation in dispute;  
• the Lender’s interpretation of the regulation;  
• why HUD’s current interpretation is incorrect;  
• any other documentation supporting the Lender’s interpretation of the regulation;  
• actions the Lender took to meet the Lender’s interpretation of the regulations; and  
• evidence in the claim binder demonstrating these actions.  
l. Rescinding or Repurchasing a Claim  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Voluntary Recall of a Claim  
(A) Rescinding a Claim  
The Lender may recall a claim at any point prior to claim payment. The rescission 
request must be sent in writing to the FOC and must clearly identify which claim is

the Lender.  
(B) Repurchasing a Claim  
A Lender may repurchase a claim for any reason if the claim payment amount is 
returned within 31 Days of the claim payment date. After 31 Days, HUD retains the 
right to determine whether it is in the best interest of HUD to return the claim. The 
repurchase  request must be sent to the FOC and must clearly identify which claim is 
being recalled. The request must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of 
the Lender. If repurchase is approved, the Lender must send a separate payment equal 
to the amou nt of the claim to the lockbox address for Title  I payments.  
ii. Involuntary Repurchase  
FHA may demand that the Lender repurchase a Loan when the Note is invalid or 
unenforceable, or for violation of FHA’s regulations. FHA’s demand for repurchase may 
occur up to two years after the date that the claim is paid.

Handbook 4000.1   1668  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 FHA may demand repurchase at any time with no time limit upon finding fraud or 
misrepresentation on the part of the claimant in the Loan’s origination. When a Loan is 
repurchased, FHA will return the claim file to the Lender.  
Failure to return a claim payment after demand could result in interest, administrative 
costs and penalties being assessed against the Lender. Continued failure to pay may result 
in referral to HUD’s Mortgagee Review Board  (MRB), the Department of the Treasury, 
or the Department of Justice (DOJ)  for further action to enforce collection of the debt.  
m. Lender Responsibilities Pending Insurance Claim Payment  (05/09/2022 ) 
If an insurance claim is pending payment, the Lender must not pursue active collections  
against the Borrower, but must take all steps necessary to protect the interests of HUD and 
the Lender.  
The Lender is responsible for keeping information current for a claim that has already been 
submitted, but not yet paid.  
i. Legal Notices  
The Lender is responsible for answering bankruptcy , foreclosure  and other legal notices 
and forwarding the information to HUD.  
ii. Borrower Payments  
If a Borrower sends a payment while an insurance claim is pending, the Lender must 
accept it. The Lender then may either retain the payment and submit an amended form 
HUD -637, or hold the payment and forward it to the FOC after HUD pays the claim.  
If a Lender opts not to submit an amended form HUD -637, the Lender may contact the 
FOC to advise that a payment is being held and request that processing of the claim be 
expedited so that the payment can be forwarded to the FOC . 
iii. Release of Liability  
The Lender must not release the Borrower or any co -maker or Co -signer  from liability 
under the Note unless in connection with an assumption , or unless approved in advance 
by HUD. The Lender may seek approval from HUD by sending a written request to the 
FOC . The Lender’s submission to the FOC must include:

Handbook 4000.1   1669  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 2. Title  I Claims for Manufactured Home s 
Since HUD does not take the Property upon Default, the claim paid by HUD is based on the 
deficiency balance. HUD requires the Lender to sell the Property prior to submitting a claim and 
requires the claim payment to be based on the Best Price Obtainable . 
If the repossessed Property is not covered by hazard or flood insurance and is subsequently 
damaged, the Lender bears responsibility for the loss. The appraised value, for claim purposes, 
will be based on the retail value of comparable homes in undamaged condition, without any 
deduction for such damage.  
a. Pre-claim Requirements  (05/09/2022 ) 
The Lender may not file a claim until all default servicing remedies stated in Loan Default 
and Loss Mitigation  have been applied. This servicing includes sending the Notice of Default 
and Acceleration, repossessing the Manufactured Home , appraising the home, sending the 
Notice of Sale, and selling the home.  
b. Maximum Claim Filing Deadline  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Definition  
The Date of Default is 30 Days after the due date of the first unpaid installment.  
Funds received by the Lender that equal a full installment, when applied to the overdue 
installments in the order in which they became due, advance the date of the oldest unpaid 
installment.  
ii. Standard  
The Lender must file a claim not later than three months after the date of sale of the 
Property securing the Loan, but not to exceed 18 months after the date of Default.  
iii. Exception to Claim Filing Deadline  
Exceptions to the maximum claim filing period are allowed when the Lender can 
document that the length of delay was reasonable based on the following:  
• litigation related to the Loan, including bankruptcy , if initiated prior to the end of 
the claim filing deadline. The claim must be filed within three months of the end 
of the litigation;  
• management control of the Lender is assumed by a federal or state agency (e.g., 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC));

disaster declared by the President of the United States , provided the claim is filed 
no later than 12 months after the date of Default ;

the recourse agreement, the claim file must adequately document that enforcement w as 
not possible.  
Any recourse must first be used to reimburse the Lender for any of its losses on its 10 
percent not covered by federal insurance. Any amounts remaining would offset any claim 
amount the Lender would make to FHA. FHA would not receive any of the recourse 
funds.  
v. Assignment of Lenders’ Rights to the United States  
(A) Note Assignment  
The claim package must include an assignment of the Lender’s entire interest in the 
loan Note to the United States. The assignment of the loan Note must be completed in 
the following format:

Lenders must repossess and attempt to resell the Manufactured Home  before 
submitting a claim to HUD.  
If the Lender obtained a Judgment  against the Borrower(s), or obtained additional 
security for the Loan beyond the minimum security required by HUD, then the

the assignee and the FHA Title  I case number.  
The security assignment must be recorded prior to filing the insurance claim and the 
original recorded assignment document must be included in the claim package. If the 
Lender submitted the security assignment for recording in a timely fashion, but 
cannot provide the recorded document with the claim package due to delay at the 
recorder’s office, or other circumstances beyond the Lender’s control, the Lender 
must still file its claim prior to the claim filing deadline. Instead of the recorded 
assignment, the  claim package must include the following documents:  
• a copy of the executed, unrecorded assignment;  
• reasonable evidence that the assignment was sent for recording before the 
expiration of the claim filing period. Reasonable evidence includes a copy of 
the dated check used to pay the local recorder, a dated receipt from the local 
recorder for the recordin g fees, or proof of mailing (e.g., certified slip, green 
card) of assignment to local recorder; and  
• a statement signed by an authorized official of the Lender stating:  
o the copy of the executed assignment is a true and exact copy of what was 
sent to the recorder’s office;  
o the recorded copy of the lien assignment could not be obtained before the 
end of the claim filing period due to delays in the recorder’s office; and  
o the Lender will promptly forward the lien assignment to HUD upon 
receipt of the recorded copy.  
(C) Valid and Enforceable When Assigned  
The loan obligation must be valid and enforceable against the Borrower when 
assigned to the United States. If HUD has reason to believe that an obligation is not 
valid or enforceable, the claim may be denied (or HUD may demand repurchase if a 
claim is already paid). The Lender may resubmit the claim after obtaining a valid and 
enforceable Judgment  for the unpaid balance of the Loan.  
e. Calculation of Insurance Claim Payment  (05/09/2022 ) 
HUD calculates the claim payment as follows:

received from a Partial Payment to a full monthly installment must be applied to the Loan 
and advance the next payment due date and the associated date of Default.  
The loan balance as of the date of Default is the balance as of the last credited payment plus 
accrued interest up to 30 Days past the due date of the first unpaid installment.  
The loan balance at Default is calculated by posting the borrower payments using simple 
interest.  
g. Interim Interest  (05/09/2022 ) 
Interim Interest refers to the interest the Lender earns from the date of Default to the claim 
submission date on form HUD -637, plus 15 Days.  
HUD pays interim interest on the loan balance, up to a maximum of nine months of interest.  
The interim interest rate is the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate , as determined and 
posted by the Department of the Treasury.

m. Updating the Insurance Claim  (05/09/2022 ) 
A Lender is responsible for keeping information current for a claim that has already been 
submitted, but not yet paid.  
n. Method and Notification of Payment  (05/09/2022 ) 
The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996  directs federal agencies to disburse funds via 
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).  
i. Electronic Funds Transfer  
In order to receive claim payments, the Lender must have completed the SF 3881  form, 
ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment . 
To wire payments to a Lender’s bank account, HUD must receive a completed SF 3881 
form. Processing this form takes several weeks as does testing through the Federal 
Reserve  System. It is advisable for a Lender to have the form on file with HUD before 
filing a claim. The form can be obtained from the FOC . Lenders must mail the completed 
SF 3881 form to the address on the form.  
ii. Notification and Identification of Payment  
Upon claim payment, a record will be attached to each EFT payment that includes the 
FHA case number and the Lender’s loan number reported to HUD when the Loan was 
first reported for insurance. Details of the claim status and claim payment of a Loan can 
be found online using FHAC.  
iii. Lender Responsibilities after Insurance Claim Payment  
The Lender must not attempt to collect money from the Borrower, including the 
coinsurance loss, after a claim is paid. Since the loan Note is assigned to the United 
States, the Lender has no basis from which to make demand upon a Borrower.

o. Supplemental Claim  (05/09/2022 ) 
i. Definition  
A Supplemental Insurance Claim refers to a claim request for additional reimbursement. 
A supplemental claim may be filed for reimbursable costs where the receipts were 
unavailable or not included with the initial claim.  
ii. Standard  
A supplemental claim must be filed within six months after the date of the payment on 
the initial claim.  
iii. Required Documentation  
The Lender must submit a supplemental claim on form HUD -637. Lenders must provide 
an explanation for additional reimbursement, along with supporting documentation and 
receipts.  
A fee of $100 payable to HUD must accompany each supplemental claim. The $100 will 
be returned to the Lender if the supplemental claim was due to HUD error.  
p. Terminating Title  I Premium Billing  (05/09/2022 ) 
Title  I Lender s are obligated to pay the loan insurance premium on any insured Loan until it 
matures, or until the Loan is prepaid in full or an insurance claim is filed. This obligation 
continues even if:  
• the Lender has exhausted its insurance coverage reserve account, provided that the 
Loan is current; and/or  
• the Lender decides to terminate its Title  I Contract of Insurance . 
The Title  I insurance may be terminated under the following circumstances:  
• the Lender files a claim on a Defaulted Loan; or  
• the Title  I Loan is paid in full. (Enter “paid -in-full” as the exception reason on the 
Annual Exception Payment screen, under Title I Servicing in FHAC.)  
q. Abbreviated Claim  (05/09/2022 ) 
The abbreviated filing process allows insurance termination on Defaulted Loans when there 
is no expectation of claim payment. The Lender may submit an abbreviated claim to 
terminate premium billing when:  
• the Loan is in Default and no Reserves are left; and/or  
• the Lender knows a Defaulted Loan is ineligible for claim payment.

2. Title I Claims for Manufactured Homes  
 
Handbook 4000.1   1677  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 i. Required Docum entation  
The Lender must submit:  
• form HUD –637, Part II with items 1 -9, 15 and 16 completed.  The Lender, or an 
agent of the Lender with proper Power of Attorney  (POA), must sign form HUD -
637, with their full name and title  included in box 16;  
• a certification, stating that the claim is being filed to stop premium charges, no 
claim payment is expected and no claim resubmission will occur. The Lender, or 
an agent of the Lender with proper POA , must sign the certification. Please also 
indicate that there are no Reserves, or why no claim payment is expected;  
• copies of the Notices of Default and Acceleration. In the event that the Lender 
could not issue the notice due to bankruptcy , include documentation of the 
bankruptcy filing;  
• documentation verifying that the Lender has updated credit bureau reporting to 
show Default has occurred; and  
• a copy of the Note and security instrument (where applicable). No assignment to 
HUD is required. If the Lender does not have a copy of the Note, the Lender may 
send HUD a Missing Document Statement for the Note along with the copy of the 
security instrument, if the security instrument details the terms of the Loan.  
Lenders must mail the abbreviated claim package to the FOC. To expedite processing, 
the Lender must use an attention line of “Abbreviated Claim Filing.”  
ii. HUD Review of Abbreviated Claims  
HUD will review the documentation to ensure that the Loan is a Title  I Loan previously 
reported for insurance and that a Default has occurred. Once confirmed, HUD will accept 
the abbreviated claim filing and deny the claim benefits since it is not payable.  
This claim denial will stop subsequent insurance charges from being billed. Lenders can 
confirm termination of billing by reviewing its next monthly Title  I billing statement. 
These Loans will appear in the “RENEWAL CANCELLATION” section of the bill.  
r. Denial of Insurance Claims  (05/09/2022 ) 
Effective for loan applications dated on or after June 1, 2009, when FHA endorses a Loan for 
insurance, the Loan is covered under the Lender’s Contract of Insurance . The insurance 
coverage for the Loan is incontestable from the date of issuance of the certificate of 
insurance except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the claimant in the origination.  
Regardless of the loan application date, FHA may deny a claim in whole or in part, or within 
two years after paying a claim, and recover the claim payment based upon a violation of 
FHA’s requirements for claim submission. If the Note representing the Borro wer’s obligation 
that is assigned to FHA is invalid or unenforceable, or if the Lender making the claim does 
not follow the FHA claim requirements under the insurance contract, FHA may deny 
payment of the claim.

If the enforceability of the lien can be challenged, the Lender can obtain a Judgment  
against the Borrower and assign the Judgment to HUD. A lien may be challenged by 
improper wording of or method of mailing a legal notice, or other events that can 
challenge the validity of the deficiency debt. Acquiring a Judgment will prove the debt is 
valid. 
ii. Missing or Incomplete Claim File Documentation  
The claim package must include all applicable documents listed on form HUD -637. If 
claim documentation is missing or incomplete, the FOC may request the documents from 
the Lender.  
iii. Claim Filing Past the Deadline  
If a claim is filed after the claim filing deadline , the Lender must request a waiver to 
document that the late filing was unavoidable. Note that a servicing error by the Lender is 
not considered a valid basis for a waiver.  
iv. Unresolved Borrower Complaint  
A Borrower complaint that casts doubt on the enforceability of the loan Note must be 
resolved prior to filing a claim. The Lender may resubmit the claim with additional 
documentation regarding the resolution of the complaint or if the Lender obtains a 
Judg ment  against the Borrower. Obtaining a Judgment against the Borrower will prove 
the debt is valid and enforceable.  
v. Note and/or Assignmen t Not an Original  
The Lender may file a Missing Document Statement  if it cannot locate the original Note 
and/or Assignment of Note.  
vi. Error on the Appraisal Obtained in Connection with the Repossession of the 
Manufactured Home  
The Lender must address and resolve appraisal errors directly with the Appraiser. A 
claim may still be paid if errors are not resolved; however, HUD will adjust the claim 
payment amount.  
Errors on the appraisal include, but are not limited to, a property description (including 
model) that does not match the invoice/sales contract , math error in value calculation, 
and/or a value of model options was incorrectly used or omitted.

in question.  
s. Resubmitted Claims  (05/09/2022 ) 
When a claim file is denied, the Lender has the option to resubmit with information to 
resolve the denial.  
i. Standard  
The Lender must resubmit the claim to HUD within six months of the date of HUD’s 
denial letter.  
ii. Required Documentation  
A resubmitted insurance claim package must contain the following:  
• an updated form HUD -637; and  
• documentation and explanation to address reasons for denial; or  
• explanation on why HUD’s requests for additional documentation or explanation 
do not apply to this particular Loan.  
t. Appeals  (05/09/2022 ) 
The Lender may appeal a denial of insurance benefits. The appeal must be sent to the FOC 
for processing with the claim package. Should the FOC uphold the denial, it will forward the 
appeal to the Office of Single Family Program Development, Home Mortgage Insurance 
Division for review. The Home Mortgage Insurance Division will c ommunicate the final 
decision to the FOC, who will respond to the Lender. An appeal request must include the 
following:  
• the regulation in dispute;  
• the Lender’s interpretation of the regulation;  
• why HUD’s current interpretation is incorrect;  
• any other documentation supporting the Lender’s interpretation of the regulation;  
• actions the Lender took to meet the Lender’s interpretation of the regulations; and  
• evidence in the claim binder demonstrating these actions.

i. Voluntary Recall of a Claim  
(A) Rescinding a Claim (Pre -claim Payment)  
The Lender may recall a claim at any point prior to claim payment. The rescission 
request must be sent in writing to the FOC and must clearly identify which claim is 
being recalled. The request must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of 
the Lender.  
(B) Repurchasing a Claim (Pos t-claim Payment)  
The Lender may repurchase a claim for any reason if the claim payment amount is 
returned within 31 Days of the claim payment date. After 31 Days, HUD retains the 
right to determine whether it is in the best interest of HUD to return the claim. The 
repurcha se request must be sent to the FOC and must clearly identify which claim is 
being recalled. The request must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of 
the Lender. If repurchase is approved, the Lender must send a separate payment equal 
to the cl aim amount of the claim to the lockbox address for Title  I payments.  
ii. Involuntary Repurchase (HUD’s Demand for Repurchase of a Claim)  
FHA may demand that the Lender repurchase a Loan when the Note is invalid or 
unenforceable, or for violating FHA’s claim submission requirements. FHA’s demand for 
repurchase may occur up to two years after the date that the claim is paid.  
FHA may demand repurchase at any time with no time limit upon finding fraud or 
misrepresentation on the part of the claimant in the Loan’s origination. Consistent with 
existing practice, when a Loan is repurchased, FHA will return the claim file to the 
Lender. 
Failure to return a claim payment after demand could result in interest, administrative 
costs and penalties being assessed against the Lender. Continued failure to pay may result 
in referral to HUD’s Mortgagee Review Board  (MRB), the Department of the Treasury, 
or the Department of Justice (DOJ)  for further action to enforce collection of the debt.

1. Property Disposition for Property Improvement Loans  
a. Lender Option to Proceed Against the Security  (05/09/2022 ) 
After acceleration of the maturity  on a Defaulted Loan, the Lender may file a claim under its 
Contract of Insurance . If the Loan is secured, the Lender may opt instead to collect the Loan 
by proceeding against the loan security rather than via claim submission to HUD. The Lender 
might opt to collect via the security (rather than via its Title  I insurance) if the Lender 
determines that it will likely recover more than the 90 percent insurance payment it will 
receive from HUD and/or if the Lender wishes to avoid a reduction in its Title I insurance 
coverage reserve account.  
i. Prior Approval Required  
If the Lender wants to proceed against the loan security and later file a Title  I insurance 
claim for any remaining loss, the Lender must obtain prior approval from HUD.  
The Lender must submit a written request for prior approval to the Home Mortgage 
Insurance Division. The request should include:  
• the status of the Title  I Loan, and an appraisal of the Property;  
• the amount and position of all unpaid liens against the Property;  
• estimated costs of foreclosure  and disposition; and  
• the anticipated time to acquire and dispose of the Property.  
ii. Deficiency Judgment  Required  
In proceeding against the security, the Lender must comply with all applicable state and 
local laws, and must take all actions necessary to preserve its rights to obtain a valid and 
enforceable deficiency Judgment  against the Borrower.  
b. Foreclosure  by Other Lien Holder  (05/09/2022 ) 
If another lien holder starts a foreclosure  action against the Property that secures a Title  I 
Loan, the Title I Lender  must monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to 
preserve its rights. HUD does not require that the Title I Lender bid at a foreclosure sale or 
acquire title to the Property. The Lender may submit a claim if the Title I Loan is in Default 
and otherwise eligible before, or after, the foreclosure action is completed.  
If the Title  I Lender  elects to bid at a foreclosure  sale to acquire title to the Property, then the 
Lender is “proceeding against the loan security” and the requirements outlined above will 
apply.  
If the foreclosure  action is completed prior to the Title  I Lender  submitting a claim to HUD, 
the Lender must determine if excess funds exist after foreclosure, and document that 
determination in the case binder . If excess funds are available, the Lender must take

the Title I Lender and document the Lender’s actions.  
c. Enforceable Note  (05/09/2022 ) 
The Lender must service the Loan in a manner that will preserve the right to collect the Loan. 
If necessary, a Lender may obtain a Judgment  against the Borrower to establish 
enforceability.  
2. Property Disposition of Manufactured Home s 
a. Proceedin g against the Loan Security  (05/09/2022 ) 
After acceleration of the maturity on a Defaulted Loan, the Lender must proceed against the 
loan security by repossession or foreclosure  of the collateral. Any action must be in 
compliance with all applicable state and local laws, and the Lender must acquire proper 
marketable title  to the Manufactured Home  securing the Loan. The Lender must also take all 
actions necessary under federal, state and local law to preserve its rights to obtain an 
enforceable deficiency against the Borrower.  
b. Abandonment  (05/09/2022 ) 
If the Lender determines that the Manufactured Home  has been abandoned, the Lender may 
proceed against the security without waiting for the expiration of the 30 -Day period provided 
in the Notice of Default and Acceleration . The Lender must document how it determined that 
the home was abandoned.  
c. Condition Report  (05/09/2022 ) 
Prior to repossession, the Lender or its agent must make a visual inspection of the 
Manufactured Home  and prepare a report regarding the condition of the home. The report 
must also detail the condition of any components or accessories that were financed with the 
Manufactured Home (e.g., refrigerator, air conditioner, etc.), and list any that are missing. 
The report must be retained in the case binder . 
d. Appraisal  (05/09/2022 ) 
The Lender must obtain an appraisal of the secured Property in compliance with Appraiser 
and Property Requirements for Title  I Loans . The Lender must obtain the appraisal as soon as 
possible after repossession, or earlier with the permission of the Borrower. The appraisal 
must be performed on the home site unless the site owner requires that the home be removed 
before the appraisal can be performed. The appraisal must reflect the current value of 
comparable Manufactured Home s in similar condition and in the same geographic area where 
the repossession occurred. The appraised value is part of the calculation of the insurance 
claim payment.

If the Manufactured Home  is damaged while in the possession of the Lender, the Lender 
must document the nature of the damage and seek repair through their hazard insurance 
coverage. If the Manufactured Home is without hazard insurance, the appraisal should reflect 
value as if the re were no damage.  
g. Salvage  (05/09/2022 ) 
If the repossessed Manufactured Home  is in such poor condition that it cannot be made 
usable again, the Appraiser must demonstrate that fact. The appraisal should reflect the 
Manufactured Home’s salvage value and the method used to determine the value.  
h. Repossession and Preservation Expenses  (05/09/2022 ) 
All repossession and preservation expenses paid to a third party must be documented in the 
case binder . Such expenses include legal fees, the cost to move the home, the cost of the 
appraisal, hazard insurance premiums, personal property taxes, and site rental. All receipts 
must be legible and detailed to identify the unit, Borrower, date, amount, purpose, and parties 
involved in the transaction. Note that there are limits to HUD’s reimbursement for legal fees 
and moving costs  in its calculation of the Lender’s claim payment.  
i. Acquisition by Voluntary Conveyance or Surrender  (05/09/2022 ) 
Instead of repossession, a Lender may accept a voluntary conveyance of title  or ownership of 
the Property securing a Manufactured Home  Loan which is in Default, provided that:  
• the Lender accepts the conveyance in full satisfaction of the Borrower’s obligation 
and no Title  I claim is submitted to HUD; or  
• the Lender may accept voluntary surrender of the Property without satisfaction of the 
Borrower’s obligation and submit a Title  I claim to HUD. The Lender must dispose 
of the Property in compliance with state and local laws so as to ensure that it can 
assign to HUD a valid and legally enforceable obligation against the Borrower for 
any deficiency.  
If a Lender accepts a voluntary conveyance of title  or a voluntary surrender of the Property, 
the Notice of Default and Acceleration is not required.

Cash for Key s is a monetary consideration offered as an alternative to legal eviction to 
property occupants after foreclosure . 
ii. Standard  
The amount paid under this policy must be customary and reasonable for the jurisdiction, 
up to $1,000 per dwelling, on the condition that the occupant peacefully vacates a

the Cash for Key s offer. Occupants are required to leave the Property in Broom -swept 
Condition. All components (e.g., appliances, fixtures, inside or outside heating unit, 
inside or outside air conditioning unit, carport) must be left with the Property.  
Servicers  must inspect the vacant Properties within 15 Days after the occupants vacate 
the Property and prior to releasing the funds to ensure that the occupants have complied 
with their agreement on the condition of the Property.  
The amount paid under the Cash for Key s policy may be included in a claim amount, and 
is subject to standard coverage of 90 percent, limited by the amount in the Lender’s 
reserve account.

sales contract . The Manufactured Home must be sold in a commercially acceptable manner, 
including all legally required notifications to the Borrower(s).  
i. Best Price Obtainable  
When the Lender obtains title  to the Property securing a Manufactured Home  Loan 
through repossession or foreclosure , the Property must be sold for the best price 
obtainable before submitting an insurance claim.  
(A) Definition  
The Best Price Obtainable refers to the greater of:  
• the actual sales price of the Property, after deducting the cost of  
o repairs to make the home habitable,  
o cleaning and reconditioning,  
o upgrades to the home requested by a buyer,  
o making home furnishings, and equipment needed to make the Property 
marketable, and

to a new home site; or  
• the appraised value of the Property before repairs (as determined by a HUD -
approved appraisal obtained in accordance with Appraiser and Property 
Requirements for Title  I Loans . 
(B) Standard  
A Lender’s objective in selling the Manufactured Home  is to obtain the maximum net 
return in order to minimize the loss to HUD and to the Lender, and to minimize the 
deficiency amount that will be owed by the Borrower. The Lender should attempt to 
sell the home for a net sales price of no less than the retai l appraised value of the 
home. A Lender may sell a home for less than the retail appraised value, but HUD’s 
calculation of the insurance claim payment will be based on the best price obtainable.  
ii. Cost to Make the Manufactured Home  Marketable  
Any expense paid to a third party to facilitate a sale by making the home marketable must 
be documented in the case binder . A receipt must be legible and detailed to identify the 
unit, Borrower, date, amount, purpose, and parties involved in the transaction. Items may 
include the cost of repairs, furnishings, transportation, and set -up. Any expense dated 
after the resale date  will not be eligible for eventual insurance claim reimbursement.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023 iii. Extra Items Sold with the Repossessed Manufactured Home  
If a Lender sells an extra item in addition to the repossessed Manufactured Home  to 
induce the sale, the extra item must be itemized on the sales contract  and a value 
provided. This will allow the deduction of the item (i.e., a new washer and dryer, when 
none existed before) from the sales price to arrive at the sale value of the repossessed 
Manufactured Home for the purpose of claim calculation.  
iv. Sales Commission  
The amount of a sales commission paid to a third party must be documented in the case 
binder . Determination of whether the Manufactured Home  was sold on - or off -site must 
be part of the documentation. Note that HUD limits the amount of Sales Commission  that 
can be included in its calculation of the Lender’s claim payment.  
v. Enforceable Note  
The Lender must service the Loan in a manner that will preserve a post -repossession 
resale deficiency, where state law allows. If necessary, a Lender may obtain a Judgment  
against the Borrower to establish enforceability.  
vi. Lender Responsibility While Insurance Claim is Pending  
If an insurance claim is pending payment, a Lender must not pursue active collections  
against the Borrower, but should take all steps necessary to protect the interests of HUD 
and the Lender.  
vii. Legal Notices  
The Lender is responsible for answering legal notices (e.g., bankruptcy ) and forwarding 
the information to the FOC.  
viii. Borrower Payment before Claim Payment  
If a Borrower sends a payment while an insurance claim is pending, the Lender may 
either amend its form HUD -637, Title I Claim for Loss , or request that claim payment be 
expedited so that the payment can be forwarded to HUD.  
ix. Prohibition against Coinsurance Recovery  
The Lender must not attempt to collect money from the Borrower, including the 
coinsurance loss, after a claim is paid. Since the loan Note is assigned to the United 
States, the Lender has no basis from which to make demand upon a Borrower.  
x. Borrower Payment after Claim Payment  
All payments received by a Lender after claim payment must be promptly transmitted to 
the FOC.

HUD scores and classifies all Mortgagees as a Public Scorer, Public Provisional 
Scorer or Private Scorer.  
A Mortgagee must have a continual 12 months of performance or is automatically 
opted out for that fiscal year’s scores. In addition, a Mortgagee must meet the 
criteria of either Public Scorer or Public Provisional Scorer to be eligible for 
increased incentives.  
A Mortgagee who is contemplating and/or anticipating an institution level acquisition 
or merger may contact the NSC at sfdatarequests@hud.gov  to discuss scoring impacts 
and ramifications. For more information about transferor and transferee 
responsibilities during an acquisition or merger, see Responsibility for Servicing 
Actions .

• is approved to service Single Family Mortgages;  
• has an active approval status; and  
• is the Servicer  of record for a seriously delinquent portfolio of more than 
25 Mortgages . 
A Mortgagee classified as a Public Scorer has no option to opt out. The 
Mortgagee’s final fiscal year end score will be made available to the public and is 
eligible for increased incentives associated with achieving a Tier 1.  
(2) Public Provisional Scorer

A Mortgagee will be classified as a Private Scorer when the Mortgagee  is the 
Servicer  of record for a seriously delinquent portfolio of less than five Mortgages.  
A Mortgagee classified as a Private Scorer  is automatically opted out. The 
Mortgagee’s final fiscal year end score will not be made available to the public 
and is not eligible for increased incentives associated with achieving a Tier 1.  
(B) Who Receives the Score  
Mortgagees are scored on specific case performance on four TRS  II elements as the 
Servicer  of record per HUD's insurance system when any of the following is 
triggered:  
• SFDMS reporting: the Mortgagee that is the Servicer  of record and is 
performing loss mitigation for the current default episode;  
• loss mitigation engagement: the Mortgagee that executes the Loss Mitigation 
Option , or files the claim;  
• foreclosure  prevention: the Mortgagee that initiates the foreclosure; or  
• Re-Defaults: the Mortgagee that executed the initial Loss Mitigation Option  
prior to the Re -Default.  
Additional information related to this can also be found in the  TRS II – Scorecard 
Calculation Methodology – Servicer  Narrative . 
(C) Process to Opt Out  
The Mortgagee must determine if it qualifies to opt  out. To request to opt out of 
scoring, the Mortgagee must submit a request to NSC via email to 
sfdatarequests@hud.gov , no later than October 31 of each calendar year for which the 
Mortgagee requests to opt out of scoring. The Mortgagee must include in the request:  
• “TRS II Opt  Out” in the subject line of their email; and  
• their Mortgagee five -digit ID number.  
Once NSC verifies the Mortgagee’s status, the Mortgagee will receive a confirmation 
email that the Mortgagee has opted out of scoring for the fiscal year.  
(D) Use of Scores  
HUD will continue to score all Mortgagees. Scores for Public Provisional Mortgagees 
who have exercised the opt -out option and for Private Scorers will be used for 
informational purposes and HUD audits.  
HUD will not make publicly available the scores of Mortgagees who have opted out 
of scoring.

Methodology – Servicer  Narrative  for informatio n on how to receive these quarterly 
notices.  
viii. Appeals  
(A) Basis for Appeals  
The only basis for an appeal by the Mortgagee receiving an “F”/Tier 4 is 
disagreement with the data used by HUD to calculate the Mortgagee’s grade. If HUD 
determines that the Mortgagee’s “F”/Tier 4 grade rating was based on incorrect or 
incomplete data, HU D will recalculate the Mortgagee’s performance and will provide 
a corrected score.

A Notice of Deficiency  (NOD) refers to a formal notification from FHA to an 
Appraiser when a review identifies an error or lack of compliance. An NOD is not 
a sanction and is not considered severe enough to require remedial education or 
removal.  
An NOD  is noted on the Appraiser’s record and multiple NODs may result in 
further action by FHA.  
(2) Cause  
An Appraiser may receive an NOD  if an FHA review has determined gaps in due 
diligence and professionalism or errors or noncompliance.  
(3) Notice  
FHA will provide the Appraiser with written notice outlining deficiencies found 
in a specific appraisal.  
(4) Appeal  
An NOD  is not a sanction and no appeal is available.

notification and provide proof of successful completion. Failure to comply with a 
remedial education action may result in escalation of the action to an 
administrative sanction, i ncluding removal from the FHA Appraiser Roster . 
(2) Cause  
Cause for remedial education includes, but is not limited to, identification of more 
serious deficiencies in the appraisal report that indicate lack of competence,

Benefits  The nontaxable portion of these items may be added back 
to the adjusted gross income, if the income is expected to 
continue for the first three years of the Mortgage . 
Adjustments to Income  Adjustments to income may be added back to the 
adjusted gross income if they are : 
• IRA and Keogh retirement deductions ; or 
• penalties on early withdrawal of savings health 
insurance deductions, and Alimony  payments.  
 
Analyzing IRS Form 1120, U.S. Corporat ion Income Tax Return  
A Corporation refers to a state -chartered business owned by its stockholders.  
To determine the Borrower ’s income, the adjusted business income must be multiplied by the 
Borrower ’s percentage of ownership in the business.  
Corporate compensation to the officers, in proportion to the percentage of ownership, is shown 
on the corporate tax return  (IRS Form 1120), and individual tax returns. If the Borrower ’s 
percentage of ownership does not appear on the tax returns, the Mortgagee  must obtain the 
information from the corporations’ accountant, along with evidence that the Borrower  has the 
right to any compensation.  
The table below describes the items found on IRS Form 1120 for which an adjustment must be 
made in order to determine adjusted business income.

Appendix 2.0 – Analyzing IRS Forms (09/20/2021)  
Handbook 4000.1   1757  
Last Revised:  10/31 /2023  Adjustment Item  Description of Adjustment  
Depreciation and Depletion  Add the corporation’s depreciation and depletion back to the 
after-tax income.  
Fiscal Year vs. Calendar Year  If the corporation operates on a fiscal year that is different 
from the calendar year, an adjustment must be made to relate 
corporate income to the individual tax return.  
Cash Withdrawals  The Borrower ’s withdrawal of cash from the corporation may 
have a severe negative impact on the corporation’s ability to 
continue operating.  
Analyzing IRS Form 1120 -S, U.S. Income Tax Return  for an S Corporation  
An “S” Corporation refers to a small start -up business, with gains and losses passed to 
stockholders in proportion to each stockholder’s percentage of business ownership.  
Income for owners of “S” corporations comes from IRS Form  W-2 wages, and is taxed at the 
individual rate. The IRS Form 1120 -S Compensation of officers  line item is transferred to the 
Borrower ’s individual IRS Form 1040 , U.S. Individual Income Tax Return . 
Depreciation and depletion may be added back to income in proportion to the Borrower ’s 
percentage of ownership in the corporation.  
The Borrower ’s income must be reduced proportionately by the total obligations payable by the 
corporation in less than one year.  
Analyzing Schedule K -1 (IRS Form 1065 ), U.S. Return of Partnership Income  
A Partnership refers to when two or more individuals form a business, and share in profits, 
losses, and responsibility for running the company. Each partner pays taxes on their 
proportionate share of the partnership’s net income.  
Both general and limited partnerships report income on IRS Form 1065, and the partners’ share 
of income is carried over to Schedule E of IRS Form 1040.  
Both depreciation and depletion may be added back to the income in proportion to the 
Borrower ’s share of the income.  
The Borrower ’s income must be reduced proportionately by the total obligation payable by the 
partnership in less than one year.

Appendix 4.0 – FHA -Home Affordable Modification Program (FHA -HAMP) Calculations (Applies to 
Servicing Only) (09/26/2022)  
Handbook 4000.1   1765  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023  APPENDIX 4.0 – FHA -HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION 
PROGRAM (FHA -HAMP ) CALCULATIONS (APPLIES TO SERVICING 
ONLY)  (09/26/2022 ) 
The Mortgagee must evaluate Borrowers in the order of each step below. Borrowers must meet 
all eligibility requirements associated with the FHA -HAMP  Option  in accordance with HUD 
guidance.  
Step 1: Review for FHA -HAMP  Standalone Loan Modification  
1. Calculate the target Mortgage Payment : 
A. Calculate 31% of gross income;  
B. Calculate 80% of current Mortgage Payment ; 
C. Calculate 25% of gross income;  
D. Take the greater of B or C; and  
E. The lesser of A or D determines the target Mortgage Payment . 
2. Amortize the total outstanding debt to be resolved at the Market Rate  for a 360 -month 
term to determine the modified Mortgage Payment  required to bring the loan current.  
A. The Mortgagee may capitalize in an FHA -HAMP  Standalone Loan Modification  an 
amount needed to cover:  
1. arrearages, which include Mortgagee advances for escrow items;  
2. the projected escrow shortage amount; and  
3. related legal fees and foreclosure  and bankruptcy  costs for work actually 
performed for the current Default episode as of the date of the foreclosure 
cancellation and not higher than the foreclosure -related fees and costs HUD has 
identified as reasonable and customary.  
If the result of the modified Mortgage Payment  (Step 1.2) is at or below the target Mortgage 
Payment (Step 1.1.E), the Borrower is eligible for an FHA -HAMP  Standalone Loan 
Modification ; if not, go to Step 2.  
Step 2: Review for FHA -HAMP  Standalone Partial Claim   
Step 2.1: Establish the Maximum Partial Claim Amount Available  
The maximum FHA -HAMP  Partial Claim amount available is the lesser of:  
1. the unpaid principal balance on the date of Default at the time of payment of the initial  
Partial Claim, multiplied by 30%, less any previous Partial Claim(s) amount paid on this 
Mortgage; or  
2. if no previous Partial Claim(s) were filed during the life of the loan, the unpaid principal 
balance as of the date of Default for the current Default episode multiplied by 30%.  
If the Borrower has exhausted the maximum Partial Claim amount available, go to Step 3. If not, 
continue to Step 2.2.

Appendix 4.0 – FHA -Home Affordable Modification Program (FHA -HAMP) Calculations (Applies to 
Servicing Only) (09/26/2022)  
Handbook 4000.1   1766  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023  Step 2.2: Determine if the Borrower's Current Mortgage Payment  Meets the Following 
Criteria  
1. the Borrower's current interest rate is at or below Market Rate; and  
2. the Borrower’s current Mortgage Payment  with reanalyzed escrow will be at or below the 
target Mortgage Payment (Step 1.1.E).  
If the Borrower’s current Mortgage Payment  does not meet the above criteria, go to Step 3. If the 
Borrower meets the above criteria, continue to Step 2.3.  
Step 2.3: Calculate th e FHA -HAMP  Standalone Partial Claim  Amount Needed to Bring the 
Loan Current  
The Mortgagee may utilize an FHA -HAMP  Standalone Partial Claim  in an amount needed to 
bring the Borrower current including : 
• arrearages ; 
• Mortgagee advances for escrow items;  
• projected escrow shortage amount; and  
• related legal fees and foreclosure  and bankruptcy  costs for work performed for the 
current Default episode as of the date of the foreclosure cancellation and not higher than 
the foreclosure -related fees and costs HUD has identified as reasonable and customary.  
If the Borrower can resolve the debt without exceeding the maximum Partial Claim amount, the 
current interest rate is at or below the Market Rate, and the current Mortgage Payment  with 
reanalyzed escrow does not exceed the target Mortgage Payment (Step 1.1.E), the Borrower is 
eligible for an FHA -HAMP  Standalone Partial Claim ; if not, go to Step 3.   
Step 3: Review for FHA -HAMP  Combination Loan  Modification and Partial Claim  
The Mortgagee may utilize an FHA -HAMP  Combination Loan  Modification and Partial Claim 
when establishing an affordable monthly payment that requires a Partial Claim in an amount 
needed to cover:  
• arrearages, which include Mortgagee advances for escrow items;  
• projected escrow shortage amount;  
• related legal fees and foreclosure  and bankruptcy  costs for work performed for the 
current Default episode as of the date of the foreclosure cancellation and not higher than 
the foreclosure -related fees and costs HUD has identified as reasonable and customary; 
and 
• principal deferment, if required to meet the target payment.  
No portion of th e FHA -HAMP  Partial Claim may be used to bring the modified monthly 
payment below the target payment.  
Calculate the FHA -HAMP  Partial Claim amount required:  
1. Calculate the required loan amount needed to reach the target Mortgage Payment  from 
Step 1.1.E.

Servicing Only) (09/26/2022)  
Handbook 4000.1   1767  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023  2. Subtract the required loan amount from the total outstanding debt to determine the FHA -
HAMP  Partial Claim amount required to bring the loan current and any required principal 
deferment.  
• If the amount of the FHA -HAMP  Partial Claim required does not exceed the 
maximum Partial Claim amount (Step 2), the Borrower is eligible for an FHA -HAMP 
Combination Loan  Modification at the required loan amount and Partial Claim 
amount needed to bring the loan current.  
• If the amount of the FHA -HAMP  Partial Claim required exceeds the maximum 
Partial Claim amount (Step 2), calculate the maximum modified loan amount.  
Calculate the maximum modified loan amount:  
1. Subtract the maximum Partial Claim amount (Step 2) from the total outstanding debt to 
be resolved (Step 1.2) to determine the maximum modified loan amount.  
2. Re-amortize the maximum modified loan amount at the Market Rate for a 360 -month 
term to determine the modified Mortgage Payment .  
• If the modified Mortgage Payment  is at or less than 40% of the current gross income, 
the Borrower is eligible for an FHA -HAMP  Combination Loan  Modification, at the 
maximum modified loan amount, and an FHA -HAMP  Partial Claim.  
• If the modified Mortgage Payment  is greater than 40% of the current gross income, 
and one or more Borrowers are unemployed, the Mortgagee must review the 
Borrower for a Special Forbearance -Unemployment .  
• If the Borrower has been determined ineligible for all Home Retention Options , but 
has income or other assets to repay the indebtedness within six months, the Borrower 
is eligible for a Formal Forbearance.  
• If the Borrower has been determined ineligible for all Home Retention options the 
Mortgagee must review the Borrower for Home Disposition Option s.

Appendix 8.0 – FHA Defect Taxonomy (09/22/2020)  
Handbook 4000.1   1779  
Last Revised : 10/31 /2023  APPENDIX  8.0 – FHA D EFECT  TAXONOMY  (09/22/2020)  
Effective for Loan Reviews as of 01/01/20  
I. PURPOSE  
  The Defect Taxonomy is FHA’s method of identifying defects at the loan level .  
A) The Defect Taxonomy provides:  
− useful data and feedback through structured categorization of defects and their sources, causes and severities.  
− balance between FHA’s risk management and quality assurance business processes.  
B) The Defect Taxonomy does not : 
− Establish a universal statement on all monitoring or enforcement efforts by FHA.  
− Address FHA’s response to patterns of loan -level defects, regardless of severity.  
− Limit FHA’s actions with regard to fraud or misrepresentation.  
− Establish standards for administrative or civil enforcement action, which are currently set forth in law.  
− Preclude FHA from referring any violation of any severity to HUD’s Mortgagee Review Board , Departmental 
Enforcement Center, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, or other HUD offices for findings that, in FHA’s 
judgment, warrant such referral.  
− Affect or override FHA’s normal process for referral of fraud, waste, or abuse to the Office of the Inspector General.  
II. CORE CONCEPTS  
A)   Defect Areas  
Underwriting loan reviews are categorized into nine defect areas that represent fundamental characteristics of a loan’s 
eligibility for FHA insurance. Defect areas are organized following a consistent pattern of sources, causes, severity tier 
descriptions and potential remedies.  
− Applicable HUD policies are provided for reference; they are subject to change and may not be all -inclusive.     
B) Sources and Causes  
Sources and causes describe Findings in greater detail based on HUD policy requirements. An individual Finding is 
identified in the Loan Review System (LRS) by its specific defect area, source, and cause.  
C) Severity Tiers  
There are four potential severity tiers, one of which is assigned to each Finding based on the size and nature of the 
deviation from FHA requirements. Severity tiers indicate whether a lender response is required in LRS.  
− Tier 1 and 2  Findings are unacceptable, requiring a lender response.  
• Lenders may rebut any unacceptable Finding by responding in LRS with supporting documentation.   
− Tier 3 and 4  Findings are deficient and do not impact a loan’s eligibility for FHA insurance.  
• These Findings do not require a lender response, but optional responses can be submitted in LRS.

Last Revised : 10/31 /2023  III. REMEDIES  
Potential remedies described below are applicable for Findings identified in the Loan Review System (LRS).   
− Life-of-Loan Indemnification is the only remedy available for tier 1 Findings.   
− Alternatives to Indemnification may be available for tier 2 Findings; they are shown in each defect area as a 
waterfall  based on degree of impact.  
A) Mitigating Documentation  
Findings in any defect area may be mitigated with the lender’s submission of additional documentation which 
adequately addresses the source and cause of the Finding.  
B) Financial Remediation   
Certain Findings may be remedied by a financial adjustment in the amount of the violation and the lender’s 
submission of documentation showing completion of the corrective action.  
− A refund  must be made to the party affected by the violation.  
− A principal reduction  must be applied to the existing principal loan balance; or for Delinquent  or Defaulted loans, 
may be applied to the Mortgagee’s suspense account.  
• When FHA insurance is terminated, and FHA has paid a termination claim, the required amount of financial 
remediation must be made to FHA via Claims Remittance.  
• When financial remediation cannot be completed due to foreclosure  status, or when an FHA claim has not yet 
been filed,  the Finding may be mitigated with the lender’s acknowledgement and agreement to make 
financial adjustments before or upon submission of an FHA claim.  
 C)  Indemnification  
In the absence of any alternative remedy, or when such alternatives have been exhausted, lenders must resolve 
unacceptable Findings by indemnifying HUD against the risk of financial losses by signing a 5 Year or Life -of-Loan 
Indemnification agreement as specified.  
− Indemnification agreements must be signed electronically in the Loan Review System by lender users with the 
“Indemnification Submission” role in FHA Connection.  
IV. FRAUD OR MISREPRESENTATION  
All Findings of fraud or materially misrepresented information are referred to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), 
regardless of LRS severity tier or remedy provided by the lender.  
A) Findings of fraud or materially misrepresented information can fall into one of two severity tiers:  
− Tier 1:  the lender knew or should have known.  
− Tier 4:  the lender did not know and could not have known.  
B) FHA determines if the lender knew or should have known based on whether:  
− an employee of the lender was involved and/or   
− red flags in the loan file should have been questioned by the underwriting lender.  
C) FHA’s loan review determinations regarding Findings of fraud or misrepresentation do not affect or override any 
separate determinations of the Office of the Inspector General through any audit or investigative process.

TOTAL ANNUAL LOAN COST RATE S (04/29/2024)  
a) Required tables. In calculating the total annual loan cost rates, creditors shall assume three 
loan periods, as determined by the following table.  
b) Loan periods.  
1) Loan Period 1 is a two -year loan period.  
2) Loan Period 2 is the life expectancy in years of the youngest Borrower to become 
obligated on the reverse mortgage loan, as shown in the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for

1).  
4) At the creditor’s option, an additional period may be included, which is the life 
expectancy figure in Loan Period 2, multiplied by 0.5 and rounded to the nearest full year 
(life expectancy figures at 0.5 have been rounded up to 1).
