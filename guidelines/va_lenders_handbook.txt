a. Which 
Publications 
Are Available 
Electronically? VA Pamphlet 26-7, VA Lender’s Handbook, along with H26-94-1, VA 
Servicing Guide, are now available elec tronically on the Internet.  Changes to 
the handbook and Servicing Guide will be  available on the Internet when 
signed.  Lenders are strongly encouraged to begin accessing these publications electronically.    Excerpts from certain Loan Guaranty circulars  beginning in 1996 are also 
available electronically.  Circulars contain inform ation about changes to VA 
policies and/or procedures and informa tion that regional o ffices are required 
to release to lenders and/or servicers in their area.  Circulars, which only 
discuss internal VA procedures, are not included. 
 
b. Internet 
Address The Internet address is: http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/pam26_7.html.   
 
c. Commercial 
Services There are also commercial services di stributing VA documents electronically.  
For example, the Mortgage Resource Center (800-848-4904)  offers them on 
diskettes for those without access to the Internet as we ll as over the Internet 
(http://www.allregs.com ).  They can notify lenders  by electronic mail when 
lender’s handbook chan ges or circulars are issued.

CI-3 2.  Misleading Advertisements 
 
Changed Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been chan ged to create subsection letterin g.  
 
a. Policy The Department of Veterans Affairs alwa ys strives to provide all veterans the 
most up-to-date and pertinent informati on about their benefits.  Toward that 
end, all appropriate efforts by lenders to  further educate or  remind veterans 
about their home loan benefit and the lende r’s availability to assist the veteran 
in obtaining the benefit is appreciated.  However, it is inappropriate to direct 
any information about benefits to vete rans which is in any way misleading. 
 It must be clearly understood that VA has a very specific mission to serve 
veterans, who are declared by Congress to be a “special cla ss of citizen,” and 
veterans rely on VA to provide dependa ble service and reli able information 
concerning their benefits.    Any action on the part of lenders or  other program pa rticipants which 
jeopardizes VA’s credibility with veterans  or induces veterans to obtain loans 
which are clearly not in their best inte rests would be viewed by VA as actions 
which are detrimental to the best interest s of veterans.  If such a determination 
is made, grounds for suspension from participation in the VA Loan Guaranty Pro
gram could be established. 
 
b. Examples Example 1 : 
 In increasing numbers, VA has been rece iving inquiries and complaints from 
veterans concerning advertisements and solicitations they have received from 
lenders which state that VA has a new program to refinance their VA loan 
and lower their interest rate, an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL).    The IRRRL program has been available to veterans since the enactment of 
The Veterans’ Disability Compensati on and Housing Benefits Amendments 
of 1980 ( Public Law 96-385 ).   
 
In addition, many of these solicitation s suggest that the lender has some 
special relationship with VA that enables only them to offer this loan 
opportunity.  Some even clearly attemp ts to give the impression that the 
“letter” the veteran received came from VA.

CI-4 2.  Misleading Advertisements, Continued 
  
b. Examples 
(continued)  Example 2 : 
Another unacceptable advertising approach that some lenders have been using is to invite veterans to “skip” payments  and refinance their loan.  It generally 
gives the appearance that VA condones sk ipping payments and rolling them 
into the new IRRRL. This is not the case.    It is irresponsible to s uggest to any mortgagor that  this program encourages 
skipping payments, or that this is an  appropriate means of getting around the 
prohibition against receiving cash from the transaction.   
 Any advertising that promotes skippi ng payments as a means of obtaining 
cash for other purposes is unacceptable. 
 
c. Lender 
Responsibility VA encourages all lenders to continue offering VA financi ng to all eligible 
and qualified veterans, and it is r ecognized that mortgage lending is a 
competitive industry.  However, VA insi sts that lenders refrain from any and 
all practices which might mislead veterans  into actions which are contrary to 
their own best interests.    If your firm has been engaging in such advertising, or is considering doing so, 
VA strongly recommends that  anything in your promoti onal material which is 
in any way inaccurate or misleading be deleted.  If there is uncertainty about 
the accuracy or propriety of the adver tisement or solicitation, please consult 
with the appropriate local VA office or  the Loan Policy staff at VA Central 
Office at (202) 273-7368. 
 
d. Sanctions Sanctions of program participants for viol ations of regulations  are set forth in 
38 CFR part 44 .   Refer to Chapter 17  for additional info rmation on sanctions 
of program participants.

CI-5 3.  Automated Underwriting 
 
Changed Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to  create subsec tion lettering. 
 Subsection a has been changed to ad d a reference to the Zippy program. 
 Subsection c’s reference to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s automated 
underwriting systems has been changed to “provider of these systems.”  
This chan ge is due to the increase in the number of approved s ystems. 
 
a. General VA has approved the use of several au tomated underwriting systems.  The 
systems are  
 Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector , 
 Fannie Mae’s DU , 
 Countrywide’s CLUES System , and 
 Chase’s Zippy  
 
Note :  The Chase and Countrywide system s may only be used in connection 
with their loans.  
 The systems are only for use by VA automatic lenders, and only on loans 
eligible for automa tic processing.   
 These systems assign a risk classifica tion which determines the level of 
underwritin
g and documentation needed. 
 
b. Lender 
Responsibility The automated systems do not approve or  disapprove loans.   They merely 
determine a risk classifica tion.  It is still the lende r’s decision whether or not 
to approve the loan.    Lenders are still responsible for meeting all VA requirements for all  loans; 
however they may take advantage of certain documentation waivers based on 
the risk classification. 
 
c. VA’s Role Although VA has approved the use of thes e systems, we are not the vendor. 
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these s ystems.

CI-6 4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 
 
Changed Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been chan ged to create subsection letterin g.  
 
a. 
Compatibility 
of VA Program 
with HMDA As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  (HMDA) data, 
many lenders are increasingl y concerned that they ar e taking all appropriate 
measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to home mortgage loans.  VA believes that  it is important for lenders to be 
aware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in 
meeting this goal.  The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-m oderate incomes.  Howe ver, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such applicants.  The “VA Credit St andards” are written as guidelines and 
are meant to be interprete d and used just that way,  taking into consideration 
all of an individual loan applicant’ s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.    This topic provides guidance on area s of underwriting that may be of 
particular concern when processing app lications for low-to-moderate income 
borrowers.  Many of the concepts are discussed in Chapter 4 , Credit 
Underwriting, but are repeated here to emphasize their importance and 
applicability to underwriti ng loans to minority and low-to-moderate income 
applicants. 
 
b. Purpose This topic in the “VA Lender's Ha ndbook” is intended to encourage 
underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be 
approved but may not appear  approvable upon direct a pplication of the credit 
standards.  The examples discussed are certainly not all in clusive, but they 
should help the underwriter recognize th at there are those whose lifestyle, 
minority status, or location require cons ideration of extraordinary, yet valid, 
factors in the underwriting process in order to find a ba sis for correctly 
making an approval decision.  Underwriters are encouraged to gi ve consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in se eking a proper basis for a pproving loan applications 
for ever
y qualified veteran.

c. Use of VA 
Prior Approval 
Procedure Although lenders that have automatic au thority should use that authority to 
the maximum extent possible, another important tool available to lenders 
seeking to increase credit access by minor ity and lower income borrowers is 
the optional use of VA’s prio r-approval processing.   
 Loan applications that may not be  clearly approvable under VA’s published 
credit standards but which, in the lender’s view, contain compensating 
strengths, may be sent to VA on the pr ior-approval basis.  Lenders should 
submit an explanation as to why the lo an was not closed automatically and 
point out the reasons wh
y they believe the loan ma y be approvable. 
 
d. Employment 
and Income 
Stability A borrower’s employment and income st ability are vital to the underwriting 
of a loan.  There are characteristics  that should be considered when 
underwriting loans for low-to-moderate  income borrowers when evaluating 
acceptable employment and income.  Changing of Jobs  
It is possible to establish stable  and reliable income without having 
established a stable empl oyment history in one position or job.  It is not 
unusual for some borrowers to  change jobs frequently, even changing lines of 
work.  The borrower may be simply going where there is available work.  To 
establish stability and co ntinuance of income, the borrower must demonstrate 
the ability to maintain an income at a constant level over the recent 2-year 
period even if he or she has wo rked for a variety of employers. 
 Part-Time Employment  
It is not uncommon for people with limited income from their primary 
employment to take on part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Ideally 
the borrower should show a two-year hist ory, but one year may be considered 
for an otherwise strong borrower.  Underw riters must review such income for 
probable continuance and tr y to assure that the part-time employment is 
reasonable and sustainable.

d. Employment 
and Income 
Stability (continued)  Periods of Unemployment  
In parts of the country, it is not unus ual for some indivi duals to work for 
certain times of the year and draw unemployment for the remainder of the 
year (such as field workers).  A peri od or periods of une mployment will not 
automatically be considered unfavor ably, provided the unemployment is 
regular and seasonal, or is a li mited occurrence between jobs, and 
unemployment compensation has been r eceived during those periods.  If the 
applicant has a history of such an income pattern, unemployment 
compensation as well as income receiv ed during periods of employment may 
be used when calculatin g an individual’s income for loan approval purposes. 
  
e. Source of 
Funds to Close Another area where low-to-moderate income borrowers sometimes differ 
from others is the source of funds to close loans.  It is not unusual or 
unacceptable for some borrowers to save money at home versus using depositories.  In order to be acceptable,  a reasonable explanation of how the 
borrower saved the funds should be provided. 
 
f. Credit 
History In the area of credit, the lack of an established credit history should not be a 
deterrent to loan approval.  As provided in the credit standards, a satisfactory 
payment history on items such as rent, util ities, phone bills, etc., may be used 
to establish a satisfactor y credit histor y.

g. Consider All 
Factors As stated in the credit standards, no  single factor is a determinant in any 
applicant’s qualification fo r a VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
 A veteran who has maintained an ex cellent credit history, (such as 
satisfactory payment of a shelter ex pense comparable to the proposed 
shelter expense) may be approvable in  spite of shortfall in the residual 
income.  In such an instance, it might  be appropriate to consider that the 
veteran has established a lifestyle which is substantially different from the average used in establishing the residual income tables in the credit standards. 
 A veteran with a good credit record who meets the residual income 
guideline (without exceeding it by 20 per cent) may be appr ovable in spite 
of a high debt-to-income ratio if the proposed shelter expense is not 
significantly greater than the amount th e veteran has been accustomed to 
paying. 
 
h. 
Compensating Factors The use of compensating factors is en couraged for marginally approvable VA 
loans, and a detailed explanation of  their use in underwriting loans is 
provided in the credit standards.    A compensating factor that has come into  play quite recently is the numerous 
financial and homeownership coun seling programs being provided by a 
variety of sources including banks, mo rtgage lenders, and community groups.  
These counseling programs are designed to  help applicants work out payment 
plans for old debts, design savings pl ans, and teach basic budgeting skills.  
Programs often include homebuyer e ducation lessons and post-closing 
counseling to assist the new homeowners once the loan is made.  Participation 
by an applicant in such a counseling program can be viewed as a strong 
compensating factor for a case in which it is otherwise difficult to conclude 
that a borrower is qualified under a trad itional interpretati on of the credit 
standards.

Changed Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to  create subsec tion lettering.  
 Subsection a has been created by comb ining the two previous subsections 
into one.  This new subsection encour ages lenders to use their automatic 
authority in every possible instance before submitting a loan to VA for 
underwritin g. 
 
a. Use of Prior 
Approval Processing by Automatic Lenders Lenders with automatic authority must use their automatic authority in every 
possible instance before submitting a lo an to VA for underwriting on the prior 
approval basis.   
 Except for cases specifica lly precluded from automa tic processing, such as 
joint loans, the only cases lenders should consider  submitting to VA for prior 
approval are those in which the underwr iter firmly believes approval can be 
justified.  However, the specific facts of the case appear to preclude approval.  
In such instances, the underwriter must include:  
 a detailed explanation of why the lo an should be approved by VA, plus 
 a thorough justification for not approving the loan on the automatic basis.   
 It will not be sufficient to justify submitting the loan to VA solely to comply 
with the veteran’s or the real estate a
gent’s request to do so.

Changed Date September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been chan ged to create subsection letterin g.  
 
a. Paperless 
Guaranty 
Processing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) enables participating lenders to 
electronically submit a loan to VA for guaranty AND  receive an 
electronically generated Loan Guaranty Certificate (LGC). 
 Lenders benefit from this type of processing in many ways, including: 
 Quicker receipt of the LGC (48 hour turn around) 
 No need to mail a paper package (unless selected for an audit review) 
 Ability to submit loans for guaranty virtually anytime 
 No need to complete the VA Form 26-0286, Loan Summary Sheet  
 Ability to deliver final documents to i nvestors quickly, enabling investors to 
purchase pool loans faster which reduces costs of carr ying the loan.  
 
b. Electronic 
Data 
Interchange for Small and Medium Sized Lenders C.C. Pace Systems, a technology consu lting firm specializing in business 
solutions for the mortgage industry co llaborated with VA to develop Loan 
Guaranty Express (LGXpress).  LGXpress is easy to implement and ca n offer time-saving and money-saving 
process improvements for some small to medium sized lenders.

Change Date February 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. Lender Any person or entity (private sector or government) that originates, holds, 
services, funds, bu ys, sells or otherwise transfers a loan guaranteed b y VA. 
  
b. Supervised 
Lender A lender that is subject to mandatory periodic examinati on and supervision by 
an agency of the United States or of  any State or terr itory, including the 
District of Columbia.  VA determines whether the level of examination and supervision to which a lender is subject satisfies the requirement.  Examples of supervised lenders include:

Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration 
(NCUA), 
 Financial institutions which are members of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, 
 Federal Savings Banks, 
 National Banks, 
 Farm Credit System Institutions, 
 State Chartered Banks, 
 Insurance Companies, 
 Credit Unions, 
 Savings and Loan Associations, and

c. Non-
supervised Lender Any lender that is not a supervised lender.  
  
d. Non- 
supervised Automatic Lender A lender who has applied for authority to close loans on an automatic basis 
and has been formally gran ted such authority by VA. 
  
e. Agent An Agent may also be referred to as a Mortgage Broker. An Agent is a person 
or entity that performs any activity on behalf of , or in the name of, a 
sponsorin g lender.   
  
f. Sponsoring 
Lender A lender that uses an agent to perform any portion of the work involved in 
originating and closing a VA-guaranteed loan is the “sponsoring lender” for 
that a gent. 
  
g. Mergers and 
Acquisitions Lender mergers and acquisitions are disc ussed in section 8 of this chapter. 
 
h. Prior 
Approval A Prior Approval lender is neither a s upervised or non-supervised automatic 
lender.  All prior approval loans must  be submitted to VA for underwriting 
and approval prior to closing the loan.  
 All lenders, whether or not th ey have automatic authority, must  submit the 
following types of loans to  VA for prior approval: 
 
 Joint loans (Veteran/Veteran  or Veteran/non-Veteran). 
 Loans to Veterans in receipt of  VA nonservice-connected pension. 
 Loans to Veterans with a VA appointed fiduciary.  
 Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs) made to refinance 
delinquent VA loans. 
 Manufactured home loans (except when the manufactured home is 
permanently affixed to the lot and considered real estate under state law) 
unless the lender has been separate ly approved for this purpose. 
 Unsecured loans or loans secured b
y less than a first lien.

h. Prior 
Approval, continued Lenders with automatic authority may also elect  to submit a loan (of a type 
not on the above list) for pr ior approval when issues or circumstances cannot 
be resolved by the lend er’s own underwriting st aff (see section 5 of Current 
Issues ). 
 
 The submission must include the underwr iter’s analysis a nd explanation of 
why it is being submitte d for prior approval.  
 Do not use this provision to shift the burden of a loan rejection to VA. 
 
Lenders without automatic authority must submit a ll loans to VA for prior 
approval except IRRRLs made to refinance VA loans that are not delinquent. 
 
i. Automatic 
Authority  (Authority to 
Close Loans on 
an Automatic Basis) Automatic authority is authority for a lender to close VA-guaranteed loans 
without the prior approval of VA.  Le nders with automatic authority should 
use it to the maximum extent possible.  The following lenders have automatic 
authority:  
 all supervised lenders, 
 certain non-supervised lenders who a pply for and are gr anted automatic 
authority by VA, and 
 any lender (even a lender who does not otherwise have automatic authority) 
for the limited purpose of closing an  IRRRL, as long as the loan being 
refinanced is not delinquent.

j. Supervised 
Versus Non-supervised Automatic Lenders A non-supervised lender that wishes to close loans on an automatic basis must 
obtain both VA authorization for auto matic authority and obtain VA approval 
of other elements of its automatic lending operations (that is, underwriter 
approval).  This difference between supe rvised and non-supervised lenders is 
outlined below.  
Authority Supervised Lender Non-supervised Automatic 
Lender 
To close loans on the automatic 
basis No VA approval needed. Must submit application and be 
authorized by VA to close loans on an automatic basis. 
To use certain underwriters No VA approval needed.  
Any of the lender’s 
underwriters may underwrite loans processed on the automatic basis. Must submit application and 
obtain VA approval for each person to underwrite VA loans processed on the automatic basis. 
To close loans in particular states  No VA approval needed. 
Lender may close loans in any state.  No VA approval needed. Lender 
may close loans in any state.   
To use agents to process VA loans Must submit request and 
obtain VA recognition of each agent with whom the lender has an on
going relationship. Must submit request and obtain 
VA recognition of each agent with whom the lender has an ongoing relationship.  
 
 
k. IRRRL 
Exception IRRRLs, except those intended to refi nance delinquent VA loans, can be 
closed automatically by any lender in any state w ithout specific approval of 
automatic authority, underwriters, or the state in which the loan is made.  Use 
of agents to process IRRRLs is subjec t to the same requi rements as agents 
processin g other t ypes of loans (see Topic 7 of this chapte r).

a. Sending the 
Initial 
Information 
Package to VA This section applies to all lenders (s upervised, non-supervis ed automatic, and 
prior approval). 
 First-time VA lenders must send the certain information to the VA Regional 
Loan Center (RLC) or the Honol ulu Regional Office according to 
jurisdiction.  A complete  list may be found at: 
http://www.benefits.va.gov/hom eloans/contact_rlc_info.asp . The information 
that should be sent includes:  
 specimen signatures of all officers,  underwriters, or other personnel 
authorized to sign documents relate d to VA-guaranteed loan activities, 
 VA Form 26-8812 , VA Equal Opportunity Lender Certification , and 
 a letter identifying the lender’s corpor ate address, the le nder’s owners, any 
lending personnel or officers that VA or HUD ever debarred or took other 
adverse action against, and a list of all the lender’s branch offices that are 
involved in VA mortgage lending. 
 In addition, VA may, at its discretion, or der a credit report on  a lender and/or 
interview principal officers.

b. What 
Happens Next? The VA RLC of jurisdiction will provide information to the lender, including 
training on VA loan processing, and a VA ID number to use for all VA 
lending transactions and documents as  an identifier of the lender. 
 The lender may download a copy of this VA Pamphlet 26-7, Lender’s 
Handbook, at http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/pam26_7.html . 
 To receive new lender information from  the VA, including updates to this 
manual, the lender will need to  sign up for GovDelivery at 
https://public.govdelivery.c om/accounts/USVAVBA/subs criber/new?preferen
ces=true.  
 The VA RLC of jurisdiction will serve as the lender’s primary contact point with VA.  Please direct all  technical questions, re quests for training, or 
requests for VA publications and materials to that office. 
 As soon as a lender becomes familia r with the laws, regulations, and 
procedures pertaining to VA-guarant eed loans, it may begin making VA 
loans.  A non-supervised lender must submit a ll loans except certain IRRRLs to VA 
for prior approval, unless the lender  applies for, and receives, specific 
authority from VA to close loans on the automatic basis.  A lender supervised by one of the Federal entities described in Topic 3 of this 
chapter can begin closing loans on the automatic basis immediately. 
 A lender that must submit a request to VA for recognition as supervised must 
submit all loans except certain IRRRLs to VA for prior approval until it receives recognition as supervised. S ee Topic 3 of this chapter for more 
information.

Change Date February 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Supervision 
by Certain Federal Entities VA considers any lender subject to mandatory periodic examination and 
supervision by any of the following Fe deral entities to be supervised: 
 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 The Comptroller of the Currency 
 The National Credit Union Administration 
 The Farm Credit Administration 
 
Lenders supervised by these Federal en tities are not required to request 
recognition from VA.  Indicate which of the above  Federal entities supervises  the lender in the initial 
information package submitted to VA.  If VA needs clarification of the lender’s status, VA will request appropriate documentation from the lender. 
 
b. 
Circumstances 
under which VA 
Recognition as Supervised is Needed These instructions apply to a lender that wishes to be recognized as a 
supervised lender by VA, but is not directly supervised by one of the Federal entities listed in Topic 3, Subsection a, of this chap ter.  In such cases, the 
lender must request that VA specifically  recognize it as supervised and must 
be a wholly owned subsidiary or af filiate of a VA recognized supervised 
lender.     The relationship between a wholly-owned  subsidiary or affiliate of a VA-
recognized supervised lender and that supervised lender is to be the basis for 
recognition as supervised, documentation of the structure, capitalization, and 
ownership of the subsidiary or affiliat e and its legal/financial relationship to 
the supervised lender must be submitte d to the VA office with jurisdiction 
over the lender’s home office.  VA will inform the lender of its decision b
y letter.

 3.  Lenders That are Considered Supervised, continued 
  
d. If a Lender is 
Supervised A supervised lender has the authorit y to close VA-guaranteed loans on an 
automatic basis (without the prior approva l of VA) except for certain types of 
loans that must be submitted to VA for prior approval by all lenders. 
 These loan types are listed in Topic 1 of  this chapter under “Prior Approval.” 
 The supervised lender must obtain VA rec ognition of agents it uses to make 
VA loans. See Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. 
 
If the lender uses an agent, it must s ubmit the following to the VA office with 
jurisdiction over its home office by January 31 of each year:  
 a list of the VA-recognized agency re lationships it wishes to renew, 
 the annual renewal fee (see Topic 10 of  this chapter) for each lender agent 
that acts for the lender and had been  recognized by VA as the lender’s agent 
as of September 30 (120 days before payment is due), and 
 any other informati on requested by VA. 
 Although VA offices may issue an annual reminder notice to lenders that the 
above information is due, lenders bear  the ultimate res ponsibility for timely 
submission of the information and appropr iate fees.  Failure to pay annual 
renewal fees could result in loss of a lender’s automatic processin
g authorit y.

approved or rejected by a VA-approved underwriter.  
 
A VA-approved underwriter must sign a VA Form 26-6393 , Loan Analysis , 
on each loan to certify his or her review  of such loan. An electronic signature 
is acceptable.  The lender may request approval of additi onal underwriters at  any time after

Underwriter Approval or Approv al to Close Loans involving 
an Affiliate, continued 
  
a. Underwriter 
Approval, 
continued VA underwriter training is required of all underwriters whether approved 
based on experience or based on an AMP or CRU designation.  It is also 
required of underwriters who have not  underwritten VA-guaranteed loans in 
the past 24 months.  Underwriters who consistently approve loans that do not 
meet VA credit standards will be requ ired to retake this training. 
 VA approval of an underwriter is automati cally terminated (without notice) if 
the underwriter is no longer employe d by the same lender.  The lender must  
report any such circumstances to VA.  The lender may  not continue to close loans automatically without a  
VA-approved underwriter. 
  
b. Approval to 
Close Loans Involving an 
Affiliate The lender may request VA approval to cl ose loans involving an affiliate on 
an automatic basis (“affilia te” as used here includes a real estate brokerage 
firm and/or residential builder or de veloper that the le nder has a financial 
interest in, owns, is owned by, or is affi liated with).  The lender may request 
such approval at the time it applies for automatic authority or any time thereafter.  Submit the request to th e VA office with jurisdiction over the 
lender’s home office along with a cor porate resolution fro m the lender and 
each affiliate indicating they are separa te entities operating independently of 
each other.   The lender’s corporate resolution must indicate that it will not give more 
favorable underwriting considera tion to its affiliate’s loans. 
 The affiliate’s corporate resolution must  indicate that it will not seek to

Requests VA Recognition of an Agent  
 
Change Date February 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. Limitations 
on Use of Agents A lender must request VA recognition of an ongoing relationship with an 
agent.  The lender may designate any i ndividual or entity as an agent to 
perform loan-related functions on its behalf or in its name. 
 The extent of the relationship between the lender and the agent is at the lender’s discretion and the following le nder responsibilities  must be met: 
 
 The lender must  accept  full responsibility for the acts, erro rs, or omissions 
of the agent in processing  and/or closing loans. 
 The lender accepts this res ponsibility by certification on VA Form 26-1820 , 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement , and the corporate 
resolution. 
 The lender may not subsequently claim that  it should not be held 
accountable for inaccurate or fraudulen t credit information or other loan 
data because it relied on the agent. 
 Irregularities resulting from acts or omis sions of the agent are treated as acts 
or omissions of the lender . 
 The lender’s use of an agent will not prevent VA from taking actions in 
appropriate cases such as denial of liability, claim adjustments, collection of 
the amount of any loss incurred due to irregularities, and imposition of 
sanctions against both th e lender and the agent. 
 If the lender is a non-supervised automa tic lender, loans made by an agent on 
its behalf which are closed automatically  must be reviewed and approved by a 
VA-approved underwriter emplo
yed by the lender.

b. How to 
Request VA Recognition of an Agent To begin a relationship with an agent, submit a request fo r recognition of the 
agent relationship to the VA office with  jurisdiction over the lender’s home 
office.  Include a corporate resolution which contains:  
 the agent’s  name, address, telephone, e-mail address, and Federal Tax ID 
number, 
 the agent’s function(s) (such as, taki ng the loan application, ordering the 
credit report and verifications of employment and deposit, holding 
settlement), 
 a statement that the lender takes full responsibility for all acts, errors, or 
omissions of the agent and its employees, and 
 if the agent will enter into interest rate lock-in agreements on the lender’s 
behalf, a statement that the lender will honor the lock-in. 
 
Note :  A conditional loan purchase agreement, wherein the lender agrees only 
to purchase the agent’s production su bject to the lender’s review and 
approval, is unacceptable.  Also include a fee of $100 for each agent with the request.  
 The lender may begin to use an agen t after VA sends recognition of the 
relationship to the lender in writing.  Even with formal VA recognition, the 
lender must  identify the agent and its function on VA Form 26-1820, Report 
and Certi
fication o f Loan Disbursement,  for each loan.

g. When Can 
an Agent Close Loans Automatically? If the lender has automatic authority, its  agent can close loans automatically 
on its behalf.  This can be done to th e extent the loans could be closed 
automatically if made by the le nder, provided VA requirements for 
recognition of an agency re lationship and reporting it on VA Form 26-1820, 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement,  have been complied with. 
 If the lender is a non-supervised automati c lender, this mean s all loans must 
be reviewed and approved by a VA-a pproved underwriter employed by the 
lender.  Exception :  The underwriter’s certi fication must appear on VA Form 26-
6393 , Loan Analysis , as required for VA loans cl osed on the automatic basis 
that do not involve a
gents. 
  
h. Prior 
Approval Lenders If the lender does not have automatic aut hority, they may not use the services 
of an agent.  Follow prior approval pr ocedures in Chapter 5 of this handbook.

 8.  Mergers and Acquisitions Involving Supervised or Non-
supervised Automatic Lenders 
  
Change Date February 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. The Issue Changes in ownership or corporate structure of a lender may impact its 
continued qualifications for automati c authority.  Lenders must notify VA 
whenever a merger, acquisition, or cha nge in the ownership of the lender 
occurs, so that VA can evaluate any imp act on the lender’s pa rticipation in the 
VA Home Loan program.   Although only the terms “merger” and “acquisition” and “selling,” 
“acquiring” or “surviving” entities are us ed in this paragraph, the concepts 
and procedures in this paragraph apply to  every type of rest ructuring that has 
a significant impact on an organization’s ownership, structure,  or assets, and 
so on.

b. Required 
Submissions Whenever a supervised or non-supervised   lender with auto matic authority is 
involved in a merger or acquisition, it must submit a $100 processing fee 
along with the following information to  the RLC with jurisdiction over its 
home office:  
 the names  of the acquiring and selling enti ties, and the surviving entity. 
 the information listed in Topic 2, Subsection a, of this chapter for the 
surviving entity. 
 a general description of the assets  being acquired in the merger or 
acquisition. 
 the addresses of all branch offices an d their current VA ID numbers that are 
involved in VA mortgage lending, and whether they will continue to 
operate or be closed.  
 a list of agents and their VA ID numbers  that will be used by the surviving 
entity and have already been recognized by  VA as agents of the selling or 
acquiring entities.  Requ ests for recognition of new agents  may accompany 
the submission along with appropriate fees and corporate resolutions. See 
Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. 
 
Note :  Any of these items that remain unchanged do not have to be 
resubmitted; simply indicat e that they are unchanged. 
Questions about merger or acquisition transactions s hould be sent to the RLC 
of jurisdiction.  Since each merger or  acquisition is unique, VA may discover 
that it needs to request additional information from the lender during its review.  Lenders with ques tions may send an e-mail to

 9.  Withdrawal of Automatic Authority from Supervised or 
Non-supervised Automatic Lenders 
   
Change Date February 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. General VA can withdraw a lender’s automatic au thority for proper cause, after giving 
the lender 30 days notice. This applie s to both supervised and non-supervised 
lenders.  VA regulations at 38 CFR 36.4349  provide the framework.  The 
lender may continue processing loans on a prior approval basis after its 
automatic authority has been withdrawn.  The remainder of this Topic gives the reasons a lender’s automatic authority can be withdrawn, and the correspondi ng period for which the withdrawal 
will be effective.  
  
b. Withdrawal 
for an Indefinite Period Withdrawal for an indefinite period ca n be based on any of the following: 
 Failure to continue meeti ng basic qualifying criteria: 
 
 For supervised lenders, this includes lo ss of status as an entity subject 
to examination and supervision by a Federal or State regulatory 
agency.  
 For non-supervised lenders, this  includes no approved underwriter, 
failure to maintain $50,000 worki ng capital or $250,000 adjusted net 
worth, and/or failure to file th e required financial statements.  
 Any of the causes for debarment set forth in 38 CFR 44 . 
 During the probationary period for newl y-approved non-supervised automatic 
lenders, automatic authority may be withdrawn for poor underwriting 
consistently careless processing, failure to provide loan files timely, or to 
provide other necessar
y documents as requested b y VA.

d. Withdrawal 
for 180 Days Withdrawal for 180 days can be based on any of the following: 
 
 Loans conflict with VA credit standards and would not have been made by a

material to the Veteran’s ability to repay the loan that  undue risk to the 
Government results. 
 Employment or deposit veri fications are hand carried  by the applicant or 
otherwise mishandled, resulting in su bmission of significant misinformation 
to VA. 
 Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA 
requirements to Veterans to the detriment of their interests. 
 
Examples : 
  The Veteran was dissuaded from seek ing a lower interest rate based on 
lender’s incorrect advice that su ch options were excluded by VA  
requirements. 
 Closing documents show instances of  improper charges to Veteran after 
the impropriety of such charges are ca lled to lender’s attention by VA, or 
the lender refuses to refund such  charges after notification by VA. 
 Other instances of lender actions prejudi cial to the interests of Veterans 
such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings. 
 
 
e. Withdrawal 
for 1 to 3 Years
 Withdrawal for 1 to 3 years can be based on any of the following: 
 
 Failure to properly disburse loans, su ch as loan disbursement checks are 
returned due to insufficient funds. 
 
 Involvement by the lender in the impr oper use of a Veteran’s entitlement, 
such as knowingly permitting the Veteran to violate occupancy 
requirements. 
 
 Lender involvement in the Veteran’s sa le of entitlement to a third party, 
such as a lender makes the loan with  the knowledge that the Veteran is not 
purchasing the property to be his or he r home.  Instead, the Veteran intends 
to transfer title to a third part y who assumes the loan shortl y after closin g.

accidental overpayment).  
 Pay all fees by lender’s check to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
 If an agent, underwriter, or SAR appr oved by VA for a role with one lender 
begins work for another lender, the ne w lender must request and pay the fee 
for a new VA reco
gnition or approval of that individual.

Change Date February 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Method Net worth for VA purposes is determined b y 38 C.F.R. §36.4352(b)(4)(ii).  
   
b. CPA 
Requirement Adjusted net worth must be calcu lated by a CPA using an audited  and 
certified balance sheet from the lender’s  latest financial statement, per the 
above re gulation. 
  
c. Calculation Adjusted net worth is total assets, minus total liabilities, minus  the following 
unacceptable assets: 
 Any assets of the lender pledged to s ecure obligations of another person or 
entity. 
 Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related 
entities, in which the lender’s office rs or stockholders have a personal 
interest, unrelated to thei r position as an officer or stockholder.  Personal 
interest indicates a relationship between the lender and a pe rson or entity in 
which that specified person has a financ ial interest in or is employed in a 
management position by the lender. 
 Any investment in related entities in which the lender’s officers or 
stockholders (or their family members) ha ve a personal intere st unrelated to 
their position as an of ficer or stockholder. 
 That portion of an investment in jo int ventures, subsid iaries, affiliates 
and/or other related entities, which is carried at a value greater than equity, 
as adjusted (“equity, as adjusted” mean s the book value of the related entity 
reduced by the amount of unacceptable asse ts carried by the related entity). 
 All intangibles, such as goodwill, covena nts not to compete, franchisee fees, 
organization costs, and so on, except una mortized servicing costs carried at 
a value established by an arm’s-leng th transaction and presented in 
accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles. 
 That portion of an asset not readily  marketable and for which appraised 
values are very subjective carried at a value in excess of a substantially 
discounted appraised value.  Assets such as antiques, art work, and gemstones are subject to th is provision and should be carried at the lower of 
cost or market. 
 Any asset that is principally used for th e personal enjoyment of an officer or 
stockholder and not for normal business purposes.

Lender’s Role The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) issued in WebLGY is the proof of 
eligibility for the lender.  The lender must ensure the applicant is an  eligible Veteran before an appraisal 
is ordered, the loan cannot be proc essed or closed.  Lenders should never  
close a loan before they establish el igibility. VA cannot guarantee a loan for 
an ineligible Veteran.    Once a COE is issued there may be cond itions on the COE which must be met 
in order to receive a guaranty.  The c onditions that could appear on the COE 
are:  
 Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) - Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of th is certificate.  A certification of 
continuous active duty as of date of  note is required. This COE is not 
valid if the ADSM was discharged afte r the date of the certificate. In 
this instance, a new COE must be obtained.   
 Funding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937  to the Regional 
Loan Center (RLC) of Jurisdiction.  Please have the lender contact the 
RLC for loan processing. 
 Funding Fee – Veteran is not exem pt from funding fee due to non-
service connected pension.  Loan  application will require prior 
approval processing by VA.  
 Reserve or National Guard Member  – Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous service in the Selected Re serve or National Guard as of the 
date of the note is required.

continued  
 
b. The 
Lender’s Role, continued   Reserve/National Guard Funding Fee – Entitlement is based on service 
in the Selected Reserve and/or Nati onal Guard so an increased funding 
fee is required. 
 Refinance Restoration – Restored entitlement previ ously used or 
charged for a VA Loan Indetification Number (LIN) as shown here is 
available only for use in connecti on with the property which secured 
that loan. 
 One-Time Restoration – Entitlement previously used for a VA LIN has 
been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38 
U.S.C. 3702 (b)(4) .  Any future restoration requires disposal of all 
property obtained with a VA loan.  
 Subsequent Use Funding Fee – Enti tlement code of “5” indicates 
previously used entitlement has been  restored.  The Veteran must pay a 
subsequent use funding fee on any fu ture loan unless the Veteran is 
exempt. 
 Surviving Spouse – Eligibility of th e surviving spouse and the validity 
of guaranty entitlement hereby evidenced will be null and void if any 
change in marital status occurs, subs equent to the date of this COE and 
prior to the date a loan to the wi dow or widower is closed, unless the 
lender making the loan was not aware of any change in marital status 
and obtained on the date the loan clos ed an affidavit from the surviving 
spouse in the form pres cribed by the Secretary.  
 Prisoner of War/Missing in Acti on (POW/MIA) – This certificate 
evidences eligibility under 38 U.S.C 3701 (b)(3)  of the individual 
named as the spouse of a Servicemem ber missing in action or prisoner 
of war.  Any unused entitlement wi ll terminate automatically upon the 
receipt of official no tice that the Servicemem ber is no longer in a 
category specified in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(3)  or upon dissolution of 
marriage.  
 Paid-in-Full Loan – Entitlement char ged on a paid-in-full loan cannot 
be restored until the Veteran applies fo r restoration of entitlement.  The 
lender shall submit the applica tion electronically through VA’s 
Automated Certificate of Eligib ility (ACE) online application. 
 Foreclosed Loan – Entitlement char ged on a foreclosed loan cannot be 
restored until VA’s loss on the loan ha s been fully repa id.  Information 
about repayment of the loss may be  obtained by cont acting an RLC.

b. The 
Lenders Role, continued   
Although this chapter discusses some of the basic eligibility  criteria, it is not 
intended to provide a lender with all the knowledge necessary to make an 
eligibility determination; consequentl y, all the various exceptions and nuances 
of eligibility are not included.  Appe ndix 1-A at the end of this chapter 
provides a quick reference and overvie w of basic eligibility criteria. 
 Lenders must use VA’s ACE online app lication to obtain the COE. Go to 
VA’s Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications toolbar; then select Eligibility  and follow the prompts.   In many cases, a COE 
can be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders  should select the link to submit an 
electronic application.  Th is method allows lenders to upload supporting 
documentation and submit an application el ectronically to be processed by one 
of the RLCs.  A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at 
http://www.ebenefits.va.gov  or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26- 
1880 , Request for a Certificate of Eligibility  and mailing it to the listed RLC.  
Simultaneous applications may delay COE processing.  To ensure quicker 
responses, it is preferable to apply online. 
 
 
c. IRRRL 
Eligibility Determination  
VA systems will not generate a VA case number for an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL) if th ere is no record of an active VA 
loan.  This means if a lender successfu lly obtains a case nu mber for an IRRRL, 
a COE is not required.

 2. What the Certificate of  Eligibility Tells the Lender 
 
Change Date March 28, 2019 
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
 
a. Eligibility     b. Amount of Entitlement   
The lender may rely on a COE as proof th e Veteran is eligible for the home 
loan benefit.  Although elig ible for the home lo an benefit, Vete rans must still 
qualify based on income and credit be fore loan approval is granted. 
 
 
Entitlement is the amount available for use on a loan. The amount of basic 
entitlement is $36,000.  This may be reduced  if a Veteran has used entitlement 
before which has not been restored.  The amount of basic entitlement will be 
displayed near the center of the CO E. For example it may say:    
                                                        
“THIS VETERAN’S BASIC ENTITLEMENT IS $_________ .  TOTAL ENTITLEMENT CHARGE D TO PREVIOUS VA 
LOANS IS $_______ .” 
 
For loans greater than $144,000, bonus enti tlement may be available.  For 
loans greater than $144,000, but less than $484,350, the entitlement is 25 
percent.  For loans greater than $484,350, the maximum en titlement is 25 
percent of the loan limit, which can va ry by county. For a lis t of loan limits by 
county, visit  http://www.benefits.va.gov/ homeloans/lenders.a sp.  Please note 
county limits can change yearly.  VA w ill post the limits for each year on our 
website as they change. 
 
The Veteran may have entitlement for loans greater than $144,000, the COE does not reflect the bonus en titlement.  Instead, an asterisk 
by the word “available” refers to a no te, which explains the possibility of 
additional entitlement. 
 
If the Veteran previously used entitlement, which has not been restored, 
available entitlement is re duced by the amount used on the prior loan(s).  The 
lender has three options in this situation: 
 
 Make the loan knowing that VA’s guar anty is limited to the amount of 
available entitlement, or 
 Have the Veteran apply for restoratio n of previously used entitlement, 
or 
 The Veteran may provide a downpaym ent in conjunction with their 
remaining entitlement.

d. IRRRL Exemption Status  
The funding fee exemption status  on IRRRLs is displayed in  
WebLGY at the time the case number is ordered. 
 
 
e. Exempt Status and Verified Income  
Lenders may rely on the “exempt” status  appearing next to the “funding fee” 
field for verification of the funding fe e exemption.  If the dollar amount is 
different than what is shown on the CO E, use the most recent bank statement 
or award disability award letter for verification.  Additionally, on COEs with 
an “exempt” status, lenders may treat any service-conne cted disability income 
amount appearing in the “condition” secti on of the COE as verified income.  
There is no need to fax in VA Form 26- 8937 to confirm the status or amount 
showin
g on the COE. 
 
 
f. Additional Conditions Listed on Some COE Forms   
Additional conditions that th e lender and Veteran must comply with are listed 
on the COE, under the conditions headi ng.  The following table provides the 
actions a lender should take fo r each condition, if applicable: 
 
Conditions   What to Do  
Valid unless discharged or released 
subsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of c ontinuous active duty 
as of the date of note is required.  Ensure the Veteran is still on 
active duty before closing the loan. If the Veteran is discharged or  released prior to loan closing, request a  new COE and do not close the loan until  received. 
Excluded entitlement previously used for 
a VA LIN as shown herein is available only for use in c onnection with the 
property that secured that loan. If the entitlement used for the 
prior loan identified in this condition is needed for the proposed loan, ensure the proposed loan will be secured by the same property as the prior loan. (Cash-out refinance on a prior VA loan.)

g. The 
“Subsequent Use Funding Fee” Condition Conditions   What to Do  
Entitlement previously used for 
a VA LIN has been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38 U.S.C. 
3702(b)(4) .  Any future 
restoration requires disposal of all property or properties obtained with a VA loan.  The Veteran must have proof that all 
properties with VA-guaranteed loans have been disposed. 
The Veteran is not exempt from the funding fee due to receipt of non-service connected pension.  Loan application will require prior approval processing by VA.  Non service-connected pension must 
be submitted to VA for prior approval.  Concurrence is required from Pension Service, so allow extra time for processing.  
Funding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937  to the 
RLC of jurisdiction.  Please 
have the lender contact the RLC 
for loan processing. The Veteran has a fiduciary and the 
loan must be submitted to VA for prior approval. Concurrence is 
required from Fiduciary Service, so 
allow extra time for processing.  
  
 The “Subsequent Use Funding Fee” indi cates the Veteran has used their 
home loan benefit before, so a higher funding fee is required.

 3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility 
 
Change Date March 28, 2019  
This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. Procedures Lenders must first atte mpt to obtain a COE through the ACE application, 
which can be accessed through the VIP.    If a COE cannot be obtained immediately, lenders should sele ct the electronic 
application link that permits them to submit an electronic application.  If the 
COE is issued with reduced entitlemen t and restoration is needed, use the 
“Correct COE” function to request an updated COE.   
 The WebLGY system allows lenders to upload documentation, such as discharge papers or evidence to supp ort restoration (Closing Disclosure, 
HUD-1 etc.), along with the el ectronic application. Lenders should not  
upload scanned documents without first completing an elec tronic application. 
Using this feature, rather than mail,  is the preferred method, as it greatly 
reduces processing time.  
 Inability to obtain a COE in WebL GY does not mean the Veteran is 
ineligible, only that the system does  not have sufficient information to 
make an automatic determination.  Le nders should always continue the 
application process as described in the preceding paragraph. 
 Application for an Un married Surviving Spous es. A surviving spouse 
of a Veteran, who dies on activ e duty or from service-connected 
causes, may still be eligible for a COE.  If the surviving spouse is 
remarried on or after age 57, and on or after December 16, 2003, they still may be eligible.  Eligibility ma y also be granted to the spouse of 
an active duty member who is listed  as MIA or POW for at least 90 
days.  Eligibility under this MIA/PO W provision is limited to one-time 
use only.

 3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility, continued  
 
a. Procedures, 
continued  a) Surviving spouses of Veterans who died from non-service connected 
causes may also be eligible if a ny of the following conditions are 
met:  (1) the Veteran was rated tota lly disabled for 10 years or more 
immediately preceding death; or (2 ) was rated totally disabled for 
not less than 5 years from date of  discharge or release from active 
duty to date of death, or (3) th e Veteran was a former POW who 
died after September 30, 1999, and was rated totally disabled for not 
less than 1 year immediately preceding death. The above eligibility requirements are determined by VA Compensation Department.  Once completed, they will determine if the surviving spouse is eligible for qualifying Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC).  
b) If applying for the first time, su rviving spouses must complete VA 
Form 26-1817 , Request for Determination of Loan Guaranty 
Eligibility-Unmarried  Surviving Spouses , instead of VA Form 26-
1880 . 
c) Both the VA Form 26-1817  and WebLGY should be completed by 
using the name of the surviving spou se, date of birth, social security 
number, and then upload the VA Form 26-1817  in WebLGY.

 4. Proof of Service Requirements 
 
Change Date March 28, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a. Discharged 
Veterans (Regular Military) The DD214 Form , Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty,  will 
generally contain all the information needed for VA to make an eligibility 
determination for person s who served on active duty of the a regular 
component of the Armed Forces.  The regular Armed Forces include active 
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.  
 
 VA will accept legible copies of the DD214 Form . 
 Veterans separated after Oct ober 1, 1979, should furnish Member 
Copy 2, 4, 8, or any copy of a DD214 Form  that includes the COS and 
the narrative reason for separation.  Veterans separated from military 
service after January 1, 1950, should have received  DD214 Form . Veterans separated from active duty before January 1, 
1950, received documentation other than DD214 Form .  To be 
acceptable, it should indicate: 
 
a) LOS, and 
b) COS 
 
 
b. Veterans 
Still on Active Duty Proof of service for Veterans on active  duty is a Statement of Service (SOS) 
signed by, or by the direction of, the ad jutant, personnel office, or commander 
of the unit or higher headquarters they ar e attached to. Ther e is no one unique 
form used by the military for an SOS.  While an SOS is typically on military 
letterhead, it may also be electronic and both are acceptable.  The SOS must 
clearly show the: 
 
 Veteran’s full name, 
 social Security Number (SSN) or  the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
 entry date on active duty, 
 duration of lost time, if any, and 
 name and point of contac t for the command or unit.

 4. Proof of Service Requirements, continued 
 
c. Discharged Reserve/ Guard Members  
There is no one form used by the Reserves  or National Guard that is similar to 
DD214 Form .  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit with the Ready 
Reserve designated by their respective services and approved by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff as so essential to in itial wartime missions that they have 
priority over all other reserves.  The National Guard is a unique element of the U.S. Military that serves both 
community and country.  Any state gover nor or the President of the United 
States can call on the Guard in a moments notice.  Discharged members of the Army or Air National Guard may submit NGB 
Form 22 , Report of Separation and Record of Service , and NGB Form 23B , 
Retirement Points Summary Statement , with the COS document.  Members of 
the Reserves should submit their points statement with COS.  Typically, all members of the Reserv es and/or Guard receive an annual 
retirement points summary which indicates the level and length of participation.  The applicant should submit the latest retirement point 
statement received, along with evidence of honorable service. 
 VA will accept le
gible copies. 
 
d. Current Reserve/ Guard Members Individuals who are still members of  the Reserves/National Guard must 
provide an SOS signed by, or by the di rection of, the adjutant, personnel 
office, or commander of the unit or highe r headquarters they  are attached to. 
There is no one form used uniformly by the military for an SOS.  While an 
SOS is typically on military letterhead, some may be electronic and both are 
acceptable.    The statement of service must clearly show the:  
 Veteran’s full name, 
 the SSN or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
 entry date of the applican t’s Reserve/Guard duty, and 
 the unit must state the creditable (act ually drilled) years served in the 
Reserves or the National Guard.

d. Current 
Reserve/ Guard Members, Continued   
If called to active duty, a copy of the or ders must accompany the SOS with the 
name and point of contac t for the command or unit. 
 The statement must clearly indicate that th e applicant is an “active” reservist or 
National Guard member and not just in  a control group (i nactive status). 
 If Veterans cannot locate proof  of service, they can re quest military documents 
either through the National Archives, http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ , or by 
completing SF- 180 , Request Pertaining to Military Records.  The completed 
form should be submitted to the appr opriate address shown. It should not be 
sent to VA.  In many cases, VA internal systems will have sufficient information to make 
the eligibility determination for those who served on active duty.  Lenders and 
Veterans should not delay requesting a COE pending receipt of requested 
military documents.

Change Date March 28, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a. General 
Rule for Eligibility A Veteran is eligible for VA home loan be nefits if he or she served on active 
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Ma rine Corps, or Coast Guard after 
September 15, 1940, and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable after either: 
 
 90 days or more, any part of wh ich occurred during wartime, or 
 181 continuous days or more (peacetime). 
 
b. 2-year 
Requirement A greater length of service is  required for Veterans who:

 the full period for which called or ordered to active duty, but not less 
than 90 days (any part during wa rtime) or 181 continuous days 
(peacetime). 
 
Cases involving other than honorable disc harges will usually require further 
development by the VA Compensation Depa rtment.  This is necessary to 
determine if the service was under other than dishonorable conditions. 
 
 
 
c. Wartime 
and Peacetime Refer to the Following Periods of Service  
Wartime Peacetime 
World War II  9/16/1940—7/25/1947 Post World War II period

d. Eligibility 
for Reserves and/or Guard  
Members of the Reserves and National Guard who are not otherwise eligible 
for loan guaranty benefits are eligib le upon completion of 6 years of service 
in an active or drilling status in the Re serves or Guard (unless released earlier 
specifically for a service-connected disa bility).  The applicant must have 
received an honorable character of disc harge.  A general or under honorable 
conditions discharge is not a qualifying or acceptable character of discharge.  Service in the Individual Ready Reserve or Control Group (inactive status) is 
not qualif
ying length of service for the home loan pro gram.   
 
 e. Basic Eligibility Table  
The table below provides a quick refere nce to some of the most commonly 
eligible Veterans.  This table is not exhaustive.  A Veteran’s eligibility for 
home loan benefits may only be determined by VA.  
 
f. Eligibility of Spouses of Veterans  
Some spouses of Veterans may have hom e loan eligibility.  They are the: 
 
 unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran, who died as a result of 
service or service- connected causes, 
 surviving spouse of a Veteran w ho dies on active duty or from 
service-connected causes, who rema rries on or after age 57 and on or 
after December 16, 2003, and 
 spouse of an active duty member who is listed as MIA or a POW for 
at least 90 days. Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited 
to one-time use only. 
 surviving spouses of Veterans w ho died from non-service connected 
causes may also be eligible if cer tain conditions are met.  Those 
conditions are found in Topic 3, subs ection b(1), of this chapter. 
 surviving spouse who is eligible for or in receipt of certain types of 
Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC). 
 
 g. Additional Eligibility

h. Other Qualifying Service  
Congress has periodically granted Ve teran status to groups other than 
members of the Army, Air Force, Na vy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, 
such as certain members of the Public  Health Service, and cadets at the 
service academies.  Lenders should cont act one of the RLCs for assistance 
when one of these unique cases is encountered.  
 i. Exceptions to LOS  
There are numerous exceptions to th e LOS requirements outlined in this 
section.  For example, 1 day of service is sufficient for an individual who is 
discharged or released from service (regular active duty or Reserve/National 
Guard) due to a service-connected disa bility which would be listed on the 
discharge paperwork.  Because of the complexity and number of exceptions, this chapter does not atte mpt to cover all of them.  Because there are 
exceptions, lenders should not assume a Ve teran is not eligible.  Instead, they 
should create an application and allow VA to make a formal determination of 
eligibility.  
 j. When a COE is Denied  
The table below provides a quick refe rence to some additional types of 
eligible Veterans.  This table is not exhaustive.  A Veteran’s eligibility for

restored under certain circumstances.  Once restored, it can be used again for 
another VA loan.  Restoration of previ ously used entitlement is possible if: 
 
 property which secured the VA-guarant eed loan has been sold, and the 
loan has been paid in full; or 
 eligible Veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding 
balance on a VA loan and substitute  his or her entit lement for the 
same amount originally used on the loan.  The assuming Veteran, 
substituting his/her entitlement, mu st also meet occupancy, income, 
and credit requirements.  This shoul d be completed before requesting 
the Loan Guaranty Certificate in WebLGY, on the new loan. 
 
 b. Special Restoration Cases  
In addition to the basic restor ation criteria outlined above, a  
Veteran may obtain restorat ion of the entitlement used on a prior VA loan 
under any of the following circumstances:  
 Regular “cash-out” refinance where the prior VA loan has been paid 
in full and the Veteran has made app lication for a refinance loan to be 
secured by the same property which secured the prior VA loan.  This 
includes refinancing situations, in which the prior loan will be paid off 
at closing from a VA refinancing loan on the same property, or 
 One –time restoration where the prior VA loan has been paid in full, 
but the Veteran has not disposed of  the property securing the loan.  
The Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on the 
prior loan in order to purchase a different property, one time only.  
Once such restoration is used, the Veteran’s COE will indicate the one-time restoration.  The COE will also advise that any future restoration (purchase or cash-out refi nance) will require disposal of all 
property or properties obtained with a VA loan.  
Example.  A Veteran used all his en titlement to purchase a home for 
$453,100 in a non-high cost county in Maryla nd.  Prior to job relocation to 
GA, he refinanced the loan to a non-VA loan.  The loan was paid in full; 
however, he still owned th e property.  He now want s to purchase a home in 
GA and applies for a one-time restoration.  This is possible.  If the Veteran 
wants to use the benefit in the future  for another purchas e or regular “cash-
out” refinancing, both properties would have to be disposed of before 
entitlement can be restored.

 7. Misuse of Veteran’s Entitlement 
 
 a. What Constitutes Misuse?  
 
A basic requirement of the law governi ng the VA home loan program is that 
the Veteran has a bona fide  intention of occupying his or her property as a 
home.  Home loan entitlement is not  being used properly if the Veteran 
arranges to sell or convey the property to a third party prior to closing the 
loan.  
 
b. What to Do?  
Contact the VA RLC with jurisdiction over the property for advice regarding 
any case in which there may be a qu estion regarding the legality of 
entitlement use.

understanding a VA loan guaranty.  Ex ceptions and detailed explanations 
have been omitted.  Instead, a referen ce to the section in this handbook that 
addresses each subj ect is provided.  
 
Subject Explanation Section 
Maximum Loan 
Amount VA has no specified dollar amount(s) for the “maximum 
loan.”  The maximum loan amount depends upon:  
• the reasonable value of the pr operty indicated on the Notice 
of Value (NOV), and 
• the lenders needs in term s of secondary market 
requirements. 3 of this 
chapter 
Downpayment No downpayment is required by VA unless the purchase price 
exceeds the reasonable value of the property, or the loan is a Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM).  The lender may require a downpayment if necessa ry to meet secondary market 
requirements. 3 of this 
chapter 
Amount of Guaranty Guaranty is the amount VA may pay a lender in the event of 
loss due to foreclosure.   4 of this

some of the points. 
• Points must be reasonable. 
• Points may not be financed in th e loan except with Interest Rate 
Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs). 6 and 7

Purpose of Guaranty To encourage lenders to make VA loans by protecting 
lenders/loan holders agai nst loss, up to the amount of guaranty, in 
the event of foreclosure. 11 of

Underwriting Flexible standards.  The veteran must have: 
 
• satisfactory credit, and 
• satisfactory repayment ability 
− stable income 
− residual income (net effective income minus monthly shelter 
expense) in accordance with regional tables, and 
− acceptable ratio of total monthly debt payments to gross 
   monthly income (A ratio in  excess of 41% requires closer 
   scrutiny and compensating factors.). chapter

IRRRLs 
(Streamline Refinancing Loans) Used to refinance an existing VA loan at a lower interest rate. 
 
• No appraisal or underw riting is required. 
• Closing costs may be financed in the loan. 
• Any reasonable discount points can be charged, but only two 
discount points can be financed in the loan. 
• No cash to the borrower.

Funding Fee The veteran must pay a funding fee to help defray costs of the VA 
Home Loan program. 
 
• Find the percentage appropriate to the veteran’s particular 
circumstances on the funding fee table. 
• Apply this percentage to the loan amount to arrive at the 
funding fee. 
• The funding fee may always be financed in the loan. 8 of

Closing costs Those payable by the ve teran are limited by regulation to a 
specific list of items plus a one pe rcent flat charge by the lender. 
 
• Any other party, including the seller, can pay any costs on 
behalf of the veteran. 
• Closing costs cannot be financed in the loan except on certain 
refinancing loans.  (See chapter 8 .) 2, 4,

• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. 
• Subsection a has been updated to rem ove information on cooperative units. 
  
a. List of 
Eligible Loan Purposes The law authorizes VA to guarantee loans made to eligible veterans only for 
the following purposes:  
• To purchase or construct a residence,  including a condominium unit to be 
owned and occupied by the veteran as a home: 
− the loan may include simultaneous purchase of the land on which the 
residence is situated or will be situated, 
− loans may also be guaranteed for th e construction of a residence on land 
already owned by the veteran  (a por tion of the loan may be used to 
refinance a purchase money mortgage or  sales contract for the purchase of 
the land, subject to reasonab le value requirements), and 
− the residential property may not consist of more than four family units 
and one business unit except in the ca se of certain joint loans.  (See 
section 1 of chapter 7  for this exception.) 
• To refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan for the purpose of a 
lower interest rate. 
• To refinance an existing mortgage loan  or other indebtedness secured by a 
lien of record on a residence owned a nd occupied by the veteran as a home. 
• To repair, alter, or improve a reside nce owned by the veteran and occupied 
as a home. 
• To simultaneously purchase and improve a home. 
• To improve a residence owned and occ upied by the veteran as the veteran’s 
home through the installation of a sola r heating system, a solar heating and 
cooling system, or a combined solar heating and cooling system, or through 
the application of a residential energy  conservation measure.  These energy 
efficiency improvement loans can be ma de in conjunction with any type of 
VA purchase or refinancing loan. 
• To purchase a one-family resident ial unit in a condominium housing 
development approved by VA. 
• To purchase a farm residence to be owned and occupied by the veteran as a 
home.  If the loan includes the purchase of farmland, the farmland is 
appraised at its residential va lue only.  (See section 12 of chapter 11 ).

3-6 2.  Eligible Loan Purposes, Continued 
 
b. Ineligible 
Loan Purposes VA cannot guarantee loans made for inelig ible loan purposes.  Examples of 
ineligible loan purposes include:  
• Purchase of unimproved land with the in tent to improve it at some future 
date (that is, the land purchase is not in conjunction w ith a construction 
loan). 
• Purchase or construction of a dwelling for investment purposes. 
• Purchase or construction of a combin ed residential and business property, 
unless, 
− the property is primarily for residential purposes, 
− there is not more than one business unit, and 
− the nonresidential area does not exceed 25 percent of the total floor area. 
• Purchase of more than one separa te residential unit or lot unless  the veteran 
will occupy one unit and there is evidence that: 
− the residential units are unavailable separately, 
− the residential units have a common owner, 
− the residential units have been tr eated as one unit in the past, and 
− the residential units are assessed as one unit, or 
− partition is not practical, as when one  unit serves the other(s) in some 
respect; for example, common approaches or driveways. 
 
c. Cash to 
Veteran Generally Not an Eligible Loan Purpose Cash to the veteran from loan proceeds is permissible only fo r certain types of 
refinancing loans and under very limited circumstances, as follows: 
 
• For IRRRLs, see section 1 of chapter 6 . 
• For cash-out refinancing lo ans, see section 3 of chapter 6 . 
 
For other types of refina ncing loans and all purcha se/acquisition loans, the 
veteran generally cannot receive cash from loan proceeds.  The only exception is the refund of items for whic h the veteran paid cash, which were 
subsequently included in the loan amount.  Example :  Earnest money can be refunded to the veteran on a no-
downpayment loan.

• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. 
 
a. Does VA 
have Maximum 
Loan Amounts? Unlike other home loan programs, there are no maximum dollar amounts 
prescribed for VA-guaranteed loans.    Limitations on VA loan size are primarily attributable to two factors:  1. Lenders who sell their VA loans in the secondary market must limit the 
size of those loans to the maximums prescribed by Government National 
Mortgage Association (GNMA) or wh atever conduit they use to sell the 
loans. 
 2. VA limits the amount of the loan to the reasonable value of the property 
shown on the NOV plus the cost of energy efficiency improvements up to $6,000 plus  the VA  funding fee, with the following exceptions.   
 
Exception Maximum Loan 
IRRRLs • Existing VA loan balance, plus 
• The cost of any energy efficiency 
improvements up to $6,000, plus  
• Allowable fees and charges, plus  
• Up to two discount points, plus  
• VA funding fee. 
 
(Lenders must use VA Form 26 -8923 , IRRRL 
Worksheet, for the actual calculation.)

a. Does VA have Maximum Loan Amounts? (continued)  
 
Exception Maximum Loan 
Regular refinancing 
loan (cash-out) • 100 percent of the VA reasonable value,  plus 
• the cost of any energy efficiency improvements 
up to $6,000, plus 
• VA funding fee. 
Loans to refinance are: 
 
• a construction loan, 
• an installment land 
sales contract, or 
• a loan assumed by 
   the veteran at an    interest rate higher     than that for the    proposed refinancing    loan. The lesser of: 
 
• the VA reasonable value, or 
• the sum of the outstanding balance of the loan 
plus allowable closing co sts and discounts, plus 
• For construction loans, “balance of the loan” 
includes the balances of construction financing and lot liens, if any. 
• the cost of any energy efficiency improvements 
up to $6,000, plus 
• VA funding fee. 
Graduated Payment 
Mortgage (GPM) loan on existing property • The VA reasonable value, minus  
• the highest amount of negative amortization, 
plus 
• the cost of any energy efficiency improvements 
up to $6,000, plus  
• VA funding fee. 
 Reference :  See section 7 of chapter 7 . 
GPM loan on new home 97.5 percent lesser of: 
 
• the VA reasonable value or 
• the purchase price, plus 
• the cost of any energy efficiency improvements 
up to $6,000, plus

b. 
Downpayment Because VA loans can be for the full reasonable value of the property, no 
downpayment is required by VA except in the following circumstances: 
 
• If the purchase price exceeds the reasonable value of the property, a 
downpayment in the amount of the difference must be made in cash from the borrower’s own resources, and 
• VA requires a downpayment on all GPMs. 
 If a veteran has less than full entitleme nt available, a lender may require a 
downpayment in order to make the veteran a loan that meets GNMA or other secondary market requirements.  The  “rule of thumb” for GNMA is that the 
VA guaranty, or a combination of VA guaranty plus downpayment and/or 
equity, must cover at least 25 percent of the loan.

Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to no te that Public Law 112-154 extended the 
temporary guaranty increase from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 
2014.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.   
  
a. Maximum 
Guaranty Table Public Law 112-154, the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp 
Lejeune Families Act of 2012 , signed August 6, 2012, extended the 
temporary increase in the maximu m guaranty.  The increase expired 
December 31, 2011, but Public Law 112-154, extended it through December 
31, 2014.  The maximum guaranty varies depending on the location of the 
property.  While VA does not have a maximum loan amount, there are 
effective “loan limits” for high-cost counties.  The limits are derived by 
considering both the median home pri ce for a county and the Freddie Mac 
conforming loan limit.  To aid lenders in determining the maximum guaranty in high-cost counties, VA has created a Loan Limit  chart, with instructions.  
This will be updated yearly. 
 
• In general, maximum guaranty, assumi ng the veteran has full entitlement, is 
as shown in the table below. 
    
Loan Amount Maximum Potential 
Guaranty Special Provisions 
Up to $45,000 50 percent of the loan 
amount. Minimum guaranty 
of 25 percent on IRRRLs. 
$45,001 to $56,250 $22,500 Minimum guaranty 
of 25 percent on IRRRLs. 
$56,251 to $144,000 40 percent of the loan 
amount, with a maximum of $36,000. Minimum guaranty 
of 25 percent on IRRRLs. 
$144,001 to $417,000 25 percent of the loan 
amount Minimum guaranty 
of 25 percent on IRRRLs.  
Greater than $417,000 The lesser of:

3-12 5.  Occupancy 
 
Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• Subsection c has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154, the 
Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 
2012 , signed August 6, 2012, expands occupancy to include dependent 
children.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.  
  
a. The Law on 
Occupancy The law requires a veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan to certify that he 
or she intends to personally  occupy the property as his or her home.  As of the 
date of certification, th e veteran must either 
 
• personally live in the property as his or her home, or 
• intend, upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling, to 
personally move into the property and use it as his or he r home within a 
reasonable time. 
 The above requirement applies to all types of VA-guaranteed loans except IRRRLs.  For IRRRLs, the veteran need onl y certify that he or she previously 
occupied the property as his or her home.  
Example :  A veteran living in a home purchas ed with a VA loan is transferred 
to a duty station overseas.  The vete ran rents out the home.  He/she may 
refinance the VA loan with an IRRRL based on previous occupancy of the 
home. 
 
b. What is a 
“Reasonable 
Time?” Occupancy within a “reasonable time" means within 60 days after the loan 
closing.  More than 60 days may be considered reasonable if both of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
• the veteran certifies that he or she will personally occupy the property as his 
or her home at a specific da te after loan closing, and 
• there is a particular future event that  will make it possible for the veteran to 
personally occupy the property as his or her home on a specific future date. 
 Occupancy at a date beyond 12 months af ter loan closing generally cannot be 
considered reasonable by VA.

3-13 5.  Occupancy, Continued 
  
c. Occupancy 
by Veteran’s 
Spouse or 
Dependent 
Child Occupancy (or intent to occupy) by the spouse or dependent child satisfies the 
occupancy requirement for a vetera n who is on active duty and cannot 
personally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time.  In the case of a 
dependent child, the veteran’s attorney -in-fact or legal guardian of the 
dependent child must make the certification and sign VA Form 26-1820 , 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement. 
 Occupancy by the spouse may also satis fy the requirement if the veteran 
cannot personally occupy the dwelling w ithin a reasonable time due to distant 
employment other than military service. In these specific cases, consult your 
Regional Loan Center  (RLC) to determine if this type of occupancy meets 
VA requirements. 
 
Note :  The cost of maintaining sepa rate living arrangements should be 
considered in underwriting the loan.  
For an IRRRL, a certification that the s pouse or dependent child (or children) 
previously occupied the dwelling as  a home will satisfy the requirement. 
 
 
d. Occupancy 
Requirements  
for Deployed  Active Duty Servicemembers  Single or married servicemembers, wh ile deployed from their permanent 
duty station, are considered to be in  a temporary duty status and able to 
meet the occupancy requirement.  This is true without regard to whether or 
not a spouse will be available to occu py the property prior to the veteran’s 
return from deployment.  
  
e. Occupancy 
After 
Retirement If the veteran states that he or she will retire within 12 months and wants a 
loan to purchase a home in  the retirement location: 
 
• Verify the veteran’s eligibility for retirement on the specified date. 
- Include a copy of the veteran’s applic ation for retirement submitted to his 
or her employer. 
• Carefully consider the applicant’s income after retirement. 
- If retirement income alone is insufficient, obtain firm commitments from an employer that meet the usual stability of income requirements. 
 Note :  Only retirement on a specific da te within 12 months qualifies.  
Retirement “within the next few years”  or “in the near future” is not 
sufficient.

f. Delayed 
Occupancy Due 
to Property 
Repairs or Improvements Home improvements or refinancing loans for extensive changes to the 
property which will prevent the vete ran from occupying the property while 
the work is being completed, constitu te exceptions to the “reasonable time” 
requirement.    The veteran must certify that he or she intends to occupy or reoccupy the 
property as a home upon completion of  the substantial improvements or 
repairs. 
   
g. Intermittent 
Occupancy The veteran need not maintain a physical  presence at the property on a daily 
basis.  However, occupancy “as the ve teran’s home” implies that the home is 
located within reasonable proximity of the veteran’s place of employment.  If 
the veteran’s employment requires the veteran’s absence from home a 
substantial amount of time, the following two conditions must be met:  
• the veteran must have a history of continuous residence in the community, 
and 
• there must be no indication that the veteran has established, intends to 
establish, or may be required to estab lish, a principal residence elsewhere. 
 
Use of the property as a seasonal va cation home does not satisfy the 
occupancy requirement . 
 
h. Unusual 
Circumstances Discuss unusual circumstances of occupancy with the appropriate VA office  
or submit a description of the circumstances to the VA office  for prior 
approval.

3-15 5.  Occupancy, Continued 
  
i. The 
Certification The veteran certifies that the occupa ncy requirement is met by checking the 
appropriate occupancy block and signing: 
 
• VA Form 26-1802a , HUD/VA Addendum to the Uniform Residential Loan 
Application, at the time of  loan application (prior  approval loans only), and 
• VA Form 26-1820 , Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement, at the 
time of loan closing (all loans).   
 This satisfies the lender’s obligati on to obtain the veteran’s occupancy 
certification.  The lender may accept the occupancy certi fication at face value unless there 
is specific information indicating the veteran will not occupy the property as a 
home or does not intend to occupy within a reasonable time after loan closing. 
 Where doubt exists, the test is whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that the veteran can and will occupy the prope rty as certified.  
Contact the appropriate VA office  if the lender cannot resolve issues 
involving the veteran’s inte nt by applying this test.

3-16 6.  Interest Rates 
 
Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement VA no longer prescribes inte rest rates for VA-guaranteed loans.  The interest 
rate is negotiated between the vetera n-borrower and the lender to allow the 
veteran to obtain the best available rate. 
 
b. Changes to 
the Agreed Upon Interest 
Rate The lender and borrower are expected  to honor any lock-in or other 
agreements they have entered into which impact the interest rate on the loan.  
VA does not object to changes in the agreed upon rate, as long as no 
lender/borrower agreements are violate d.  The following procedure applies in 
such cases.   Any increase in the interest rate of more than one percent requires:  
• re-underwriting to ascertain the veteran’ s continued ability to qualify for the 
loan, 
• documentation of the change, and  
• a new or corrected Uniform Resident ial Loan Application, (URLA) with 
any corrections initialed and dated by the borrower.

Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement Veterans may pay reasonable discount points on VA-guaranteed loans.  The 
amount of discount points is whatever  the borrower and lender agree upon.  
Discount points can be based on the prin cipal amount of the loan after adding 
the VA funding fee, if the funding fee will be paid from loan proceeds. 
 
b. When Can 
Points be Included in the 
Loan? Discount points may be rolled into the loan only in the case of refinancing  
loans, subject to the following limitations:  
Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans  
A maximum of two discount points can be rolled into the loan. 
 If the borrower pays more than two poi nts, the remainder must be paid in 
cash . 
 
Refinancing of Construction Loans, etc. 
Loans to refinance are: 
 
• a construction loan, 
• an installment land sales contract, or 
• a loan assumed by the veteran at an in terest rate higher than that for the 
proposed refinancing loan   
 Any reasonable amount of discount points ma y be rolled into the loan as long 
as the sum of the outstanding balance of the loan plus allowable closing costs 
and discount points does not exceed  the VA reasonable value.  
 
Reference :  See the maximum loan limitations  in section 3 of  this chapter. 
 
Cash-out Refinancing Loans 
While discount points cannot specifically  be included in the loan amount, the 
borrower can receive cash from loan proceeds, subject to maximum loan 
limits (See section 3 of this chapter) .  The cash received by the borrower can 
be used for any purpose acceptable to the lender, including payment of reasonable discount points.

c. Changes to 
the Agreed 
Upon Discount 
Points The lender and borrower are expected to honor any agreements they have 
entered into which impact the discount  points paid on the loan.  VA does not 
object to changes in the agreed upon poi nts, as long as no lender/borrower 
agreements are violated.  The following procedures apply in such cases.   Any increase in discount points requires:  
• verification that the borrower has suffi cient assets to cover the increase, 
• documentation of the change, and 
• a new or corrected URLA with any co rrections initialed and dated by the 
borrower.

grammatical edits.   
  
a. Maximum 
Maturity • Amortized loans:  30 years and 32 days,  
• Nonamortized loans: 5 years. 
 In addition, every loan must be repaya ble within the estim ated economic life 
of the property securing the loan.  The period for repayment of a loan is measured from the date of the note or 
other evidence of  indebtedness. 
 
b. Maturity 
Extending 
Beyond the 
Maximum VA regulations provide that any amounts, which fall due beyond the 
maximum maturity automatically, fall due  on the maximum maturity date.   
 Thus, if a lender inadvertently makes a loan that exceeds the maximum maturity, it may still be subject to guaranty.    However, the regulations also limit the amount that can be collected as a final 
installment, such as, they prohibit ex cessive ballooning.  The holder of a loan 
that violates this provis ion may desire to correct the situation through means 
which are legally proper in the jurisdiction.

Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement All VA loans must be amortized if the maturity date is beyond 5 years from 
the date of the loan.  Loans with term s less than 5 years are considered term 
loans and need not be amortized.  Generally, for amortized VA loans:  
• payments must be approximately equal, 
• principal must be reduced at least once annually, and 
• the final installment must not exceed two times the average of the preceding 
installments. 
 Exceptions to these requirements are made in the case of:  
• GPMs – See section 7 of chapter 7 , 
• Growing Equity Mortgages (G EMs) – See section 8 of chapter 7 , 
• alternative amortization plan s prior approved by VA, and 
• construction loans. 
 
b. Alternative 
Amortization 
Plans  Certain amortization plans which do not meet the requirements described in 
subsection a above may be used if ap proved in advance by VA.  A lender may 
submit an amortization plan to VA for prior approval if the plan: 
 
• is generally recognized; that is, is us ed extensively by established lending 
institutions, but 
• does not meet the requirements of appr oximately equal periodic payments 
and a reduction in principal not less often than annually. 
 
Exception :  GPMs and GEMs.

The amount applied to interest decrease s, with a corresponding increase in 
the amount applied to principal. 
• The Springfield plan provides for gr adually decreasing payments over the 
life of the loan.  The amount applied to interest decreases, while the amount 
applied to principal remains constant.

Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Protection 
Against Loss VA guarantees a portion of the loan, identified on the VA Loan Guaranty 
Certificate (LGC) by percentage and dollar amounts.  If a loss ultimately occurs on the loan, VA will reimburse the loan holder for all or part of such loss:  
• limited by the stated percentage and dollar amount of the guaranty, 
• limited by any VA maximums for reas onable and customary foreclosure 
expenses, and 
• subject to the lender’s compliance wi th applicable law and regulations. 
 
b. Lender 
Responsibility It is the lender’s responsib ility to comply with all laws and regulations related 
to the VA Home Loan program, and ther eby prevent VA’s denial or reduction 
of a payment on a future claim.  A lende r can accomplish this by ensuring that 
its employees who perform work related to VA lending:  
• understand and comply with VA policies,  procedures and regulations, and 
applicable law, and 
• direct questions to VA when issues ar ise that are not addressed in this 
handbook or other materials provided by VA. 
 
c. When is a 
Loan that was 
Closed 
Automatically Guaranteed? A loan is automatically guaranteed by  VA upon closing (prior to issuance of 
the LGC) provided the loan was made by:  
• a supervised or a nonsupervised lend er with automatic authority, and 
• the lender complied with app licable law and regulations.

3-24 11.  What Does a VA Guaranty Mean to the Lender?, Continued 
  
d. When is a 
Prior Approval 
Loan 
Guaranteed?  A prior approval loan is also gua ranteed by VA upon closing (prior to 
issuance of the LGC) provided:  
• the closed loan matches the proposed  loan upon which the Certificate of 
Commitment was based, and 
• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations. 
  
e. What is 
Evidence of 
Guaranty? Evidence of guaranty is VA Form 26-1899, Loan Guaranty Certificate, which 
is generated electronically via VA’s webLGY application.  The LGC 
represents tangible proof to the lende r that VA’s guaranty is given in good 
faith.  It is contingent upon:  
• the veteran, property and purpose of the loan being eligible, 
• no fraud or material misrepresentat ion on the part of the lender, and 
• the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 For example, VA may deny or reduce paym ent on a future claim based on the 
lender or holder’s noncompliance whether or not VA has issued evidence of 
guaranty on the loan.  The LGC also has an audit indicator th at, if noted Yes, lets the lender know 
the case has been identified for full review .  In these instances, the lender then 
needs to submit a complete loan origination package to the appropriate VA office for review.  Packages should be submitted within 15 days of the LGC being generated. 
 
f. Total Loss of 
Guaranty Willful fraud or material misrepresentation by the lender or holder, or by an 
agent of either, will relieve VA of lia bility for payment of any claim on the 
loan.  VA also has no liability in the case of: 
 
• forgery on the note, mortgage, loan app lication, or other loan documents, or 
• a Certificate of Eligibility or disc harge papers that are counterfeited, 
falsified, or not issued by the Government. 
 A holder of a VA loan who acquired the loan without  notice or knowledge of 
fraud or material misrepresentation in procuring the guaranty will not be 
denied payment of any claim on the loan  by reason of such fraud or material 
misrepresentation.

g. Partial Loss 
of Guaranty A holder of a VA loan who fails to comply with applicable laws and 
regulations may receive only partial pa yment of a claim if  VA’s liability 
increases due to the holder’s noncomp liance.  Material misrepresentation 
which is not willful has the same consequence.   No claim will be paid on such loan until the amount of any increase in VA’s liability is known.  The bur den of proof is on the holde r to establish that VA’s 
increased liability is not due to  the holder’s noncompliance or 
misrepresentation.  Examples  of noncompliance with applicable  law and regulations which may 
lead to an increase in VA’s liability include: 
 
• failure to obtain and retain the requi red lien on property to secure the loan, 
• failure to include the powe r to substitute trustees, 
• failure to procure and main tain insurance coverage, 
• failure to advise VA as to default, 
• failure to provide notice of inte ntion to begin foreclosure action, 
• failure to provide notice to VA in a ny suit or action, or notice of sale, 
• improper release, conveyance, substi tution or exchange of security, 
• lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction, 
• failure to assure that escrowed/earma rked funds are expended in accordance 
with the agreement, and 
• failure to take into consideration li mitations upon the quantum or quality of 
the estate or property.

• This section has been cha nged to include hyperlinks. 
  
a. Corrections 
to LGCs LGCs are generated using data entere d from several sources, including the 
VA Funding Fee Payment System  (VA FFPS).  If a lender discovers an error 
in reported data, such as  date of loan closing, before  they have generated the 
LGC, they must access the VA FFPS system to make the correction.  This will then result in the correct closi ng date being shown when the LGC is 
obtained.    If the error is discovered after  the LGC has been generated, lenders will need 
to contact the appropriate VA RLC  for assistance.  An LGC with minor 
typographical errors that do not compro mise accurate identification of the 
loan is valid. 
 
b. Replacement 
of Missing LGC 
with Duplicate A lender may obtain duplicate LGCs at  any time simply by accessing the 
system and reprinting the LGC.   
  
c. Transfer of 
Loans It is not necessary to notify VA of the assignment of a guaranteed loan. 
 
d. Loan 
Assumptions The assumption of VA-guaranteed loans for which commitments were made 
on or after March 1, 1988, requires the a pproval of VA (or certain lenders on 
VA’s behalf).

e. Paid-in-Full 
Loans Holders of VA-guaranteed loans are requi red to electronically  report the date 
the loan was paid-in-full in the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) system. Lenders are required  to report paid-in-full loans to VA 
upon full satisfaction of the loan by payment or otherwise.    Lenders/servicers are not required to mail LGCs to VA when a loan is 
terminated. Since this information will now be reported through VALERI, 
there is no need to have the actual LGC returned to VA upon termination of 
the loan. 
 
f. Maintenance 
of Loan 
Records Lenders must maintain copies of all loan origination records on  
VA-guaranteed home loans for at least 2 years from the date of loan closing.  Even if the loan is sold, the original lender must maintain these records (or legible copies) for th e required period.  
 Loan origination records include:  
• the loan application (including any preliminary application), 
• verifications of empl oyment and deposit, 
• all credit reports (including preliminary credit reports), 
• copies of each sales contract and addendum, 
• letters of explanation for adverse cred it items, discrepancies and the like, 
• direct references from creditors, 
• correspondence with employers, 
• appraisal and compliance inspection reports, 
• reports on termite and other in spections of the property, 
• builder change orders, and 
• all closing papers and documents. 
 Lenders must make these records accessible to VA personnel conducting 
audit reviews.

 1. General Underwriting Information    
 
Change Date   
February 22, 2019   
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. 
Underwriting 
Information  VA Underwriting Standards require lenders to always utilize the following 
guidance when underwriting VA -guaranteed loans:  
  
Lenders are encouraged to make VA loans to all qualified Veterans who apply.  
VA’s underwriting standards are intended to provide guidelines for 
underwriters.  Decisions must be based on sound application of the standards, 
and underwriters are expected to use good judgment and flexibility in applyi ng 
underwriting guidelines.  Not all possible circumstances are addressed 
therefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexibility in 
administering this important Veterans’ benefit.  
 
b. Basic 
Requirements  By law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that 
the Veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated 
income that bears a proper relation to the anticipated terms of repayment.  
VA’s underwriting stan dards are incorporated into VA regulations at  
38 C .F.R. 36.4340  and explained in this chapter.  This chapter addresses th e 
procedures for verifications and analysis involved in underwriting a  
VA-guaranteed loan.  In the event the lender fails to perform their 
responsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of 
authority to underwrite and close VA loans .

Responsibilities  Lenders are responsible for:  
 
• developing all credit information,  
• properly obtaining all required verifications and the credit report,  
• ensuring the accuracy of all information on which the loan decision is 
based,  
• complying with the law and regulations governing VA’s underwriting 
standards, and with VA’s underwriting policies, procedures, and 
guidelines, and  
• certifyi ng as to compliance with all of the above.

Procedures  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature  as 
defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act , 
commonly referred to as the E -sign Act.  
 
The procedures below address only the credit underwriting of the loan.   
Chapter 5 of this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed 
when making a VA loan.   
 
Step  Action  
1  
Initiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System 
(CAIVR S) inquiries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this  
chapter . 
2  
Obtain all necessary verifications.   
 
The borrower’s authorization can be obtained separately for the 
lender’s required verifications, or on one blanket authorization form.  
  
The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY 
provides verification of the amount of the Veteran’s availab le 
entitlement, verification of exempt/non -exempt from the VA Funding 
Fee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability 
compensation.  Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal.  
 
The tri -merged credit report and verifications can be order ed by the 
lender or its agent or a party designated by the lender to perform that 
function.  However, these documents must always be delivered by the 
credit reporting agency or verifying party directly to the lender or its 
agent, and never to another party .  VA only permits the Veteran to 
pay for the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs 
that the lender may incur through other parties for obtaining the 
credit report.

Special Types 
of Loans  The underwriting standards and procedures explained in this chapter generally 
apply to purchase and regular “cash -out” refinance loans. However, some 
special underwriting considerations also apply and can be found in Chapter 7 
of this handbook . 
 
f. Refinancing 
Loans  The underwriting standards det ailed in this chapter apply to purchases and 
regular “cash -out” refinances.  IRRRLs  generally do not require any 
underwriting unless the loan is delinquent.  IRRRLs made to refinance VA 
loans 30 days or mo re past due must be submitted to VA for prior approval 
underwriting.  The underwriter must have concluded that:  
 
• the circumstances that caused the delinquency have been corrected, and  
• the Veteran can successfully maintain the new loan.

4-72. Income – Required Documentation and Analysis
Change Date  September 26, 2019 
•Subsection k has been updated for clarification.
a. 
Underwriter’s 
Objectives  It is the underwriter’s  objective to identify and verify income available to 
meet:  
•the mortgage payment,
•other shelter expenses,
•debts and obligations, and
•family living expenses.
b. Effective
IncomeIncome is considered effective when it is determined to be verifiable, stabl e 
and reliable, and anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future. Income 
analysis is not an exact science.  It requires the lender to underwrite each loan 
on a case -by-case basis, using good judgement and flexibility when warranted.
To determine whether income is stable and reliable, the probability of 
continued employment must be determined through examination of the:  
•borrower’s past employment record,
•borrower’s training, education, and qualifications for his or her current
position, and/or
•type of employment.
Only verified income can be considered in the repayment calculation.

 2. Income – Required Documentation and  Analysis , continued  
 
c. Spousal 
Income  Verify and treat the income of a spouse who will be contractually obligated on 
the loan the same as you would the income of a Veteran borrower that will be 
obligated on the loan.  However, to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act (ECOA), do not ask questions about the income of the 
borrower’s spouse unless the:  
 
• spouse will be contractually liable,  
• borrower is relying on the spouse’s income to qualify,  
• borrower is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance 
payments from the  spouse or former spouse, or  
• borrower resides and/or the property is in a community property state.   
 
In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be 
requested and considered in the same manner as for the borrower, even if the 
spouse w ill not be contractually obligated on the loan.  See Topic 5, subsection 
a, of this c hapter for additional guidelines for community property states when 
considering a spouse’s debts and credit history.  
 
The non -purchasing spouse’s (NPS) credit history does  not need to b e 
considered; however, the NPS’  liabilities must be considered to determine the 
exten t of the household liabilities.  
 
d. ECOA 
Considerations  Always inform the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) that they do not have 
to divulge information on the receipt of child support, alimony, or sep arate 
maintenance.  However, for this income to be considered in the loan analysis, 
it must be divulged and verified.  
 
Income cannot be discounted because of sex, marital status, age, race, or oth er 
prohibite d bases under ECOA.

e. Income from 
Non-Military 
Employment  Verify a minimum of 2 years  of employment.  Generally, in the borrower’s 
current position, 2 years of employment is a positive indicator of continued 
employment.  
 
If the borrower has been employed by the present employer less than 2 years:  
 
• verify prior employment , plus present employm ent covering a total  of 
2 years, or  
• provide an explanation of why 2 years of employment could not be 
verified,  
• compare any different types of employment verifications obtained 
(such as Verification of Employment (VOE), paystub(s), W2s, and tax 
returns) for consistency, and  
• clarify any substantial differences in the data that would have a bearing 
on the qualificati on of the borrower(s).  
 
Use of Employment Verification Services  
 
Lenders may use any employment verification service that provides the same 
information as the “full” verification generated through the “Work Number” 
for all applicants. Generally, this will  include the following information:  
 
• the current date,  
• employer name and address,  
• Veteran’s full legal name, social security number (compl ete or 
truncated) and job title,  
• employment status (Active or Inactive),  
• length of employment and start date,  
• salary r ate and pay frequency,  
• average hours per pay period,  
• summary of year to date information including base pay, ov ertime, 
commissions and bonuses,  and 
• reference number for the verification.

VA required an original VA Form 26 -8497. The requirements for obtaining a 
paystub have not changed. Hence, the paystub may be an original or a copy 
certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original.  
 
The lender may not charge a fee to obtain the employment verification 
information.  
 
Verificat ion with VA Standard Documentation  
 
Acceptable verification consists of  VA Form 26 -8497 , Request for Verification 
of Employment (VOE) or any format which furnishes the same information as  
VA Form 26 -8497, plus:  
 
• paystub(s) covering the most r ecent 30-day period with year -to-date 
information, if the employer normally provides a pay stub(s) to the 
borrower.  
• if the employer does not indicate the probability of continued 
employment on the VOE,  the lender is not required to request anything 
additional on that subject.  
 
The VOE and pay stub(s) must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for 
new construction) from the closing date.  
 
• For loans closed automatically, the date of the VOE and pay stub(s ) 
must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for 
new construction) from the closing date.  
• For prior approval loa ns, the date of the VOE and pay stub(s) must be 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 
days for  new construction) from the closing date.

6.  Additional documentation for a borrower(s) employed in building trades 
or other seasonal or climate -dependent work must provide, in addition to the 
standard documentation (VOE and pay stub(s)), the following:  
 
(a)  Documentation of the borrower’s total earnings year -to-date,  
 
(b)  Signed and dated individual income tax returns for the previous 2 years, 
and 
 
(c)  If borrower works out of a union, evidence of the union’s history with 
the borrower.  
 
Alternative Verification Documentation  
 
Alternative documentation may be submitted in place of a VOE if the lender 
concludes that the borrower’s income is stable, reliable, and anticipated to 
continue  for the foreseeable future; that is, if the borrower’s income qualifies 
as effective income.  T wo years  of employment with the same employer is not 
required to reach this conclusion.  
 
Alternative documentation consists of:  
 
• paystub(s) covering at least the most recent 30-day period with year -to 
date information,  
• W-2 Forms for the most recent 2 year s, and/or  
• telephone verification of the borrower’s current employment.

income:  
 
• the income must be consistent,  
• there must be a reasonable likelihood that it will continue in the 
foreseeable future based on its compatibility with the hours of duty and 
other work conditions of the borrower’s primary job and,  
• how long the borrower has been empl oyed under such an arrangement.

i. Income from 
Commissions  Verify comm ission income by obtaining the VOE or other written verification 
which provides the following:  
 
• the actual amount of commissions paid year-to-date,  
• the basis for payments (salary plus commission, straight commission, or 
draws against commission, or other), and  
• when commissions are paid bi -weekly, monthly, quarterly, 
semiannually, annually, or other.  
• individual income tax returns, signe d and dated, plus all applicable 
schedules for the previous 2 years (or additional periods if needed to 
demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record).  
 
Analyze Income  Derived from C ommissions   
 
Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the  borrower 
has obtained such income for at least 2 years.  Employment for l ess than 2 years 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
related employment and/or specialized training.  Employment of l ess than 1 
year can rarely qua lify; however, in -depth development is required for a 
conclusion of stable income on less than 1 year cases.  
 
For a borrower who will qualify using commission income of less than 25  
percent  of the to tal annual employment income, IRS Form 2106  expenses are 
not required to be deducted from income even if they are reported on IRS Form 
2106 . Additionally, the expenses are not required to be added as a monthly 
liability for the borrower.  
 
For a borrower earni ng commission income that is 25 percent  or more of 
annual employment income, IRS Form 2106  expenses must be deducted from 
gross commission income regardless of the length of time the borrower has 
filed the expenses with the IRS.

• Year-To-Date Profit and Loss statement  (if the most recent year’s tax 
return has not yet been prepared, provi de a profit and loss statement for 
that year ), 
• current Balance Sheet,  and  
• individual income tax returns, signed and dated, plus all applicable 
schedules for the previous 2 years (or additional periods if needed to 
demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record).   
• If the business is a corporation or partnership, include c opies of th e 
signed federal business income tax returns for the previous 2 years 
with all applicable schedules, and a list of all stockholders or partners 
showing the interest each holds in the business.  
 
The financial statements must be sufficient for an underwriter  to determine the 
necessary information for loan approval.  
 
Financial Statements, including a year -to-date Profit and Loss Statement and 
Balance Sheet must be completed after one -half of the tax -year has passed to 
verify current income and stability of th e income.  
 
The lender may require an accountant or C ertified Public Accountant -prepared 
financial statements if needed to make such a determination due to the nature 
of the business or the content of the financial statements .

Guideline , 
continued  Analyze Income Derived from Self -Employment  
 
Generally, income from self -employment  is considered stable when the 
borrower has obtained such income for at least 2 years.  Less-than-2-years 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
related employment and/or specialized training.  Less-than-1-year can rarely 
qualify; however, in -depth development is required for a conclusion of stable 
income on less -than-1-year cases.  
 
Determine whether the business can be expected to generate sufficient income 
for the borrower’s future needs.  
 
If the business shows a steady or significant decline in earnings over the 
period analyzed, the reasons for such decline must be analyzed to determine 
whether the trend is likely to continue or be reversed.  
 
If it is difficult to determine the probability of co ntinued operation, obtain 
documentation on the viability and potential future earnings, and an 
explanation of the function and financial operations of the b usiness from a 
qualified party.  
 
Deductions and Expenses Claimed on Tax Returns  
 
Depreciation claime d as a deduction on the tax returns and financial 
statements of the business may be included in effective income.  
 
Business or roll over losses must be considered from all tax returns.  
 
What is reported to the IRS on a joint return must be used when applyi ng for a 
federally guaranteed loan.  
 
On a joint tax return, the loss must be deducted from the borrower’s income in 
both community and non -community property states.  
 
On a joint tax return, when a borrower and co -borrower have been faced with 
business loss es, the Veteran/borrower and his/her spouse may want to consider 
both being on the loan in order to potentially qualify.  The credit of both 
borrowers will be considered.

k. Active 
Military 
Borrower’s 
Income  For active -duty military  borrowers, a Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) is 
required instead of a VOE.  The LES must be an original, electronic, or a copy 
certified by the lende r to be a true copy of the original.     
 
The LES must furnish the same information as a VOE and must be no more 
than 120 days old (180 days for new construction), from the date of closing.  
 
For loans closed automatically, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of 
the date the note is signed (180 days for new construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the 
date the application is received by VA ( 180 days for new construction).  
 
In addition, identify servic emembers who are within 12 months of release 
from active duty or  the end of their contract term. For an enlisted 
service member,  find the date of expiration (ETS) of the borrower’s current 
contra ct for active service on the LES.  For National Guard or Reserve 
members, find the ETS of the borrower’s current contract on the LES.  Also, if 
a National Guard or Reserve member is currently serving on active duty, also 
identify the expira tion date of the  current active -duty tou r.  If the date is within 
12 months of the projected date that the loan will close, the loan package must 
also include one of the following items, or combinations of items, to be 
acceptable:  
 
• documentation that the service member has  already re -enlisted or 
extended his/her period of acti ve duty to a date beyond the 12-month  
period following the projected closing of the loan, or  
• documentation that the service member has already re -enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active -duty servi ce to a date beyond the  
12-month  period following the projected closing of the loan, or  
• verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income following the release from 
active -duty service , or 
• verific ation of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income fo llowing the release from 
active -duty service , or

continued  • a statement from the service member that he/she intends to re -enlist or 
extend his/her period of active -duty service to a date beyond the 12 -
month period, plus (1) a statement from the service member’s 
commanding officer confirming that th e service member is eligible to 
re-enlist or extend his/her active -duty service  as indicated, and (2) the 
commanding officer has no reason to believe that such re -enlistment or 
extension of active -duty service  will not be granted, or  
• documentation of other unusual strong positive underwriting factors, 
such as a downpayment of at least 10 percent from the borrower’s own 
assets (not a gift),  a minimum of 6 months PITI, in cash, after the 
downpayment from the borrow er’s own assets (not a gift) or clear 
evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a non -military 
spouse’s income so high that only minimal income from the active -duty 
service member is needed to qualify.  
 
If an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, 
the above documentation is not required unless there is evidence that the 
Officer has resigned his or her commission.   
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates her ETS dat e listed on her 
LES is 171031 (October 31, 2017) and the projected date of closing is October 
1, 2017.  Therefore, one of the above items is needed to verify future income 
since her ETS date is less than 12 months from the projected date of closing.  
 
Examp le: A member of the Reserves has been called to Active Duty.  The 
ETS date on his LES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active 
duty orders indicate his active duty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.  
Therefore, since he will be leaving active  duty before 12 months of the 
projected closing date, the active -duty income cannot be considered, and his 
civilian employment and drill duty will need to be considered.  
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicat es his ETS date is less than 1  
month from the anticipated date of closing, and he indicates he will be 
receiving military retirement and has accepted civilian employment.  Verify 
his future retirement income from the Department of Defense and verify future 
civilian employment with the Vete ran’s new employer.

whether the borrower’s anticipated source of income is stable and reliable,

In most areas , there will be an additional variable housing allowance, which 
can also be included. The military quarters and variable housing allowances 
are not taxable income. The lender must verify the amount of BAH the 
Veteran will re ceive.  The BAH amount will change from one duty station to 
another.

Clothing Allowances  
 
Any subsistence (rations) and clothing allowan ces are indicated on the LES. 
The lender may include verified allowances in effective income.  These 
allowances are not  taxable income. The clothing allowance generally appears 
on the LES as an annual amount.  Convert the annual amount to a monthly 
amount for the Loan Analysis.  
 
Verification and Analys is of Other Military Allowances  
 
To consider a military allowance in the underwriting analysis, obtain 
verification of the type and amount of the military allowance, how long the 
borrower has r eceived it and the continuance into the foreseeable future.  
 
Military allowances may be included in effective income only  if such income 
can be expected to continue because of the nature of th e borrower’s assigned 
duties.  Such allowances include , but are not limited to:  
 
• proficiency pay, such as linguistic, parachute, scuba,  flight or hazard 
pay, and  
• overseas or combat pay (sea pay, submarine, etc.)  
 
All types of allowances above are subject to periodic review and/or testing of 
the recipient to ascertain  whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if 
it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be 
expected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, 
should the income be added to base pay. Co ntact the borrower’s chain of 
command if there are questions regarding  the continuance of the income.  
 
If the duration of the military allowance cannot be determined, this source of 
income may still be used to offset short term obligations of 6 to 24 month s 
duration.  
 
Consult the IRS to determine if any allowances for pay are considered taxable 
income by the IRS, unlike housing, clothi ng, and subsistence allowances.

l. Income and 
Analysis of 
Income from 
Service in the 
Reserves or 
National Guard  Income derived from service in the Reserves or National Guard may be used if 
the borrower has served in such capacity for a period of time sufficient to 
indicate a  good probability that such income will continue beyond 12 months. 
The total period of active -duty and reserve service may be helpful in this 
regard.  Otherwise, this income may be used to offset obligations of 6 to 24 
months du ration.  
 
Income from Recently Activated Members of the Reserve or National 
Guard  
 
Lenders must consider if a borrower, whose income is being used to qualify 
for a loan, may have a change in income due to participation in a 
Reserves/National Guard unit subject to activation.  
 
If an activated Reserves/National Guard member applies for a loan, they must 
present orders indicating their current active duty tour is not to exceed 12 
months.   
 
Example : The borrower’s full -time civilian employment is $3,000 per month.  
The borrower’s current income from the Reserves due to activation is $3,500 
per month and orders are for 12 months.  Since the borrower’s full -time 
civilian employment is only $3,000 per month, the $3,000 shou ld be used to 
qualify the borrower.  
 
There are not any clear -cut procedures that can be applied to all cases.  
Evaluate all aspects of each individual case, including credit history, 
accumulation of assets, overall employment history, and make the best 
decision for each loan regarding the use of income in qualifying for the loan.  
 
It is very important that loan files be carefully and thoroughly documented, 
including any reasons for using or not using Reserve/National Guard income 
in these situations.  
 
As a lender, the goal is to provide the Veteran their benefit without placing 
him/her in a financial hardship.

include  if the Veteran : 
 
• will be discharging within the next 6 months from the military and has 
completed a Physical Exam Board (PEB) or Medical Review B oard 
(MEB) and will be filing for VA disability while still on active duty,  
• has recently filed for VA disability and VA ’s Compensation Service

continued  Analysis of Prospects for Continued Employment  
 
Cases involving recently discharged Veterans often require the underwriter to 
exercise a great deal of judgment and flexibility in determining whether the 
employment income will continue in the foreseeable future.  This is because 
some Veterans may have little or no employment experience oth er than their 
military occupation.   
 
Continuity of employment is essential for a Veteran with no retirement 
income , or insufficient retirement income , to support the loan obligation.  If 
the duties the borrower performed in the military are similar or dir ectly related 
to the duties of the present position, use this as one indicator that the 
employment is likely to continue.  
 
Most cases fall somewhere between these extremes.  Fully develop the facts of 
each case to make a determination.  The guidelines unde r Self -Employmen t 
Income in Topic 2, subsection j of this chapter provide guidance for a recently

Verification of Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Home  
 
Obtain a copy of the rental agreement for the property, if any.  
 
Analysis using Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Loan  
 
Use the prospective rental income only to offset the mortgage payment on the 
rental property , and only if there is not an indication that the property will be 
difficult to rent. This rental income may not be included in effective income.  
 
Obtain a working knowledge of the local rental market.  If there is not a lease 
on the propert y, but the local rental market is very strong, the lender may still 
consider the prospective rental income for offset purposes.  Provide a 
justification on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis.  
    
Reserves are not needed to offset the mortgage payment on the property the 
Veteran occupies prior to the new loan.  
 
Example : The Veteran’s current home has a VA mortgage with a monthly 
PITI payment of $1,000.  Bonus entitlement is being used to purcha se a new 
primary residence and the Veteran will rent the previous home for $1,200 
monthly upon closing of the new home.  The payment of $1,200 can be used 
to offset the existing mortgage payment, if all the above conditions are met.  
The additional rent re ceived in excess of the mortgage payment cannot be used 
as effective income.  
 
Verification of Rental Property Income  
 
Obtain the following:  
 
• documentation of cash reserves totaling at least 3 months mortgage 
payments (PITI), and  
• individual income tax returns, signed and dated or lender obtained tax 
transcripts, plus all applicab le schedules for the previous 2 years, 
which show rental income generated by the property.

documented for each  property to consider the rental income.  
 
If there i s not a lien on the property, 3 months reserves to cover expenses such 
as taxes, hazard insurance, flood insu rance, homeowner’s  association f ees, and 
any other recurring fees should be documented for the property(ies).  
 
Equity in the property cannot  be used as reserves.  
 
Cash proceeds from a VA refinance cannot be counted as the required PITI on 
a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the borrower’s account before 
the new VA loan closes.  
 
Gift funds cannot be use d to meet reserve requiremen ts. 
 
Analysis of Rental Property Income  
 
Each property(ies) must have a 2-year rental history itemized on the 
borrower’s tax return.  
 
Property depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns may be 
included in effective income.  
 
If after adding depreciation to the negative rental income, the borrower still 
has rental loss, the negative income should be deducted from the overall 
income as it reduces the borrower’s income.  
 
If rental income will not , or cannot be used, then the full mortgage paymen t 
should be considered and reserves do not need to be considered.

For purposes of determining the VA guaranty, lenders are instructed to 
reference only the One -Unit Limit column in the FHFA Table “Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac Maximum Loan Limits for Mortgages, located at 
https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads.

Include the prospective rental income in effective income only if:  
 
• the borrower has a reasonable likelihood of success as  a landlord, and  
• cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI).  
 
If each unit is separate and not under one mortgage, 6 months PITI must be 
verified for each separate unit.  
 
Equity in the property cannot be used as reserves to meet PITI  requirements.  
This must be the bo rrower’s own funds, not a gift.  
 
Cash proceeds from a VA regular “Cash -Out” refinance cannot be counted as 
the required PITI on a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the

q. Automobile 
or Similar 
Allowances  Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related 
to a borrower’s employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset 
a corresponding car payment.  However, if the borrower reports an allowance 
as part of monthly quali fying income, it must be determined if the automobile 
expense reported on IRS Form 2106  should be deducted from income or 
treated as a liability.  
 
If the reported expense is less than the automobile  allowance, the amount can 
be treated as income and added to borrower’s monthly income.  
 
If the reported expense exceeds the automobile allowance, the amount must be 
deducted from income as a net calculation in Section D on VA Form 26 -6393 , 
Loan Analysis . 
 
Likewise, any other similar type of allowance received by the borrower should 
be considered with regards to the tax returns for determination of an offset of 
the corresponding obligatio n, as income, or as an expense.

r. Other Types 
of Income  While not all types of income can be listed, documentation of income must 
support the history of receipt and the likelihood or continuan ce of the income 
for at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date to include in effective 
income.  Otherwise, consider whether it is reasonable to use the income to 
offsets short term obli gations of 6 to 24 months duration.  
 
“Other” types of income which may be considered as effective income 
include, but are not limited to:  
 
• pension or other retirement benefits,  
• disability income,  
• dividends from stocks or other,  
• interest from bonds, savin gs accounts, or others,  
• royalties , 
• notes receivable, and  
• trusts  
 
VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance.  A COE will generally have the 
amount of VA disability income listed, however , see Topic 2, subsection m of 
this chapter for exceptions.  
 
A VA award letter or bank statement may also verify the current monthly 
amount received.  
 
The lender may include verified income from public assistance programs in 
effective income if evidence indicates it will likely  continue for 3 years or 
more.  
 
The lender may include workers’ compensation income th at will continue for 
at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date if the borrower chooses to 
reveal it.  
 
The lender may include verified income received specifically for the care of 
any foster child(ren) , only to balance the expenses of caring for the foster 
child(ren) against any i ncreased residual requirements.

r. Other Types 
of Income , 
continued  Example : The borrower(s) receive a stipend paid by the county or State for 
two foster children living in the residence.  Instead o f considering a family size 
of four, a family size of two  should be used to determine the residual income 
requirement.  
Do not include temporary income items such as VA educational allowances 
(including the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefit) and unemployment compensation in 
effective income.   
Exception : If unemployment compensation is a regular part of a borrower’s 
income due to the nature of his/her employment ( for example, seasonal work), 
it may be included.  
 
A borrower in receipt of V A Pension or  Disability benefits with Aid and 
Attendance should be discussed with the VA Pension Service , VA 
Compensation Service , or the VA Hospital where the property is located , to 
determine if the  income is likely to continue for  the foreseeable future.   
 
If a borrower has a contract for employment in a foreign country (whether or 
not the employer is a US company or corporation) , the income can be used if it 
is verified, stable , and reliable.  While some contracts are renewed yearly, 
consider the borrower’s past employment history and the likelihood of the 
contract being extended.   
 
Income that is paid by a foreign employer or government in foreign currency 
shou ld be converted to US dollars.

Change Date   
February 22, 2019   
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
 
a. Income Tax 
and Social 
Security 
Deductions   
Determine the appropriate deductions for Federal income tax and Social 
Security using the “Employer’s Tax Guide”, Circular E , issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS).   
 
Determine the appropriate deductions for state and local taxes using similar 
materials provided by the states.   
 
The income tax should be based upon the borrower’s residence and what is 
documented in the guide to the IRS, and not solely the amount claimed  on the 
paystub.  
 
An active -duty service member’s LES may have a different state tax deduction 
than the state where the active -duty service member  will be purchasing a 
residence or refinancing.  Select the state listed on the LES for the state taxes 
to be co nsidered in state tax deductions.  
 
The lender may consider the borrower’s potential tax benefits from obtaining 
the loan (for example, mortgage interest deduction) in the analysis.  To do so:  
 
• determine what the borrower’s withholding allowance will be, usi ng 
the instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W -4, Employee’s 
Withholding Allowance Certificate, and  
• apply that withholding number when calculating Federal and state 
income tax deductions on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , then  
• document the change in deductions in Item 47, Remarks, on VA Form 
26-6393 , Loan Analysis .

b. Income Tax 
Credits from 
Mortgage 
Credit 
Certificates 
(MCC)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MCCs issued by state and local governments may qualify a borrower for a 
Federal tax credit.  The Federal tax credit is based on a certain percentage of 
the borrower’s mortgage interest payment.  Lenders must provide a copy of 
the MCC to VA with the loan package which indicates:  
 
• documentation verifying any expenses charged by the local 
government entity for the program which is listed on the Closing 
Disclosure Statement,  and 
the percentage to be used to calculate the tax credit, and if applicable, the 
amount of the indebtedness.  The certified indebtedness can be comprised of a 
loan incurred by the  borrower to acquire a principal residence or a qualified 
home improvement rehabilitation loan.  
 
There is an IRS annual limit on the tax credit equal to the lesser of the 
borrower’s maximum tax liability or $2,000.  Calculate the tax credit by 
applying the  specified percentage to the interest paid on the certified 
indebtedness.  Then apply the annual limit.  
  
Example : The MCC shows a 30 percent rate and $100,000 certified 
indebtedness.  The borrower will pay approximately $8,000 in annual 
mortgage interest.   The borrower’s estimated total Federal income tax liability 
is $9,000.  Calculate the tax credit as follows:  
 
Step Procedure  
1 30 percent of $8,000 = $2,400  
2 Apply the IRS annual $2,000 limit  
3 The tax credit will be $2,000  
This allows use of $167 (one-twelfth of $2,000) as income to qualify the 
borrower.  
 
If the mortgage on which the borrower pays interest is greater than the amount 
of certified indebtedness, limit the interest used in the tax credit calculation to 
that portion attributable to the  certified indebtedness.  
 
Since these programs are offered by state and local government(s), pre -
approval by VA is not required for the borrower to participate in the program.  
The lender is responsible to determine all eligibility requirements are met by 
the borrower to participate in the program.

a. Assets and 
Amount of 
Cash Required 
for Closing  February 22, 2019  
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
 
The borrower(s)  must have sufficient cash assets to cover:  
 
• any closing costs, pre -paids, or discount points which are the 
borrower’s responsibility and are not financed into the loan, and  
• the difference between the sales price and the loan amount, if the sales 
price exc eeds the reasonable value established by VA (i.e. negative 
equity).   
 
VA does not require the borrower(s) to have additional cash to cover a certain 
number of mortgage payments, unplanned expenses or other co ntingencies on 
the residence, or re finance of th e Veteran’s  residence.   
 
However, the borrower’s ability to accumulate liquid assets and the current 
availability of liquid assets for unplanned expenses should be considered in the 
overall credit analysis.  
 
Reserves are required for borrowers using renta l income to qualify.  See Topic 
2, subsection n of this c hapter  for more information .   
 
A rental offset does not require additional assets  to cover PITI.  See Topic 2, 
subsection n of this c hapter  for more information .   
 
The assets securing a loan(s) against deposited funds (signature loans, cash 
value life insurance policies, 401(k) loans, other) may not be included as an 
asset on the VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis .  See Topic 5 of this chapter for

b. Verification 
of Assets and 
Cash to Close 
Requirements  Verify all liquid assets owned by the borrower(s) to the extent they are needed 
to close the loan.  In addition, verify any liquid assets that may have a bearing 
on the o verall credit analysis (significant assets). Use VA Form 26 -8497a , 
Request for Verification of Deposit , or electronic, or certified copies of the 
borrower’s last two bank statements.  
 
Verifications must be no more 120 days old  (180 days for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the deposit verification 
is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the deposit verification is 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new co nstruction).  
 
c. Pending Sale 
of Real Estate  In some cases, the determination that the income and/or assets of borrowers 
are needed to qualify for the loan d epends upon the sale of presently the 
borrower’s owned real property.   
 
The sale proceeds may be necessary to:  
 
• clear the outstanding mortgage(s) against the property,  
• pay outstanding consumer obligations,  
• make a down payment or pay closing costs on the V A loan, and/or  
• restore previously used VA entitlement.  
 
Evidence the sale has been completed should be included  in the closing 
package to verif y proceeds from the sale.    
 
As an alternative, the Veteran may sell the property with the buyer assuming 
the o utstan ding mortgage obligation.  See C hapter 6 of th is handbook for 
assumptions (Release of Liability) with a Substitution of Entitlement to restore 
previously used entitlement.  
 
See C hapter 5 of th is handbook for prior approval loans, which depend upon 
the sale of property for the borrower to qualify.

Change Date  
 
 
 
a. Verification 
Requirements 
for Debts and 
Obligations  February 22, 2019  
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
 
All debts and obligations of the borrowers’ must be verified and rated. Obtain 
a credit report with all information for all credit  bureaus.   See Topic 7, 
subsection a of this c hapter for details on the type of credit report required.   
For obligations not included on the credit report which are revealed on the 
application or t hrough other means, the lender must obtain a verification of 
payment history showing the obligation or other written verification directly 
from the creditor, including the payment amount and outstanding balance.  
The lender must also separately verify acco unts listed as “will rate by mail 
only” or “need written authorization.”  
 
When a pay stub(s) or LES indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate 
the nature of the allotment to determine whether the allotment is related to a 
debt or other obligation( s).  Examples may include 401K obligation or 
repayment, child care, child support, or other.  
 
For obligations that have not been rated on the credit report or elsewhere, 
obtain the verification and rating directly from the creditor.  Include a written 
explanation for any obligation that is not rated.  
 
Resolve all discrepancies prior to closing.  If the credit report, deposit 
verification, bank statement, or pay stub(s) reveals any debts or obligations 
which were not divulged by the borrowers):  
 
• obtain clar ification as to the status of such debts from the borrower(s), 
then 
• verify any remaining discrepancies with the creditor.  
 
Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old  (180 days 
for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans,  this means the date of the credit report or 
verification is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the credit report or verification 
is within 120 days of the date  the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new construction).

Requirements 
for Debts and

continued  ECOA prohibits requests for, or consideration of, credit history and liability 
information of a spouse who will not be contractually obligated on  the loan , 
except:  
 
• if the borrower(s) is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance 
payments from the spouse (or former spouse), or  
• in community property states . 
 
If either of these situations is applicable , the lender must:  
 
• Obtain a credit report  on the non -purchasing spouse in addition to the 
Veteran’s credit report.  
• Consider the spouse’s credit history in reaching a determination.  A 
Veteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a 
satisfactory risk even though  the non -purchasing spouse’s credit may 
be unsatisfactory.  
• Include the monthly payment of the non -purchasing spouse’s debts on 
the VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis . For debts such as judgm ents and 
unpaid collection accounts, lenders should consider the Veteran’s 
capacity to address the debt(s).  
• Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the 
spouse’s credit report, such as where the judgment was filed and 
whether the parties  were married to one another at the time, and secure 
a competent legal opinion whether the judgment may become a lien 
against the property . 
• Exclude the monthly payment on the spouse’s debts from the loan 
analysis when a reliable source of income for the sp ouse is verified to 
reach such a conclusion which is voluntarily provided.  
• Document VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , with an explanation of 
facts and determination when concluding credit worthiness of the 
Veteran or excluding obligations of the non -purchasing spouse.

b. Verification 
of Alimony and 
Child Support 
Obligations  The payment amount of any alimony and/or child support obligation of the 
borrower must  be verified.  
 
Do not request documentation of a borrower’s divorce unless it is necessary to 
verify the amount of a ny alimony or child support liability indicated by the 
borrower.  If, however, in the routine course of processing the loan, the lender 
encounters direct evidence (such as, in the credit report) that a child support or 
alimony obligation exists, they shoul d make any inquiries necessary to resolve 
discrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification.  
 
Spousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26 -
6393 , Loan Analysis . 
 
Child support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan 
Analysis . 
 
c. Analysis of 
Debts and 
Obligations  Significant debts and obligations include:  
 
• debts and obligations with a remaining term of 10  months or more; that  
is, long -term obligations, and  
• accounts with a term  of less than 10 months that require payments so 
large as to cause a severe impact on the family’s resources for any 
period of time.  
 
Example : Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a 
remaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months, 
would be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a 
severe impact on the family’s resources durin g the first, most critical, months 
of the home loan.  
 
Determine whether debts and obligations which do  not fit the description of 
“significant” should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an 
impact on the borrower’s ability to prov ide for fa mily living expenses.  
                                                                                                  Continued on next page

Veteran may do so without regard to the spouse’s debts and obligations in a 
non-community property state.  However, in community property states, the 
spouse’s debts and obligations must be considered even if the Veteran wishes 
to obtain the loan in his o r her name only.  See Topic 2, subsection c of this 
chapter.  
 
Debts assigned to an ex -spouse  by a divorce decree will not generally be 
charged against a borrower.  This includes  debts that are now delinquent.  
 
d. Borrower(s) 
as Co -
obligor/Co -
signor on a 
Loan or 
Obligations  The borrower(s) may have a contingent liability based on co -signing a loa n. 
The lender may exclude the loan payments from the monthly obligations 
factored into the net effective income calculation in the loan analysis if:  
 
• there is evidence that the loan payments are being made by someone 
else and the obligation is current, and  
• there is not a reason to believe that the borrower will have to 
participate in repayment of the loan.  
 
e. Pending Sale 
of Real Estate  A borrower(s) may have a current home and the sale of the real property is 
needed to complete the transaction.  The lender may disregard the payments 
on the outstanding mortgage(s) and any consumer obligations which the 
Veteran intends to clear if available information provides a reasonable basis 
for concluding the equity to be realized from the sale will be sufficient for this 
purpose.  See Topic 4, subsection c of this c hapter for necessary documents.  
 
f. Secondary 
Borrowing  If the borrower(s) plans to obtain a second mortgage simultaneously with the 
VA-guaranteed loan , include the second mortgage payment as a signifi cant 
debt.  From an underwriting standpoint, the Veteran must not be placed in a 
substantially worse position than if the entire amount borrowed had been 
guaranteed by VA.   See Chapter 9 of  this handbook  for VA limi tations on 
secondary borrowing.

f. Secondary 
Borrowing , 
continued  If the borrower(s) provides written evidence that the student loan de bt will be 
deferred at least 12 months beyond the date of closing, a monthly payment 
does not need to be considered.  
 
If a student loan is in repayment , or scheduled to begin within 12 months from 
the date of VA loan closing, the lender must consider the anticipated monthly 
obligation in the loan analysis and util ize the payment established by 
calculating each loan at a rate of five  percent of the ou tstan ding balance 
divided by 12 months.  
 
Example :  A borrower has a $25,000 student loan balance and you multiple it 
by 5%, which equals $1,250.  This amount ($1,250) is divided by 12 months to 
equal a monthly payment of $104.17.  
 
If the payment(s) reported on  the credit report for each student loan(s) is 
greater than the threshold payment calculation above in a above, the lender 
must use the payment recorded on the credit report.  
  
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report is less than the threshold 
paym ent calculation above , in order  to count the lower payment, the loan file 
must contain a statement from the student loan servicer that reflects the actual 
loan terms and payment information for each student loan(s).  
 
The state ment(s) must be dated within 6 0 days of VA loan closing , and may be 
an electronic copy from the student loan servicer’s website or a printed 
statement provided by the student loan servicer.  
 
It is the lender’s discretion as to whether the credit report should be 
supp lemented with this information.  
 
g. Loans 
Secured by 
Deposited 
Funds  Certain types of loans secured against deposited funds (signature loans, cash 
value life insurance policies, 401(k) loans, or other) in which repayment may 
be obtained through extinguishing the asset, do not require repayment 
consideration for loan qualifi cation.  
 
The assets required to secure a loan(s) may not be included as an asset on the

The lender is respons ible for obtaining the necessary title search to ensure 
there are no encumbrances that would preclude the borrower from obtaining a 
loan.  
Generally, VA Form 26 -8937 , Verification of VA Be nefits , is not needed 
unless the COE or new IRRRL case number indicates to submit the form to 
VA before closing.  However, ask the Veteran and any Veteran co -obligors 
(including spouse if a Veteran) if he or she:  
 
• will be discharging within the next 6 mont hs from the military and has 
completed a PEB or MEB and will be filing for VA disability while 
still on active duty,  
• has recently filed for VA disability and compensation , or VA pension , 
and VA has not yet made a determination,  
• would be entitled to receive  VA d isability benefits, but in receipt of 
retirement pay , 
• has received VA disability benefits in the past, or  
• is an unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran (has applied and/or in 
receipt of DIC who died on active d uty or as a result of a  
service -connect ed disability.  
 
If the Veteran falls under one of the above categories , follow the procedures 
discussed in Topic 2, subsection m of this chapter.  
 
When VA returns the form to the lender and the form indicates that the 
borrower has any of the following:  
 
• an outstanding indebtedness of VA overpaid education, compensation, 
or pension benefits,  
• an education or direct home loan in default,  
• an outstanding indebtedness resulting from payment of a claim on a 
prior VA home loan, or  
• a repayment plan for an y of these debts that is current,

• evidence of payment in full of the debt, or  
• evidence of a current payment plan acceptable to VA and evidence that 
the Veteran executed a promissory note for the entire debt balance.  
 
VA may find a repayment p lan acceptable if:  
 
• the Veteran has been satisfactorily making payments on a repayment 
plan in effect prior to the lender’s inquiry,  
• the Veteran’s overall credit history and anticipated financial capacity 
after the proposed loan is made indicate a reasonab le likelihood that 
the repayment plan will be honored and the outstanding amount of 
indebtedness is not so large that it would prevent payment in full, 
within a rea sonable period (approximately 1 year), or  
• the case involves unusually meritorious circumstan ces. 
 
Examples  
 
Consideration would be given to a Veteran with an outstanding/excellent 
credit history and adequate income whose debt balance is too large to be 
reasonably paid out in less than 18 months to 2 years.   
 
VA will offer special consideration to a Veteran’s claim that he or she was not 
previously aware  of an overpayment of benefits.

c. What is the 
Credit Alert 
Verification 
Reporting 
System 
(CAIVRS)?  CAIVRS is a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
maintained computer information system which enables participating lenders 
to learn when a borrower has previo usly defaulted on a federally -assisted loan. 
More information can be found  at:      
http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/caivrs  
 
The database includes default information from the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Education, Department of Justice, HUD, Small Business 
Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and VA.  
  
The VA default information included in the datab ase relates to:  
 
• overpayments on education cases,  
• overpayments on disability benefits income, and  
• claims paid due to home loan foreclosures which resulted in a debt of 
the government (Generally type 2 VA loans).  
 
CAIVRS Procedures  
 
A CAIVRS inquiry must be performed for all borrowers and co -borrowers 
(Veteran or non -Veteran) on all VA loans, including IRRRLs. The one 
exception to this policy is that CAIVRS is not required for non -purchasing 
spouses in community property states.  
 
VA ass igns a 10 -digit VA lender identification number (ID) to each new 
lender, then automatically forwards the ID number to HUD with a request to 
grant the lender CAIVRS access.  The lender can begin accessing CAIVRS 
usually between 7 to 10 business days after r eceiving its VA ID number 
assignment.  
 
To register for CAIVRS access for first time users,  please use the following 
link: https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/f57register.cfm . 
 
Please direct questions concerning problems encountered with accessing 
CAIVRS to caivrs_admin@hud.gov .  
 
If the borrower(s) is found to have a delinquent federal debt through CAIVRS, 
the validity and delinquency status of the debt should be verified by contacting 
the creditor agency using the contact phone number and case number reflected 
on the borrower’s CAIVRS report.

System 
(CAIVRS)? , 
continued  The creditor agency that is owed the debt can verify that the debt has been 
resolved.  Documentation should be included in the loan file and an 
explanation must be provided on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis .  It is not 
necessary for CAIVRS to update the number if documentation is included in 
the loan file.  
 
Once screening is complete, enter the CAIVRS confirmation code on VA 
Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , in the space to the right of the “no” block in 
item 46 for purchase and refinances.   
 
For IRRRLs, enter the code on VA Form 26 -8923 , IRRRL Worksheet,  in the 
Notes section.  
 
d. Borrower 
with Presently 
Delinquent 
Federal Debts  When CAIVRS or another source indicates that  the borrower has a delinquent 
Federal debt, the following steps must be taken:  
 
• Suspend processing of the loan application to determine the reason for 
the non “A” number.  
• Give full considerati on to  the CAIVRS information, and any 
subsequent clarifying information or documentation provided, in 
applying VA credit standards.  Any non “A” number received does not 
automatically disqualify a Veteran from using their home loan benefit; 
however, the lender must document and jus tify the approval. See Topic 
7, subsection b of this c hapter for documentatio n and explanation 
requirements.  
• If a previous VA loan is involved that resulted in a debt to the 
government (due to foreclosures, short sale, deed in lieu, or  other), the 
borrower may contact  the VA Debt Management Center at 1-800-827-
0648 or at dmc.ops@va.gov  to make arrangements to repay the debt.  
 
Generally , only type 2 VA loans ( fifth digit of the VA loan number) result  in a 
debt to VA and are reported.  The Veteran’s entitlement cannot be restored 
until the debt to VA is paid in full.

Delinquent 
Federal Debts , 
continued  If the fifth digit of the previous loan number is a  type 6 VA loan, there is 
generally a loss to the government and the loss is not reported to CAVIRS .   A 
loss to VA does not need to be repaid; however, the Veteran’s previously used 
entitlement to guaranty the previous VA loan is not restored until the loss is 
paid in full.    
 
Each agency has their timeliness requirements before removing a non “A” 
CAV IRS finding.  This does not preclude the Veteran or borrower from 
receiving a VA loan if credit standards are me t for VA loans.  See Topic 4.07 b 
(13 and 14) of this Chapter for guidelines after a bankruptcy or foreclosure.  
 
Example :  A borrower suffered a  loss on a FHA loan home loan 2 years ago.  
While HUD has not remo ved the CAIVRS finding as the 3 -year waiting period 
has not passed for FHA, the lender is eligible to continue processing a VA 
loan without an “A” CAIVRS finding due to the borrower(s) meeting VA 
credit guidelines for foreclosures and documented in the loan file.  
 
CAIVRS information is only for the lender’s and borrower’s use in processing 
the loan application.  Only those persons having responsibility for screening 
borrowers and/or co -borrowers may use CAIVRS.  Any other use is 
unauthorized . 
 
e. Treatment of 
Federal Debts  A borrower(s) cannot  be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she is 
presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government until 
the delinq uent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangement 
have been made between the borrower and the Federal agency.  
 
Example :  A borrower has delinquent taxes and payments have not been made 
for several years.  The establishment of a payment plan  after the CAVIRS 
finding has been addressed may not be sufficient to show a satisfactory 
payment arrangement to repay the obligation.  
 
A borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she has a 
judgment lien against his or her proper ty for a debt owed to the Government 
until the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied.

a. Credit 
Report 
Standards  February 22, 2019  
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
Credit Reports used in an alyzing VA loans must be either Three -file Merged 
Credit Reports (MCR), or  Residential Mortgage Credit Reports (RMCR).  
 
The credit report must be less than 120 -days old (180 days for new 
construction).  For automatically closed loa ns and prior approval loans, the 
date of the credit report must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed 
(180 days for new construction).  
 
If an RMCR is used, the standards applicable to a RMCR include, but are not 
limited to, the following:  
 
• The report must be prepared by a reputable credit reporting agency.  
• Each account with a balance must have been checked with the creditor 
within 90  days of the date of the credit report.  
 
For each debt listed, the report must provide the creditor’s name, date t he 
account was opened, high credit, current status, required payment, unpaid 
balance, and payment history.  
 
The report must name at least two national repositories of credit records 
contacted for each location in which the borrower has resided during the m ost 
recent 2 years (separate repository inquiries are required for any co -borrowers 
with individual credit records).  
 
The report must include all available public records information that is not 
considered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act  (15 U.S.C. § 1681) 
such as bankruptcies, judgments, law suits, foreclosures and tax liens.  
 
The RMCR must be an original  or electronic report, with no erasures, 
whiteouts, or alterations.  
 
The report must contain a 24 -month employment and residency history.  
 
VA may decline to accept a credit report which does not meet these standards.  
 
If possible, the cost of the credit re port must be listed on the credit report.  If 
not possible, an itemized invoice identifying the borrower(s) is required to 
verify the cost on the Closing Disclosure Statement (CD) when charging the 
borrower for the credit report.

b. How to 
Analyze Credit  The borrower’s past repayment practices on obligations is the best indicator of 
his or her willingness to repay future obligations.  Emphasis should be on the 
borrower’s overall payment patterns rather than isolated occurrences of 
unsatisfactory repayment.  Determine whether the borrower (and spouse, if 
applicable) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a careful analysis of the credit 
report and other credit data.  
 
VA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.    
 
Rent and Mortgage Payment History  
 
The borrower’s most recent 24-month  rental history and any outstanding, 
assumed, or recently retired mortgages must be verified and rated.  Housing 
expense payment history is often a primary indicator of how motivated the 
borrower is to make timely mortgage payments in the future.   
 
Absence of Credit History  
 
For borrower(s) with no established credit history, base the de termination on 
the borrower’s payment record on alternative or nontraditional credit directly 
from the borrower or creditor in which a payment history can be verified.  
Absence of a credit history is not generally considered an adverse factor.   
 
It may re sult when:  
 
• borrower(s) has not yet developed a credit history,  
• borrower(s) has routinely used cash rather than credit, and/or  
• borrower(s) has not used since some disruptive credit event such as 
bankruptcy or debt pro -ration through consumer credit counse ling.

Analyze Credit , 
continued  Adverse Credit Data  
 
In circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally 
considered to be re-established  after the borrower(s), have made satisfactory 
payments for 12 months after the date the last derogatory credit item was 
satisfied.  If a credit report reveals numerous unpaid collections and/or 
accounts that are not being paid timely, including some which  have been 
outstanding for many years, then once the borrower has satisfied the 
obligations, and then makes timely payments on subsequent obligations for at 
least 12 months, satisfactory credit is considered re -established.   
 
Collection Accounts  
 
Isolated  collection accounts do not necessarily have to be paid off as a 
condition for loan approval.  A credit report may show numerous satisfactory 
accounts and one or two unpaid medical (or other) collections.  In such 
instances, while it would be preferable to  have collections paid, it would not 
necessarily be a requirement for loan approval.   
 
However, collection accounts must be considered part of the borrower’s 
overall credit history and unpaid collection accounts should be considered 
open, recent credit.   
 
Borrowers with a history of collection accounts should have re-established  
satisfactory credit in order to be considered a satisfactory credit risk.   
 
While VA does not require that collection accounts be paid -off prior to closing 
if the borrower’s over all credit is acceptable, an underwriter must address the 
existence of the collection account(s) with an explanation on VA Form 26 -
6393 , Loan Analysis , for excluding the negative credit h istory they represent.    
 
If the collection account is listed on the credit report with a minimum 
payment, then the debt should be recognized at the minimum payment amount.

continued  Charged off Accounts  
 
These accounts are typically collections in which the creditor is no longer 
pursuing collection of the  account.  The underwriter must address the 
circumstances regarding the negative credit history when reviewing the overall 
credit of the borrower(s).  
 
Disputed Accounts  
 
Lenders may consider a Veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses 
regarding unpaid  debts except when the debt has been reduced to judgment.   
 
The underwriter should document the reason(s) for not considering an account 
on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis . 
 
Judgments  
 
Account balances reduced to judgment by a court must either be paid in full or 
subject to a repayment plan with a history of timely payments.   
 
A history of timely payments would be generally considered as making 12 
payments to reestablish credit.   
 
Howe ver, in certain cases wh en a judgment has only been in place for a few 
months, an underwriter could justify on VA Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , a 
shorter repayment history if the documenta tion indicates the borrower 
immediately addressed the ju dgment after it was filed  and began a repayment 
plan.  
 
Payoff of Unpaid or Untimely Debts  
 
For unpaid or debts that have not been paid timely, pay -off of these debts after 
the acceptability of a borro wer's credit is questioned does not alter the 
unsatisfactory record of payment.  A period of making timely payments on 
subsequent obligations for at least 12 months, then satisfactory credit is 
considered re-established .

If a borrower(s) has prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer 
Credit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk 
if they demonstrate 12 months’ satisfactory payments and the counseling 
agency approves th e new credit. If a borrower(s) has good prior credit and are 
participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be 
considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining 
creditworthiness.  Do not treat this as a negative credit item if the borrower 
entered the  Consumer Credit Counseling plan before reaching the point of 
having bad credit.  
 
Bankruptcy  
 
The fact that a bankruptcy exists in a borrower (or spouse’s) credit history 
does not in itself disqualify the loan.  Develop complete information on the 
facts and circumstances of the bankruptcy.  Consider the reasons for the 
bankruptcy and the type of bankruptcy filing.  
 
Bankruptcy Filed Under the Straight Liquidation and Discharge 
Provi sions of the Bankruptcy Law (Petition under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code):  
 
• If the bankruptcy was discharged more than 2 years ago from the date 
of closing for purchases and refin ances, it may be disregarded.   
• If the bankruptcy was discharged within t he last 1 to 2 years, it is 
probably not possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are 
met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation  
1 The borrower(s) had obtained consumer items on credit 
subsequent to the bankruptcy and has satisfactorily made 
the payments over a continued period.  
2 The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the 
control of the borrower or spouse such as unemployment, 
prolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance, 
and so on, and the circumstances are verified.  Divorce is 
not generally viewed as beyond the control of the 
borrower and/or spouse.

If the bankruptcy was caused by failure of the business of a self -employed borrower, 
it may be possible to determine that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk if all 
four of the following are met:  
 
Requirement  Explanation  
1 The borrower  obtained a permanent position after the 
business failed.  
2 There is not any derogatory credit information prior to the 
self-employment.  
3 There is not any derogatory credit information subsequent to 
the bankruptcy.  
4 Failure of the business was not due  to the borrower’s 
misconduct.  
 
Bankruptcy Petition Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code  
This type of filing indicates an effort to pay creditors.  Regular payments are made 
to a court -appointed trustee over a 2 to 3 -year period or, in some cases, up to 5 
years, to pay off scaled down or entire debts.  
 
If the borrower(s) has finished making all payments satisfactorily, the lender may 
conclude that the borrower has re-established  satisfactory credit.  
 
If the borrowers) has satisfactorily made at least 1 2 months’ worth of the payments 
and the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit, the lender may 
give favorable consideration.

continued  Foreclosures  
 
The fact that a home loan foreclosure (or deed -in-lieu or short sale in lieu of 
foreclosure) exists in a borrower(s) history does not in itself disqualify the loan.  
Develop complete information on the facts and circumstances of the 
foreclosure.  
 
You may disregard a foreclosure finalized more than 2 years from the date of 
closing.  If the foreclosure was finalized within the last 1 to 2 years from the 
date of closing, it is probably not possible to determine that the borrower(s) is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are met:  
 
The borrower (s) has obt ained consumer items on credit subsequent to the 
foreclosure and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued period, 
and 
 
The foreclosure was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
borrower (s) such as unemployment; prolonged strikes, medical bills not 
covered by insurance, and so on, and the circumstances are verified.   
 
If a foreclosure, deed in lieu, or short sale process is in conjunction with a 
bankruptcy, use the latest date of either the discharge of the bankruptcy or 
transfer o f title for the home to establish the beginning date of re -established 
credit.  If there is a significant delay in the transfer of title , the lender should 
contact the RLC of jurisdiction for guidance.  
 
Deed in lieu or short sale  
 
For a deed in lieu or sho rt sale, develop complete information on the facts and 
circumstances in which the borrowers) voluntarily surrendered the property.  If 
the borrower’s payment history on the property was not affected before the 
short sale or deed in lieu and was voluntarily  communicating with the servicer 
or holder, then a waiting period from the date transfer of the property may not 
be necessary.  
 
If the foreclosure, deed and  lieu or short sale was on a VA -guaranteed loan, 
then a borrower may not have full entitlement avail able for the new VA loan.  
Ensure that the borrower’s COE reflects sufficient entitlement to meet any 
secondary market ing requirements of the lender.

Certification  Because the AUS will be making the determination that the loan satisfies 
credit and income requirements, cases receiving an “Accept” or “Approve” 
rating will not require the under writer’s signature on VA Form 26 -6393,  Loan 
Analysis (items 49 through 53).  However, the file must still contain the 
Lender ’s Certification referenced in C hapter 5 of the  VA Lender ’s Handbook.

a. General AUS 
Information  February 22, 2019  
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
 
VA has approved Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, Fannie Mae’s Desktop 
Underwriter, and VA approved proprietary lender AUS systems to use in 
connection with VA -guaranteed home loans.  These systems incorporate VA’s 
credit standards and processing requirements.  
 
Lenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases 
processed with approved AUS.  The level of reduced documentation depends 
on the risk classification assigned.  The systems use different  terminology such 
as Approve or Accept.  The tables in this section give a general description of 
documentation waivers.  Please note that the documentation requirements are 
the same for these cases as for non -AUS cases, except for any differences cited 
in the tables.  
 
The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
determine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders underwriter’s decision 
whether or not to approve the loan.   
 
Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.  
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems.  
 
It is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system 
be accurately verified.  The data utilized by the system must be supported by 
source documentation obtained by the lender.  Inaccurate or unverified data 
will result in invalidation of the risk classification.  Under certain 
circumstances, it could also result in a finding of material misrepresentation, 
which co uld affect the validity of the guaranty.

A Veteran has a family size of 3 purchasing a home in Arizona with a loan 
amount of $400,000.  The residual figure will be $990.  
 
A Veteran has a family size of 8 purchasing a home in Georgia with a loan 
amount of $150,000.  The residual figure will be $1,199 (family size of 5 
which is $1,039 adding $80 fo r each additional family member u p to a family 
size of 7).  The eighth  person will not be considered in the calculation.  
 
Special Instructions    
 
Count  all members of the household (without regard to the nature of the 
relationship) when determining “family size,” including:  
 
• A borrower’s spouse who is not joining in title or on the note, and  
• Any other individuals who depend on the borrower for support.  
 
If a dependent is claimed on the Federal Tax Returns, then the dependent must 
be considered as a member of the household, to calculate residual income.  
 
Examples  
 
• Children from a spouse’s prior marriage who are not the borrower’s 
legal dependents.  
• A dependent parent.  
 
Exceptions for Considering All Members of the Household  
 
The lender may omit any individuals from “family size” who are fully 
supported from a source of verified income which, for whatever reason, is not 
included in effective income i n the loan analysis.   
 
Examples  
 
• a spouse not obligated on the title or on the note that has stable and 
reliable income sufficient to support his or her living expenses.  
• a child for whom sufficient foster care payments or child support is 
received regular ly, or  
• a parent who has sufficient stable and reliable non -taxable income.

• there is a clear indication that a borrower will receive the benefits resulting 
from use of military -based facilities located near the property.  Examples

and their family members, or Medal of  Honor recipients.  
 
f. Debt -to-
Income Ratio, 
Item 44  VA’s debt -to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
expense, installment debts, and other debt) to gross monthly income.  The 
following steps are required to dete rmine the debt-to-income ratio:  
 
 
The “Debt -to-Income Ratio” heading in Topic 10, subsection b of this chapter 
contains special procedures to apply if the ratio exceeds 41 percent.  
 
Only the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual 
income.   
 
Care should be exercised to ensure that the income considered tax -exemp t is 
likely to continue and remain untaxed.   
 
Tax-free income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, 
workers’ compensation benefits, disability retirement payments, and certain 
types of public assistance payments.   Step  Description

Item 44 , 
continued  Verify that the income is indeed tax -free before “grossing up.”   
 
Tax-free income may be “grossed up” for purposes of calculating the debt -to-
income ratio only.  
 
• This is a tool that may be used to lower the debt ratio for borrowers 
who clearly qualify for the loan.   
• “Grossing up” involves adjusting the income upward to a pre -tax or 
gross income amount which, after deducting state and Federal income 
taxes, e quals the tax -exempt income.   
• Use current IRS and state income tax withholding tables to determine 
an amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower’s 
actual income. Use a figure of 125 percent  of the borrower’s non -
taxable income when “gro ssing up.”  
• Do not add non -taxable income to taxable income before “grossing 
up.” 
• If “grossing up” is used, indicate such and provide the “grossed up” 
ratio of 125  percent  in item 47, “Remarks.” The actual amounts of the 
borrower’s non -taxable income should  not be adjusted in in line 38.

Loan Analysis  
 
Change Date  
 
 
 
a. Residual 
Income  February 22, 2019  
• This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
VA’s minimum residual incomes (balance available for family support) are a 
guide.  They should not automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  
Instead, consider residual income in conjunction with all other credit factors.  
 
However, an inadequate residual income alone can be a basis for disapproving 
a loan.   
 
If residual income is marginal, look to other indicators such as the borrower’s 
credit history, and in particular, whether and how the borrower has previously 
handled similar housing expense.  
 
Consider the ages of the borrower’s dependents in determining t he adequacy 
of residual income.  
 
b. Debt -to 
Income Ratio  VA’s debt -to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
expense, installment debts, and other obligations listed in section D of VA 
Form 26 -6393 , Loan Analysis , to gross monthly income.  It is a guide  and, as 
an underwriting factor, it is secondary to the residual income.  It should not 
automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  Instead, consider the 
ratio in conjunction with all other credit factors.  
 
A ratio greater than 41 percent  requires close scrutiny unless:  
 
• the ratio is greater than 41 percent unless it is larger due solely to the 
existence of tax -free income which should be noted in the l oan file), 
the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's 
supervisor,  or 
• residual income exceeds the guideline by at least 20 percent.  
 
Loans closed automatically with a debt-to-income ratio greater  than 41 
percent:  
 
• Include a statement justifying the reasons for approval, signed by the 
underwriter’s supervisor, unless residual income exceeds the guideline 
by at least 20 percent.  
• The statement must include the reason(s) for approving the loan and 
list the compensating factors justifying a pproval of the loan.

c. Credit 
History  A poor credit history alone is a basis for disapproving a loan.  
 
If credit history is marginal, look to other f actors such as residual income.  
 
d. 
Compensating 
Factors  Compensating factors may affect the loan decision.  These factors are 
especially important when reviewing loans which are marginal with respect to 
residual income or debt -to-income ratio.  They cannot be used to compensate 
for unsatisfactory credit.   
 
Valid compensating factors should represent strengths rather than mere 
satisfaction of basic program requirements.  For example, the fact that a 
borrower has sufficient assets for closing purposes, or meets the residual 
income guideline, is not a compensating  factor.  
 
Valid compensating factors should logically be able to compensate (to some 
extent) for the identified weakness in the loan.  For example, significant liquid 
assets may compensate for a residual income shortfall whereas long -term 
employment would not. 
 
Compensating f actors include, but are not limited to the following:  
 
• excellent credit history , 
• conservative use of consumer credit,  
• minimal consumer debt,  
• long-term employment,  
• significant liquid assets,  
• sizable down payment,  
• the existence of equity in refinancing loans,  
• little or no increase in shelter expense,  
• military benefits,  
• satisfactory homeownership experience,  
• high residual income,  
• low debt -to-income ratio,  
• tax credits for child care, and  
• tax benefits of home ownership

e. Compare 
Previous and 
Proposed 
Shelter 
Expenses  Closely scrutinize a case in which the borrower will be paying significa ntly 
higher shelter expenses than he or she currently pays.   
Consider the:  
 
• ability of the borrower to accumulate liquid assets, and  
• amount of debts incurred while paying a less amount for shelter.  
 
If a borrower’s application shows little or no reserves  and excessive 
obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in 
shelter expenses can be absorbed.  
 
f. Home 
Mortgage 
Disclosure Act 
(HMDA)  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  (HMDA) data, many 
lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
measures to assure access by minorities and lower income househol ds to home 
mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be aware of 
how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in meeting this 
goal.  
 
Compatibility of VA Program with HMDA  
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a prim ary advantage for 
individuals with low -to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such borrowers.  VA Credit Standards are written as guidelines and are 
meant to be in terpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration all of 
an individual loan borrower’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
Purpose of HMDA  
 
VA encourages underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which 
ought to be appr oved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of 
the credit standards.   
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications for 
every qualified Vete ran.

5-2 1. Processing Procedures 
 
Change Date April 1, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a. Order of 
Completion The procedures discussed in this topic must be initiated and may be completed 
in any feasible order, with the excep tion of the Certificate of Eligibility 
(COE), as long as they are all complete d prior to loan clos ing.  The COE must 
be obtained prior to ordering an apprai sal.  These proce dures apply to both 
prior approval loans and loans closed  automatically (except the procedure 
which specifically refers to prior approval loans). 
 
To avoid delays in closing, it is recommended that the lender take the 
following actions in the very early stages of loan processing:  
 obtain a COE (see subsection b of this chapter), 
 request an appraisal assignment in VA’s web-based loan guaranty 
system (WebLGY), (see Chapter 10 of  this handbook for the steps to 
order an appraisal), 
 initiate the Credit Alert Verificati on Report System (CAIVRS) and, if 
applicable, a complete VA Form 26-8937 , Verification of VA Benefits , 
(see Topic 6, Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook), 
 request a credit report and verificatio ns (see Topic 7, Chapter 4 of this 
handbook). 
 
b.  How to 
Obtain a Certificate of Eligibility Verify the Veteran’s or surviving spouse’s eligibility for home loan benefits 
and amount of available entitlement by obtaining a COE in WebLGY.  It is 
highly suggested that lenders obtai n a COE online through WebLGY for the 
most efficient processing times.  Ve terans may also apply online through 
eBenefits. A COE obtained by the borrower in eBenefits will be in WebLGY.  
This COE can be accessed by the lender using at least two of the requested data points in the system, for exampl e the reference number and Veteran’s 
social security number.  An additiona l or updated COE does not need to be 
obtained or updated unless a change need s to be made to the COE.  Please 
examine and understand the conditions of the COE. Failure to comply with 
the COE conditions may result in an ineligible loan (see Chapter 2 of this handbook).

c.  Establish 
Reasonable 
Value of the Property After ordering an appraisal in WebLGY, the appraisal report is uploaded into 
WebLGY.  The Staff Appraisal Reviewer will review the appraisal and issue 
the Notice of Value (NOV).  A copy of the NOV will be available in WebLGY.  The lender must obtain ev idence of compliance with any NOV 
requirements.  
 
d.  Determine if 
VA’s Occupancy 
Requirement is 
Met Determine whether the Veteran meets VA’s occupancy requirement.  The 
loan cannot be closed as a VA loan unl ess the requirement is met (see Chapter 
3 of this handbook for occupancy requirements).  
 
e.  Underwrite 
the Loan Complete the procedures, verifications, and VA Form 26-6393 , Loan 
Analysis , described in Chapter 4 of th is handbook.  Compare information 
received from different sources and reso lve any discrepancies.  Examples may 
include, but not limited to:  
 
 resolving differences in th e number of dependents, and 
 resolving the amount or status  of monthly obligation(s). 
 The final signed Uniform Reside ntial Loan Application (URLA), VA Form 
26-6393 , Loan Analysis , and final Automated Syst em Feedback, should all 
reflect the same  information.

f. Requirements 
for Active Duty Servicemembers Ensure every active duty Servicemem ber who applies for a loan is 
counseled through the use of VA Form 26-0592 , Counseling Checklist for 
Military Homebuyers , as early as possible in the transaction. 
 
The active duty Veteran’s and lender’ s signature on the form signifies 
counseling has been completed. 
 
Ensure the Veteran, eligible as an ac tive duty member, is still on active duty 
at the time of closing if the COE indicates: “Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date  of this certificate.  A certification of continuous 
active duty as of the da te of note is required.”   If the lender becomes aware 
that the applicant is no longer on acti ve duty, the loan may not be closed 
unless VA re-establishes the Vete ran’s eligibility as follows: 
 
 A Veteran released from active duty must have a DD214  Form 
(member copy 4) with time served, Character of Service Discharge, 
and reason for the discharge liste d. It must be uploaded into 
WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
 A Veteran released from the National Guard or Reserves must have 
evidence of time served and an Honor able discharge. This must be 
uploaded into WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
 If a COE was issued based upon activ e duty service and the Veteran 
has been separated, eligibility must be re-determined based upon their len
gth of service and character of service.   
 
g.  Obtain a 
Certificate of Commitment on Prior Approval 
Loans Upload to WebLGY all prior approval lo ans for review (see Topic 4 of this 
chapter).  
 
Once approved by VA, the Regional Loan Center (RLC) will issue a VA Certificate of Commitment.  Ensure co mpliance with any co nditions listed on 
the Certificate of Commitment  before closing the loan.  
 
To obtain the loan guarant y certificate, the closing package must be uploaded 
into WebLGY, for the RLC’s final review.

 2. How to Submit Loan Documents to VA  
 
Change Date April 1, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a.  Where and 
When to Submit Documents Generally, lenders only need to submit documents to VA when the loan 
requires prior approval or VA requests copi es of the origination package for a 
Full File Loan Review (FFLR).  Lenders must use WebLGY, accessed via the Veterans Information Portal, to submit all requested documents.   
 
b.  VA Loan 
Number A 12-digit VA Loan Identification Numb er (LIN) is assigned to each loan by 
VA at the time the appraisal or Intere st Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan 
(IRRRL) is requested. Use this number el ectronically in VA systems or where 
requested on VA forms and other docum ents.  Submitting an incorrect VA 
loan number can dela y processin g of the guarant y. 
  
c.  Who Can 
Sign Documents for the Lender? Under certain circumstances, VA requi res specific parties to execute 
documents. For example: 
 
 a VA-approved underwriter must appr ove or disapprove a loan for a 
non-supervised automatic lender, 
 an officer of the company must  sign the Lender’s Loan Quality 
Certification. 
 
Where VA does not have a specific requirement, branch managers, 
employees, and agents of the lender or  holder may execute VA forms in the 
name of, and on behalf  of, the principals. 
  
d.  Use of 
Electronic Documents When submitting loan documents to  VA, lenders may use electronic 
documents.  Lenders must be able to provide VA’s audit team members with 
printed, digital, or on-line access to records. 
 
Lenders are expected to continually mon itor the integrity of their electronic 
system to ensure consistent quality a nd to prevent unauthori zed alternation or 
destruction of records.

5-6 3. Prior Approval Loan Procedures 
 
Change Date April 1, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a.  Loans to be 
Submitted for 
Prior Approval Lenders without automatic authority are strongly enc ouraged to enter into a 
sponsor/agent relationship with a VA-a pproved automatic lender to expedite 
VA loan processing and underwriting.  If a lender does not have a sponsor, 
then they must submit an application to  VA for prior approval lending.  Those 
without sponsors or automatic authority  must upload all loans into WebLGY 
for prior approval, except IRRRLs made  to refinance loans that are not 
delinquent (see Chapter 1 of this handbook).  
 
Lenders must upload all prior approv al documents into WebLGY, for RLC 
review (see Subsection c of this Topic) .  A user’s guide for uploading prior 
approval loans is available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/ documents/docs/prior_approval_LP_le
nders.pdf.  
 
All lenders, whether or not they have  automatic authority, must submit the 
following types of loans to  VA for prior approval: 
 
 joint loans, except Veteran-Veteran as a married couple (see Chapter 7 
of this handbook) 
 loans to Veteran in receipt of VA nonservice-connected pension.  This 
is not the same as VA disability – in come based (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
 loans to Veterans who have a VA Fiduciary (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
 IRRRLs made to refinance delinquent  loans (See Chapter 6 of this 
handbook) 
 manufactured home loans (home is  not titled as real-estate) 
 supplemental loans 
 
Note :  COEs may indicate to submit VA Form 26-8937 , Verification of VA 
Benefits .  The form is completed by the VA RLC of jurisdiction where the 
property is located, and will indicate  whether the Veteran receives VA non-
service connected pension or has a VA Fiduciary.  For a list of all VA offices 
and their jurisdictions visit https://www.benefits.va. gov/HOMELOANS/contact.asp .

a. Loans to be 
Submitted for 
Prior Approval, continued 
   
 
    
 
   b. Before 
Requesting 
Prior Approval 
 Lenders with automatic authority may also elect to discuss a loan issue with the 
RLC (of a type not on the above list) wh en issues or circumstances cannot be 
resolved by the lender’s ow n underwriting staff.    
 However, the underwriter must first attempt to contact the VA RLC of 
jurisdiction of where the pr operty is located to discu ss the circumstances with a 
Loan Specialist.    While VA cannot make the final underwrit ing determination without reviewing 
the loan, the VA RLC can discuss VA guidelines found in this handbook to 
assist the underwriter in making a determination.   
 VA cannot address overlays established by a company or investor and the loan 
should not be submitted as a prior ap proval for the lender to overcome any 
company or invest or requirements. 
 The lender must furnish a cover letter with  the uploaded file that states the 
reason(s) for the prior approval su bmission and explains any unique 
circumstances.  In addition, the cove r letter must incl ude the submitting 
underwriter’s name, phone number, e-ma il address and his or her manager’s 
name, phone number, and e-mail address.   Do not use this provision to shift the burden of a loan denial to VA. 
 
 The lender must perform the following step s prior to submitting a loan package 
for prior approval:   
 establish the reasonable value of th e property with the issuance of an 
NOV, 
 underwrite the loan and provide a completed and legibly signed VA 
Form 26-6393 , Loan Analysis , and 
 ensure active duty members receive counseling using VA Form 26-
0592 , Counseling Checklist fo r Military Homebuyers . 
 The loan package will be returned and processing delayed if all documents are 
not submitted with the original upload.

f. VA 
Processing of a Prior Approval Application 
  
VA will review the documents submi tted and complete the following: 
 
 suspend processing and request addi tional information from the lender. 
 send a notice of denial to th e lender and borrower, or  
 issue VA’s certificate of commitment to the lender, which is evidence 
of VA’s approval of the loan to cl ose and willingness to guaranty the 
loan.  
Loans submitted on the prior approval basis have a 10-business day timeliness 
requirement by VA. 
The processing time may be extended fo r loans involving the receipt of VA 
pension income or a Vete ran with a VA Fiduciary. E ither the VA Pension or 
Fiduciary HUB may have, in addition to Loan Guaranty, to provide a review 
of the loan file. 
 
g. Certificate of 
Commitment 
  
VA‘s certificate of commitment must be obtained prior to closing and is the 
lender’s evidence of VA’s willingness to  guaranty the loan.  The lender is 
subsequently entitled to evidence of guaranty if the:  
 the closed loan is identical in a ll respects to that submitted to VA on 
the URLA and described on the certif icate of commitme nt (or, if not 
identical, any required VA approval of  changes was obtained prior to 
closing), and 
 the lender has complied with all a pplicable provisions of the law and 
loan guaranty regulations in making the loan.  Additionally, all conditions of the certificate of commitment mu st be met. 
 If, at any time prior to closing, the lender or VA has reason to doubt the 
continued qualification of the loan, th e lender will delay closing until all facts 
are determined and reviewed again by VA.  VA may cancel a commitment if the validity period of the certificate of commitment has expired (after 180 da ys), and there is no reasonable 
expectation that the loan will be reported for guaranty.   
 A commitment may be extended under ce rtain circumstances.  Contact the 
VA office of jurisdiction of where the property is located for a review of the 
prior approval commitment.

points indicated on the certificate of 
commitment, no VA approval is needed. 
Include with the closing package: 
 
 an explanation of the change, 
 the URLA with changes initialed 
and dated by the applicant, and 
if previously verified assets are not sufficient to cover the additional 
points, verification of sufficient 
additional assets. 
The loan is to be closed at an interest rate 
more than 1 percent greater than the rate 
indicated on the certificate of commitment, VA approval is needed.

 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a.  What are 
Other Necessary Documents?  Other necessary documents are verificatio ns, explanations, forms, etc. that 
are either:  
 required by VA (for example, lender’ s loan quality certification), 
 required by VA under certain circum stances (for example, but not 
limited to POA and alive and well), or 
 necessary to clarify some aspect of the loan or the applicant’s 
qualifications.

5-22 6. Processing Loan Assumptions by the Current Servicer or 
Holder of the VA Loan  
 
Change Date April 1, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a.  General 
Information  If you are not the loan servicer or hold er of the current VA loan, please refer 
the borrower or purchaser to the servicer  or holder of the current VA loan for 
processing.  Assumptions can only be pr ocessed and closed by loan holders 
and services with VA automatic author ity that are holding or servicing the 
current VA loan.    Loan holders or servicers holding the loan without VA automatic authority that are holding or servicing the curre nt VA loan, may submit a prior approval 
package to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. See 
Topic 1 of this chapter.   
A VA assumption is also considered a Release of Liability (ROL).  
 Properties that are security for VA-gua ranteed loans may be disposed or 
transferred even though the loans are not pa id in full. Veterans who dispose or 
transfer their properties under these c onditions remain liable to VA for any 
loss that may occur as a result of a future default and subsequent claim 
payment, unless the proper ty is transferred to a creditworthy purchaser who 
agrees to assume the payment obligation.  The servicer initially determines the 
purchaser’s creditworthiness.

 6. Processing Loan Assumptions by the Current Servicer or 
Holder of the VA Loan, continued  
 
a. General 
Information, continued  Any purchaser may qualify to assume  a VA loan; however, for a Veteran’s 
entitlement to be restored, a Veteran purchaser with sufficient entitlement 
must complete a Substitution of Entitle ment (SOE) when the ROL is closed.  
The Veteran’s entitlement is not restor ed unless the Veteran purchaser, in 
addition to assuming the payment obligati on, also agrees and is eligible to 
substitute their entitlement for the Vetera n seller’s entitlement . It is important 
for the servicer as soon as possible in  the assumption process to obtain COEs 
for both the Veteran assumer and Vetera n seller to determine if there is 
sufficient entitlement in which to su bstitute. See chapter 3 of this handbook. 
 Unless the ROL is an unrestricted transfer , a closing disclosu re is required.  
 An ROL or SOE does not affect th e original issuance of the LGC.  
 
 
b.  Who Can 
Process Loan 
Assumptions?   While procedures for processing requests  for assumption approvals previously 
depended on the date of loan (comm itment made on or after March 1, 1988), 
the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Inte rface (VALERI) regulations authorize 
loan holders or servicers with automatic authority that are holding or servicing 
the current VA loan to be transferre d to determine creditworthiness on all 
assumption approval requests processed b y their servicers. 
 
c.  Servicers 
with Automatic Authority Servicers with automatic authority are authorized to process and determine 
creditworthiness on assumption approval re quests on behalf of VA.  Servicers 
must follow VA underwriting guidelines  (see chapter 4 of this handbook) 
when processing and determining creditworthiness on these cases. 
  Servicers must notify VA electronically of  authorized ownership transfers and 
approved ROLs in VALERI.  Additiona l information on the reporting process 
is available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/valeri.asp . 
 An underwriting and closing package must  be uploaded into WebLGY, for the 
existin
g VA loan number.

e. Transfers of 
Ownership on Properties with Loan 
Commitments 
after March 1, 1988 Transfers of ownership on properties securing loans for which commitments 
were made on or after March 1, 1988, must  have the prior approval of the loan 
holder or its authorized servicing agen t if either of them have automatic 
authority.  If neither the holder no r the servicer has automatic authority, the servicer must 
submit a credit package to VA for underwriting.   A seller must apply for approval of the tr ansfer prior to completing the sale.   
 
Servicers and holders with automatic au thority must examine the application 
to assess compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714 .  VA will make 
the determination in a case where ne ither the servicer nor the holder has 
automatic authority, following receipt of  a complete applic ation package from 
the servicer or holder.  
Continued on next page 
 
  d.  Servicers 
without Automatic 
Authority Servicers without automatic authority that are servicing loans for holders 
with automatic authority must advise the holders of any assumption approval 
requests, and the holders will be  responsible for determining 
creditworthiness.   When neither the servicer nor the holder  has automatic authority, the servicer 
must develop a complete credit package and submit it, along with a copy of the purchase contract and the status of the loan to the Loan Production 
section at the VA RLC where th e property is located.    
 The package should contain a cove r letter indicating prior approval 
underwriting is required as both the servicer and the holder do not have VA 
automatic authority.  See Topic 4, subsection c, of this chapter for the stackin
g order.

f.  Approval 
Requirements To approve the transfer of ownership: 
 
 the loan must be current or will be  brought current at the closing of 
the sales transaction, 
 the prospective purchaser of th e property is creditworthy, as 
determined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook, and 
 the prospective purchaser has agr eed to assume all of the loan 
obligations, including the obligation to indemnify VA if a claim is paid. 
 A processing fee may be collected in advance, including a reasonable 
estimate for the cost of the credit repo rt.  The maximum fee for processing a 
request for assumption approval and cha nging the loan records is the lesser 
of:  
 automatic authority – $300 plus the actual cost of a credit report; or 
 no automatic authority – $250 plus the actual cost of a credit report; 
or 
 any maximum prescribed by applicable state law. 
 VA does not specifically regulate when th e processing fee may be assessed.  
However, when the processing fee is collected prior to signing the sales 
contract, the portion of the fee attributab le to changing the servicer’s records 
(usually $50) must be returned to the sell er if the applicati on is denied or the 
process is not completed.  Therefore, VA recommends that the processing char
ge accompan y the complete packa ge.

g.  Processing 
Time 
Guidelines Automatic Authority: Servicers or hold ers with automatic authority must 
complete the underwriting and notify the seller of the decision within 30 
calendar days after receiving a comp lete ownership transfer approval 
application package.  Without Automatic Authority: Servicers without automatic authority (where the holder also does not ha ve automatic authority) must submit documents to 
VA within 21 days after receiving a complete application package.   VA Review: VA has 10 business days to  complete its underwriting review 
and notify the servicer of its decision.  Servicers have 7-calendar days to 
notif
y all parties of VA’s decision. 
 
h.  Decision 
Notices Approvals:  If the application for ownership transfer is approved, the servicer 
must notify the seller and include instru ctions for the assu mption of liability 
by the purchaser, the amount of fund ing fee that must be paid, and 
documentation needed to complete the process. 
 
Disapprovals: If the application is disa pproved, the seller a nd purchaser must 
be notified.  The disapprova l notice must include: 
 
 the reason(s) for the decision and a notice that the decision may be 
appealed to VA within 30 calendar days, 
 contact information of the servi cer including address, phone number, 
and e-mail of the servicer for VA to  request the underwriting package 
if appealed, 
 if the application was disapproved for credit reasons, the purchaser 
must be informed of the basis on which the adverse decision was 
made in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act . 
 
If the application remains disapproved after 45 calenda r days (to allow time 
for an appeal and review by VA), the $50 fee for changing the account 
records, if previousl y collected, must be refunded.

i.  VA Appeals The seller or the purchaser may appe al a disapproval decision to the VA 
RLC with jurisdiction over where the pr operty is located within 30 calendar 
days from the notificatio n of disapproval.  
 
When the VA RLC receives an appeal of a denied request, VA will request that the servicer send a copy of the a pplication package us ed in making the 
decision.   
 
The loan package must be provided to the VA office of juri sdiction of where 
the property is located wi thin 7 calendar days.  
 
The VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located will review and 
either approve the assumption on appeal  or uphold the decision to deny the 
application.   If approved, the servicer should clos e the assumption w ithin 30 calendar 
days of VA’s approval and submit a closing package to the VA RLC of 
jurisdiction of where the property is located.   
 
If the appeal is not approved, VA’s noti ce will advise the seller of the right 
to request a special approval within 15 calendar days of  receipt of the 
disapproval notice. 
 
Special Approval: Following an appeal to  VA, the seller ma y request special 
approval within 15 calendar da
ys of receipt of the disapproval notice.

i.  VA Appeals, 
continued  VA’s special approval does not releas e any obligor from liability. VA may 
determine that special approval of the assu mption is in the best interest of the 
government if:  
 the seller agrees to re main secondarily liable  on the loan following 
assumption, 
 the seller is unable to otherwise co ntinue payments on the loan, and 
reasonable efforts have been made  to find a creditworthy borrower 
for the property, or 
 if an obligor is releas ed without proper approv al, VA may be released 
from further liability on the guaranty. 
 VA has 7 calendar days from receipt of the seller’s request to make this 
determination.    If approved, the VA RLC will notify the servicer and seller that the assumption has been approved and that the seller will not be released from 
liability to VA; however, the property can  be transferred to the purchaser(s). 
The servicer should close the assumption with 30 days of VA’s special approval. 
 
If disapproved, the VA RLC will notify the seller and lender that the assumption has not been approved, that  the seller will not be released 
from liabilit
y, and the propert y cannot be transferred. 
 
j.  Steps After 
Approval Once approved, the servicer will comp lete the transfer with a loan 
closing that meets all federal and any state and local regulations and 
requirements.

k. Assumption 
Clause The VA-approved assumption clause must be included in the deed 
conveying the property to the purchas er.  The VA RLC of jurisdiction 
of where the property is located has an example(s) of assumption 
clauses that are both acceptable to VA and compliant with state and 
local requirements.  
 
Servicers should contact the RLC of jurisdiction of where the property 
is located to obtain sample language and/or documents.  
 
The servicer is responsible for revi ewing the document to establish that 
it contains the approved assumption cl ause and recording data and that 
it has the legal effect intended.  
 
l.  Agreement 
Creating 
Liability If the seller and purchaser have satisfied all the requirements of 38 
U.S.C. 3714(a)(1) , but the transfer deed containing an acceptable 
assumption clause was not included, the servicer must prepare an 
“Agreement Creating Liability to Holder and to United States” to execute the release. 
 
The servicer must prepare an Agr eement Creating Liability to Holder 
and to “United States” to execute the release.  
 
Three copies are needed for execu tion and must be signed by the: 
 
 seller, 
 purchaser, and 
 servicer as agent for the Depa rtment of Veteran Affairs. 
 
The VA RLC of jurisdiction of wher e the property is located has 
examples of agreements that ar e both acceptable to VA and compliant 
with state and local requirements.

l.  Agreement 
Creating 
Liability, 
continued  Servicers should contact the VA RL C of jurisdiction of where the 
property is located to obtain sa mple language and/or documents. 
 Once received, the servicer is respon sible for reviewing the document to 
establish that it was properly completed and that it has the legal effect intended.   
 
The holder or its authorized servicing agent will then execute the release 
portion of the form.   In those states where recording the assumption and/ or the release 
instrument is necessary, the Veteran may be asked to pay the recording 
fees. 
 
m.  Funding 
Fee   At loan transfer, the purchaser is required to pay a funding fee to the 
servicer equal to one-half of one percent of the loan  balance as of the date 
of transfer. 
 
See Chapter 8 of this handbook for in formation on other exemptions from 
the funding fee and how to verify exemption status. 
 
When the transfer is a re sult of an unrestricted tr ansfer, a funding fee is 
not required.   
 
The fee must be paid to VA within 15 calendar days of the date of 
assumption using the VA Funding Fee Payment System – VA FFPS . 
 
The VA funding fee cannot be financed into the loan being assumed.  It 
must be paid in cash at the time of transfer. 
 
n.  Notification 
to VA Servicers must notify VA after ownership has been transferred and release 
of liability has been granted. Add itional information can be found at:

Servicers are required to retain the supporting docume ntation for all 
transfers, assumptions, and an ROL fo r at least 3 years from approval or 
denial.  
 
o.  Assumptions 
without Prior Approval Servicers must notify VA’s Loan Pr oduction Department at the RLC of 
jurisdiction of where th e property is located (i n addition to the VALERI 
system) within 60 days after learning of  a transfer that did not receive prior 
approval by the servicer or VA.  
 
The notice must advise VA whether the servicer intends to exercise the 
option to immediately refer the case to fo reclosure or to give the transferor 
and transferee the opportunity to appl y for “retroactive approval” of the 
assumption. 
 
Upon learning of an unapproved transfer, the servicer may decide to demand 
immediate payment of the one-half of one percent VA funding fee and 
request a copy of the instru ment of transfer to dete rmine the liability of the 
purchaser. 
 
Loans for which a commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988, are 
commonly known as freely assumable loan s.  Owners have the right to sell 
the property securing these loans under any terms; servicers may not impose 
a restriction, charge, or fee that would limit or nullify this right.  A funding 
fee is not assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988.

o.  Assumptions 
without Prior Approval, continued  Liability assumed.  The purchaser shoul d be afforded an  opportunity for 
retroactive approval of the transfer if: 
 
 the purchaser pays the funding fee, 
 the purchaser has assumed all of the seller’s obligations in the 
transfer deed, 
 the assumption language is legally binding, and  
 it appears that the purchaser inte nds to satisfy those obligations. 
 
When these conditions have been me t, then the Veteran and transferee 
must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 U.S.C. 3713 .  See 
subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the or iginal Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect  the guaranty on the loan. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for a Substitution of Entitlement  to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement 
(see subsection r of this topic).   Liability not assumed.  If prior approval of a transfer was not 
obtained and the title was transferred “subject to” the mortgage or 
deed of trust, then the purchaser usually has no liability on the loan 
and no liability for the funding fee. In this instance, the purchaser ma
y have no incentive to maintain the pa yments.

o.  Assumptions 
without Prior 
Approval, 
continued  The original Veteran seller is sti ll liable if the home subsequently 
defaults and VA pays a claim based on the Veteran’s entitlement used 
to guaranty the loan.  It may still be advisable to ex tend the opportunity to apply for 
retroactive approval of the transfer , with the expectation that the 
purchaser will assume liability for repayment of the loan. 
 
The original mortgagor remains liable  on the loan unless he or she is 
released from personal liability with a qualifying assumption.  The 
Veteran and transferee must specif ically apply for an ROL under 38 
U.S.C. 3713 .  See subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the or iginal Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect th e guaranty on the loan. The LGC 
remains in the original Veteran’s name. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for an 
SOE to restore the Veteran seller’s  entitlement. See subsection r of 
this topic. 
 
An exception applies when the loan was made by a state, territorial, 
or local governmental agency and th e law requires acceleration of the 
maturity of the loan upo n sale or transfer of the property to a person 
not eligible for assistance unde r the special program.  VA has 
approved due-on-sale clause s to allow Veterans to participate in these 
programs and take advantage of be low-market interest rates and 
benefits.

o.  Assumptions 
without Prior Approval, continued  Process for Retroactive Approval.   If the Veteran and current owner 
will be permitted to apply for retroactive approval, the assumption 
process should be completed in the same manner as if the application had been received prior to the transfer.  This includes the right of appeal to VA, if the request is denied. 
 
Should a purchaser fail to coopera te in the retroactive approval 
process, a servicer has the opti on of accelerating the loan.   
 When making this decision, the se rvicer should consider the 
implications of state law when delaying acceleration as compared to the prospect of accelerating a curren t loan that has the potential for 
future timely payments.  Any decision must be reported to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of the 
propert
y and in VALERI. 
 
p.  General 
Release of Liability Procedures VA-guaranteed loans dated prior to March 1, 1988, can be transferred 
without VA’s prior approval, borrowe rs and transferees may apply for 
an ROL before or after the cl osing of the transaction.   
 Servicers with automatic authority must process an ROL when the borrower and transferee specifi cally apply for a release. 
 Servicers without automatic author ity that are servicing loans for 
holders with automatic authority must advise the holders of any 
assumption approval requests, and th e holders will be responsible for 
determinin
g creditworthiness.

Release of 
Liability 
Procedures, continued  A processing charge may be assess ed for reviewing a request for an 
ROL just as on a request for approv al of ownership change on a later 
loan. 
 
When a borrower sells his or her ho me to transfer ownership without 
requesting an ROL, the servicer may charge up to $50 for amending 
its records to reflect a change in ownership, if the parties involved 
agree and it is permissible under the loan agreement. 
 
No funding fee may be assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988.  
 
q.  Release of 
Liability Procedures for 
Divorce A Veteran may seek release from personal liability when his or her 
former spouse acquires the property as  the outcome of a legally binding 
separation agreement or divorce pr oceedings and the ex-spouse was 
jointly liable on the loan with the Veteran prior to the divorce. 
 
Servicers may process requests fo r an ROL from divorced Veterans 
using the same general procedures outlined in subsection a of this topic. 
 
When processing an ROL in divorce cases in which the Veteran’s former spouse receives the propert y, the servicer is authorized to 
charge the normal processing fee to  complete the cr edit underwriting.  
A funding fee may not be assessed.

q.  Release of 
Liability Procedures for Divorce, 
continued  The following requirements must be met: 
 
 the divorce is final and absolu te and it is determined no 
appeal will be taken, or 
 a signed separation agreemen t by all parties based on 
local laws and available doc uments with reasons why a 
separation agreement is used in  lieu of a final decree of 
divorce, and  
 the entire estate encumbered for the VA-guaranteed 
loan has become vested in the name of the Veteran’s former  spouse, and 
 there is not any knowledge of  any property settlement 
that would make the Vetera n liable between the parties 
to pay the guaranteed loan. 
 
Some states require a specific amount of time between a legal 
separation and a divorce (up to  one year).  With proper 
documentation, do not delay the reques t for an ROL, if the divorce is 
not final, but a legal separation agreement is in effect. 
 
In some instances, the ex-spouse may also be a Veteran; however, for 
VA purposes, only the applicant w ho used their entitlement to 
guaranty the loan is c onsidered a Veteran.   
 
For example, John and Mary Do e are divorcing and both have 
obtained a COE; however, only J ohn’s COE was used to guarantee 
the loan.  Since Mary’s COE was not used to guarantee the home, 
only John is considered the Veteran.  If Mary wishes to assume the 
loan, a credit qualifying package is required for an ROL and Mary 
can substitute her entitlement with the assumption.  When the Veteran is awarded the pr operty, the ex-spouse may seek an 
ROL.

q.  Release of 
Liability 
Procedures for 
Divorce, continued  Requests for an ROL from an ex-spouse in cases where the Veteran 
retains the property should be refe rred to the VA RLC of jurisdiction 
over the state where the property is located, to process a Non-Veteran 
Spouse (NVS) ROL.   The servicer will be provided a w ith an NVS letter indicating VA has 
released the non-Vetera n spouse of liability. 
 
The servicer may only charge a fee of $50 for amending its records to 
reflect the change.   It is not necessary for the se rvicer to complete an ROL. 
 
For example, Mary and Jon Smith divorced after they purchased a home using Mary’s COE.  She obtains the home per the divorce decree.  Since she is the Veteran and will be retaining the property, 
she will contact the VA RLC of jurisd iction of where the property is 
located to process the NVS. 
 
r.  Substitution of Entitlement  
A Veteran may allow an assump tion/ROL of his or her VA-
guaranteed loan with the expectation of being able to have his or her 
entitlement restored.  A restorati on may be needed to obtain another 
VA-guaranteed loan in the future by restoring the previously used 
entitlement for full entitlement benefits.  Entitlement cannot be 
restored until VA makes a determination of eligibility for the Veteran assumer and Veteran seller and processes the SOE.  VA completes the SOE process after a servicer closes the assumption and issues an ROL.  Questions about an SOE s hould be directed to the VA RLC 
with jurisdiction where the property is located.  It is important for the servicer to  obtain a COE as soon as possible in 
the assumption process to determine if there is sufficient entitlement for the Veteran assumer to complete the SOE for the Veteran seller.  Entitlement must be of equal amounts  to substitute.  See Chapter 3 of 
this handbook for determination of home loan eligibility.

r.  Substitution 
of Entitlement, continued  When a Veteran requests approval for a transfer of ownership, he or 
she may request to have entitleme nt restored for use on another VA 
loan. For VA to approve such a request:  
 the assumption (ROL) must be comp leted and closed by the lender; 
 the purchaser must be an eligib le Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for th at of the original Veteran; 
 the purchaser must certify that th e property securing the loan will be 
occupied as his or her residence; 
 the purchasing Veteran must  agree to the SOE; and 
 there must be equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran 
in order to substitute his or her entitlement with the Veteran being released of their entitlement.  
The assumption (ROL) must be comp leted and closed by the lender. 
 
The purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for th at of the original Veteran. 
 
The purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be 
occupied as his or her residence. 
 
The purchasing Veteran must agree to the SOE, and there must be 
equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran in order to substitute his or her entitlement w ith the Veteran being released of 
their entitlement. 
 
Whenever two Veterans intend to follow the SOE process, the servicer should have the Veteran purchaser complete VA Form 26-
8106 , Statement of Veteran Assuming GI Loan , (Substitution of 
entitlement).  It should be included in the closing package submitted 
to VA. 
 
A COE for each Veteran should accompany the credit package used to approve the ROL. 
 
It is important to verify the purchasing Veteran has sufficient entitlement, is willing to  substitute their entitlement, and will meet 
occupancy requirements to substitute before the closing of the ROL to 
meet the requirements of an SOE.

remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer 
of rights of occupancy in the property; and 
 a transfer resulting from a decree  to dissolve a marriage, legal 
separation agreement, or fro m an incidental property 
settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property.

Transfers, continued  VA does not consider a sale on an in stallment contract, contract for 
deed, or similar arrangement in which title is not transferred from the seller to the buyer, to be a “disposition” of property as sale agreements are not subject to 38 U.S.C. 3714 . 
 
These sale agreements do not require prior approval from the servicer 
or VA.   
Borrowers inquiring should be cautioned that any borrower 
considering a sale in this manner would remain liable for repayment of the loan under such an arrangement.   
 
t.  Documentation 
Requirements  
VA does not require a servicer to change records, even if the 
agreement calls for the contract purchaser to make payments directly to that servicer.  The contract seller is responsible for forwarding payment coupons and other information to the contract purchaser.  Depending on the circumstances of a case, servicers may agree to change the account address to read “in care of” the contract purchaser, although the contract seller must promptly advise the servicer of any change in his or her address. 
 
Sales by installment contracts typically call for transfer of title after a certain period of time. 
 
If the contract calls for title to transfer prior to payment in full of the VA loan, VA requires assumption approval according to the procedures previously discussed. 
 
Processing charges and VA funding fees will be applicable upon transfer. 
 
As one of the conditions of the c ontract, servicers should advise the 
borrower that the language stating an application for assumption approval will be made, and approval secured, prior to the completion of title transfer. 
 
The contract should address the options of both parties if the request for assumption approval is denied. 
 
Servicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all transfers, assumptions, and releases of liability for at least 3  years 
from approval or denial.  
 
An assumption package should be submitted to the RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located.

6-2   1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs) 
 
Change Date April 10, 2009, Change 11 
 This section has been changed to update hyperlinks and to make minor 
grammatical edits. 
  
a. What is an 
IRRRL? An IRRRL is a VA-guaranteed loan made to refinance an existing VA-
guaranteed loan, generally at a lower in terest rate than the existing VA loan, 
and with lower principal a nd interest payments than the existing VA loan.    
 Generally, no appraisal, cr edit information or unde rwriting is required on an 
IRRRL, and any lender may close an IRRRL automatically.   
 Note:  Exceptions and specific requirements are explained in the remainder of 
this section. 
  
b. Interest Rate 
Decrease 
Requirement An IRRRL (which can be a fixed rate , hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage 
(ARM) or traditional ARM) must bear a lower interest rate  than the loan it is 
refinancin g unless  the loan it is refinancin g is an ARM. 
 
c. Payment 
Decrease/ 
Increase 
Requirements The principal and interest payment on  an IRRRL must be less than the 
principal and interest payment on the loan being refinanced unless  one of the 
following exceptions applies:  
 the IRRRL is refinancing an ARM, 
 term of the IRRRL is shor ter than the term of the loan being refinanced, or 
 energy efficiency improvement s are included in the IRRRL. 
 A significant increase in the veteran’s monthly payment may occur with any 
of these three exceptions, especially if  combined with one or more of the 
following:  
 financing of closing costs, 
 financing of up to two discount points,  
 financing of the f unding fee, and/or 
 higher interest rate when an ARM is bein g refinanced.

 6-3 1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), 
Continued 
  
c. Payment 
Decrease/ 
Increase Requirements (continued) If the monthly payment (PITI) increase s by 20 percent or more, the lender 
must:  
 determine that the veteran qualifi es for the new payment from an 
underwriting standpoint; such as, determine whether the borrower can support the proposed shelter expens e and other recurring monthly 
obligations in light of income estab lished as stable and reliable, and  
 include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceed s the previous pa yment b y 20 percent or more. 
 
d. Veteran’s 
Statement and Lender’s Certification For all IRRRLs, the veteran must si gn a statement acknowledging the effect 
of the refinancing loan on the veteran’ s loan payments and interest rate.  
 The statement must show the interest rate and monthly payments for the new 
loan versus that for the old loan.  The statement must also indicate how long it 
would take to recoup ALL closing costs (both those included in the loan and 
those paid outside of closing).    If the monthly payment (PITI) increase s by 20 percent or more, the lender 
must include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous  payment by 20 percent or more. 
 Example :   
 
 Vet’s monthly payment decreases by $50.00. 
 Vet pays $5,000 in closing costs (include s all costs – closi ng costs, funding 
fee, discounts, etc). 
 Recoup closing costs in 100 m onths - $5,000 divided by $50.  
 Note :  This would not be required in thos e limited cases where the payment is 
not decreasing (reduced te rm of loan, etc.). 
 The veteran’s statement may be combined  with the lender’s certification and 
should be on the lender’s own lette rhead.  For a sample please go to:

Chapter 6:  Refinancing Loans 
6-4   1.  Interest Rate Reducti on Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs), 
Continued 
 
e. What Closing 
Costs can be 
Included in the Loan? The following fees and charges ma y be included in an IRRRL: 
 
 the VA funding fee, and 
 any allowable fees and charges discussed in section 2 of chapter 8 ; such as, 
all allowable closing costs, incl uding the lender’s flat charge. 
 However, There Is One Limitation While the borrower may pay any reas onable amount of discount points in  
cash, only up to two discount points can be included in the loan amount. 
 Although VA does not require an appraisal or credit underwriting on 
IRRRLs, any customary and reasonable  credit report or appraisal expense 
incurred by a lender to satisfy its lendi ng requirements may be charged to the 
borrower and included in the loan. 
 The lender may also set the interest rate on the new loan high enough to 
enable the  lender to pay all closing costs, as long as the requirements for 
lower interest rate and payments (or one of the exceptions to those 
requirements) are met.  For IRRRLs to refinance loans 30 days or more past due (which must be submitted for prior approval), the follow ing can be included in the new loan: 
 
 late payments and late charges on the old loan, and 
 reasonable costs if le gal action to terminate the old loan has commenced. 
 
f. When Can 
the Borrower Receive Cash at Closing? An IRRRL cannot be used to take equity  out of the property or pay off debts, 
other than the VA loan being refinanced.  Loan proceeds may only be applied to paying off the existing VA loan and to  the costs of obtaining or closing the 
IRRRL.  Therefore, the general rule is  that the borrower cannot receive cash 
proceeds from the loan.  If necessary, th e refinancing loan amount must be 
rounded down to avoid payments  of cash to the veteran. 
 The one exception is reimbursement of  the veteran for the cost of energy 
efficiency improvements up to $6,0 00 completed with in the 90 days 
immediatel
y precedin g the date of loan closin g.

f. When Can 
the Borrower 
Receive Cash at Closing? (continued) Note : Use of loan proceeds for en ergy efficiency improvements not involving 
cash reimbursement of the veteran is also an option.  See section 3 of chapter 
7. 
 
In a limited number of situations, the borrower may receive cash at closing.  
Some examples of situations in wh ich VA does not object to the borrower 
receiving cash are:  
 computational errors, 
 changes in final pay-off figures, 
 up-front fees paid for the appraisal and/ or credit report that are later added 
into the loan, and 
 refund of the escrow balance on the ol d loan.  This often occurs when a 
party other than the present holder originates the loan. 
 VA does not set a “ceiling” or a spec ific dollar limita tion on cash refunds 
resulting from adjus tments at closing.  However,  if a situation involves a 
borrower receiving more than $500, cons ult VA as to its acceptability.  
Lenders and VA personnel should exerci se common sense when assessing 
such situations and dr aw from basic program in formation to know the 
difference between an equity with drawal and cash from unforeseen 
circumstances. 
 
g. Maximum 
Loan Always use VA Form 26-8923 , IRRRL Worksheet, to calculate the maximum 
loan amount.  The maximum loan amount  is the existing VA loan balances 
plus the following:  
 including any late payments* and late charges, plus  
 allowable fees and charges (incl udes up to two discount points), plus   
 the cost of any energy efficiency improvements, and 
 the VA funding fee. 
 *Any IRRRL that includes delinquent pa yments in the loan amount must be 
submitted for prior approval, even when a lender has automatic authorit
y.

g. Maximum 
Loan 
(continued) Note :  There is no maximum dollar amount  for VA loans.  Since an IRRRL 
rolls the above items into the new loa n, and VA guarantees at least 25 percent 
of the loan amount (without  regard to the veteran’s entitlement), the new loan 
amount may be more than the limits es tablished by the secondary market.  It 
is the lender’s responsibilit y to ensure it has a marketable loan. 
  
h. Amount of 
Guaranty and 
Entitlement Use No additional charge is made to the veteran’s  entitlement  for an IRRRL; such 
as, the amount of the veteran’s previ ously used and available entitlement 
remains the same before a nd after obtaining the IRRRL. 
 The new IRRRL loan amount may be equa l to, greater than, or less than, the 
original amount of the lo an being refinanced.  This may impact the amount of 
guaranty on the new loan, but not the veteran’s use of entitlement.  
 Example Of New Loan Amount More Than Old Loan   
The existing VA loan was originally  made for $110,000 with a guaranty of 
$27,500, or 25 percent.  The new IRRRL is for $112,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $28,000 or 25 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use 
remains at $27,500.  Example Of New Loan Amount Less Than Old Loan The existing VA loan was originally  made for $42,000 with a guaranty of 
$25,000, or almost 60 percent (the percenta ge applicable under former law).  
The new IRRRL is for $40,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $20,000 or 50 percent, but the veteran’s en titlement use remains at $25,000. 
 
Amount How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL 
IRRRLs 
up to $45,000 First, calculate the  lesser of: 
 
 50 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or 
 the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. 
 The amount of guaranty is the greater of: 
 
 the above result, or 
 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount.

h. Amount of Guaranty and Entitlement Use (continued)  
 
Amount How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL 
IRRRLs
of $45,001 to $56,250 First, calculate the lesser  of: 
 
 $22,500, or 
 the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. 
 The amount of guaranty is the greater of: 
 
 the above result, or 
 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount. 
IRRRLs
of $56,251 to $144,000 First, calculate the lesser  of: 
 
 40 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or 
 the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. 
 The amount of guaranty is the greater of: 
 
 the above result, or  
 25 percent  of the IRRRL loan amount. 
IRRRLs 
greater than $144,000 Guaranty on these is always 25 percent of the IRRRL loan 
amount. 
 
i. Maximum 
Loan Term The maximum loan term is the original term of the VA loan being refinanced 
plus 10 years, but not to exceed 30 years and 32 days.  For example, if the old 
loan was made with a 15-year term, th e term of the new loan cannot exceed 
25 years. 
 
j. Title/Lien 
Requirements The IRRRL must replace the existing VA loan as the first lien on the same 
property.  Any second lien-holder would have  to agree to a subordinate to the 
first lien holder.  
 The borrower cannot pay off liens ot her than the existing VA loan from 
IRRRL proceeds. 
 The veteran (or survivin g co-obli gor spouse) must still own the propert y.

k. Who Can an 
IRRRL be 
Made to? Generally, the party(ies) obligated on th e original loan must be the same on 
the new loan (and the veteran must still own the property).    The lender should contact VA regard ing a proposed IRRRL involving a 
change in obligors unless the acceptability of the IRRRL is clear.  Sample 
cases are provided in the ta ble in this subsection. 
 Examples : 
 In Case 7, the divorced spouse is keeping the home and wishes to refinance.  
The spouse cannot get an IRRRL unless th e veteran agrees to be obligated on 
the new loan and commit his or her en titlement to the new loan.  A person 
without entitlement cannot get an I RRRL or any other type of VA loan. 
 
In Cases 8 through 10, the applicants cannot obtain an IRRRL because they do not include the veteran or a person who was the veteran’s spouse at the 
time the original loan was made, and who was obligated on the loan along 
with the veteran.  In the case of the unmarried veteran obtaining the original loan (Case 8): 
 
 the marriage and death of the veteran occurred after the loan was made, and 
 the deceased veteran’s spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  Thus , 
an IRRRL is not possible. 
 In the case of the veteran and spouse ob ligated on the original loan (Case 9): 
 
 the divorce, remarriage, then death of  the veteran occurred after the loan 
was made and,  
the deceased veteran’s new spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  
Thus , an IRRRL is not possible.

k. Who Can an 
IRRRL be 
Made to? (continued) In the case of the veteran/nonveteran joint loan (Case 10): 
 
 the veteran “sold out” to the nonveteran co-obligor after the loan was made 
and, 
 the veteran no longer has any owne rship interest in the property. 
   Thus , an IRRRL is not possible.

l. Underwriting 
of IRRRLs When Obligors Have Changed Although VA does not require any credit/income documentation or  
re-underwriting of IRRRLs when there has been a change in obligors, lenders  
may want to consider the following: 
 
 Check mortgage payment record in lie u of obtaining a full credit report, 
unless required by investor. 
 For death or divorce cases, obtain a st atement from the obligor(s) on the 
ability to make payments on the new loan without the co-obligor’s income.  
 Obtain a statement about the addition of a different spouse, change in 
number of dependents,  as applicable.

l. Underwriting 
of IRRRLs 
When Obligors Have Changed (continued) The lender should satisfy itself that the lower payment and interest rate, and 
the minimum 25 percent guaranty compen sate for no re-underwriting on the 
new loan when there has b een a change in obligors. 
  
m. Occupancy For IRRRLs, the veteran or the spous e of an active se rvicemember must 
certify that he or she previously occupi ed the property as his or her home.  
This is different than the requireme nt for non-IRRRL VA loans that the 
veteran must intend  to personally occupy the property as his or her home.     
 Reference :  See chapter 3  for details. 
   
n. VA Loan 
Identification 
Number Request a new loan number for each IRRRL through The Appraisal System 
(TAS), without requesting an appraisal. 
 
o. Credit 
Underwriting No credit information or underw riting is required unless: 
 
 the loan to be refinanced is 30 days or  more past due (see section 2 of this 
chapter) or, 
 the monthly payment (PITI) will  increase 20 percent or more. 
 
Reference :  See subsection d of this section. 
 A borrower with a recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy may need approval of the 
trustee for the new loan. 
 
p. Prior 
Approval Procedures An IRRRL can be closed on an auto matic basis by any lender (such as, a 
lender with or without auto matic authority to close ot her types of loans on an 
automatic basis) in any geographic location.   
 
Exception :  For IRRRLs to refinance existi ng VA loans 30 days or more past 
due, VA prior approval is needed (see sect ion 2, subsection a of this chapter).

Change Date April 10, 2009, Change 11 
 Subsections a, b, and c were changed to  remove references  to a 90 percent 
limit on refinancing.  P.L. 110-389, Vetera ns’ Benefits Improvement Act of 
2008, signed October 10, 2008, re moved this limit.

 Subsection d has been changed to remove the $36,000 maximum guaranty 
limit on most refinance loans.  
 This section has been updated to co rrect hyperlinks and to make minor 
grammatical edits.   
  
a. What is a VA 
Cash-Out Refinancing Loan? A cash-out refinancing loan is a VA-guara nteed loan that refinances any type 
of lien or liens against the secured prope rty.  The liens to be paid off may be: 
 
 current or delinquent, and 
 from any source, such as 
 tax or judgment liens, or 
 VA, FHA, or conventional mortgages. 
 
Loan proceeds beyond the amount needed to pay off the lien(s) may be taken 
as cash by the borrower for any purpose acceptable to the lender.    The loan must be secured b
y a first lien on the propert y. 
  
b. Maximum 
Loan Amount The maximum loan amount is 100 percen t of the appraised value, plus the 
cost of an y ener gy efficienc y improvements, plus the VA fun ding fee.

d. Maximum 
Guaranty The maximum guaranty for regular (i.e., “cash-out”) refinancing loans is the 
same as the maximum guaranty for pur chase loans.  Prior to October 10, 
2008, the maximum guaranty had been  limited to $36,000.  However, 
guaranty on this type of loan is now co mputed the same as for purchases (i.e., 
can var y dependin g on location). 
 
e. Veteran’s 
Entitlement The veteran must have sufficient available entitlement for the loan.  If an 
existing VA loan on the same property will be paid off by the refinancing loan, the entitlement used for that exis ting loan can be restored for purposes 
of obtainin
g the new loan. 
   
f. Occupancy The veteran must certify that he or  she intends to personally occupy the 
property as his or her home.  Reference :  See section 5 of chapter 3  for details. 
  
g. Automatic or 
Prior Approval 
Processing Only lenders with authority to close loans automatically may close cash-out 
refinancing loans automatically.  All ot hers must submit these loans for prior 
approval b y VA. 
  
h. Lender 
Procedures Loan processing procedures are virtua lly the same as fo r non-refinancing 
loans.  A full appraisal, credit info rmation, and underwriting are required.  
Generally, follow the procedures described in chapter 5  of this handbook. 
 
To report loan closing, submit all of the documents required for non-
refinancing loans (see  chapter 5 ) plus a statement signe d by the veteran which 
shows: 
 
 the cash proceeds paid, 
 an itemization of the debts pa id from loan proceeds, and 
 the identification of those debts secured b y liens of record.

 1. Joint Loans 
 
Change Date  March 11, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. What is a 
VA Joint Loan? “Joint loan” generally refers  to a loan for which the: 
 
 Veteran and other person(s) are liable, and 
 Veteran and the other obli gor(s) own the security. 
  A joint loan is a loan made to the:  
 Veteran and one or more non- Veterans (not spouse),  
 Veteran and one or more Veterans (not  spouse) who will not be using their 
entitlement, 
 Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, and both 
entitlement will be used; or 
 Veteran and one or more other Veterans (not spouse), all of who will use 
their entitlement. 
 A loan involving a Veteran and his or her spouse will not be treated as a “joint 
loan” if the spouse is:   
 not a Veteran, or 
 a Veteran who will not be using his or her entitlement on the loan. 
 
A loan to a Veteran and fiancé who inte nd to marry prior to  loan closing and 
take title as Veteran and spouse will be  treated as a loan to a Veteran and 
spouse (conditioned upon their marria
ge), and not a joint loan.  
 
b. Regulations The re gulations in 38 C.F.R. 36.4307 address joint loans.  
 
c. 
Terminology Used in This Section   
 
 For purposes of applying the principles ex plained in this sect ion, this term will 
also be used to represent any other type of joint lo an involving at least one 
Veteran using his or her entitlement, and at least one other person not using 
entitlement (can be a Veteran or a non-Veteran, but not a spouse). 
                                                                                         Continued on next page

Terminology Used in This Section , 
continued  Examples  
 
  Three Veterans using entit lement and one non-Veteran 
  One Veteran using entitlement and four non-Veterans 
  Two Veterans using entitlement and two Veterans not using                         
entitlement  
 Two Veterans Joint Loan: Commonly mean ing a loan involving two Veterans  
who are not married to e ach other and both are us ing their entitlement.  
 For purposes of applying the principles ex plained in this sect ion, this term will 
also be used to represent any other type of joint lo an involving only Veterans, 
each of whom uses his or her entitlement.   This may also include loans to the following:   
 The Veteran and the Veteran’s spous e who is also a Veteran, if both 
entitlements will be used.  
 Entitlement and funding fees are se parate. Funding fees are always 
calculated equally by the number of people on the lo an.  It is based on 
each Veteran paying their e qual share of the loan.  
 On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the f unding fee is based on half of the 
base loan amount, downpayment, and sales price for the correct funding 
fee charge. 
 VA will only guarantee the Veteran’s por tion of the total loan amount.  
  
 
d. Occupancy  The Veteran using entitlement on a joint loan must certify intent to personally 
occupy the property as his or her home.  
 
 
e. How Many 
Units Can the Property Have? If a property is to be ow ned by two or more eligible Veterans, it may consist 
of four family units and one business unit, plus one additional unity for each 
Veteran participating in the ownership.  
 Thus, two Veterans may purchase or cons truct residential pr operty consisting 
of up to six family units (the basic four  units plus one unit for each of the two 
Veterans), and one business unit. 
                                                                                       Continued on next pa

e. How Many 
Units Can the Property Have? , 
continued  If the property contains more than four family units plus one family unit for 
each Veteran participating in the owne rship and/or more than one business 
unit, the loan is not eligible for guaranty. 
 
f. Which Joint 
Loans Require Prior Approval?  Any joint loan for which the Veteran w ill hold title to the property and any 
person other than the Veteran’s spouse must be submitted for prior approval. 
 Any loan for which the Veteran and Ve teran’s spouse will hold title to the 
property: whether or not the spouse also  uses entitlement, may be closed 
automatically by the lender with automatic authority.  This type of joint loan does not have to be submitted for prior approval.

g. How to 
Underwrite a Joint Loan The following underwriting considerations apply: 
Type of Joint Loan   Underwriting Considerations Function  
Two Veteran Joint 
Loan Consider the credit and combined income and 
assets of both parties.  Strengths of one Veteran related to income and/or assets may compensate for income/asset weaknesses of the other.  However, satisfactory credit of  one Veteran cannot 
compensate for the other’s poor credit.  
Veteran/Non-Veteran 
Joint Loan  Veteran’s credit must be satisfactory and Veteran’s 
income must be sufficient  to repay that portion of 
the loan allocable to the non- Veteran.  The credit of 
the non-Veteran must be satisfactory.  However, the combined income of both borrowers can be considered in evaluatin g repayment ability.   
 In other words: 
 income strength of the Veteran may 
compensate for income weakness of the non-Veteran, but  
 income strength of th e non-Veteran cannot 
compensate for income weakness of the 
Veteran in analyzing the Veteran’s ability to repay his or her allo cable portion of the 
loan.  
 
__________________ _______________ _______________ _______________  
 
h. How to Calculate Guaranty and Entitlement Use on Veteran/Non- Veteran Joint Loans  
Guaranty is limited to that portion of the loan allocab le to the Veteran’s   
equal interest in the property. 
 
Percentage of entitlement has no bear ing on the amount of the funding fee to 
be paid. (See Chapter 8). 
 
The lender must satisfy itself that the requirements of its investor or the 
secondary market can be met with this limited guaranty.

i. Procedure Step  Action 
1 Divide the total loan amount b y the number of borrowers.  
2 Multiply the result by the number of Veteran-borrowers who will be 
using entitlement on the loan.  There is usually only one Veteran borrower, in which case the result 
of this Step is the same as the result of Step 1.  
3 Calculate the maximum potential gu aranty on the portion of the loan 
arrived at in Step 2 (as if th at portion was the total loan).  
4 VA will guarantee the lesser of: 
 
 the maximum poten tial guaranty amount arri ved at in Step 3, 
or 
 the combined available entitlement of all Vetera n-borrowers.  
5 VA makes a charge to the Veteran-borrower’s available entitlement 
in the amount of the guaranty.  If more than one Veteran is invol ved, VA divides the entitlement 
charge equally between them, if possible.  If only unequal 
entitlement is available, unequal charges may be made with the 
written a
greement of the Veterans.

• the maximum potential guaranty amount  arrived at in Step 1, or 
• the combined available entitleme nt of all Veteran-borrowers. 
 
If the loan amount is greater th an $144,000, additional entitlement 
may be added to each Veteran’s entitlement.  If possible, VA will use this additional entitlement to ar rive at equal entitlement charges 
for the Veterans involved. 
3 VA will make charges to the Veterans’ available entitlement which 
total the maximum guaranty arrived at  in Step 1, or the total of their 
available entitlement if less than  the maximum potential guaranty. 
 VA will divide the entitlement charge equally between the Veterans if possible, or, if only unequal entitlement is available, unequal 
charges may be made with the Veterans’ written agreement. 
 Exception : VA will make the entitlement charge for husband and 
wife Vete
rans accordin g to their preference.

m. Examples 
of Two-Veteran Joint Loans , 
continued  A written agreement from the Veterans is required whenever there is unequal 
entitlement usage. 
 
o. Certificate 
of Commitment For joint loans involving one or more non-Veterans the:  
 
 loan amount shown on the commitment is  limited to the Veteran’s portion 
of the loan, and 
 percentage of guaranty is based on th e ratio of the amount  of entitlement 
the Veteran has available to the Veteran’s portion of the loan.  
 VA will issue the Certificate of Co mmitment with a reminder that:  
 
 no part of the guaranty applies to the portion of the loan allocated to the 
non-Veteran, and  
 in the event of the foreclosure where a loss is sustained, the holder must 
absorb any loss attributable to the non-Veteran’s portion of the loan.  
 
 
 
 
p. Loan 
Guaranty Certificate (LGC) The “Amount of Loan” reflects only the Veteran’s portion of the loan. 
 If more than one Veteran used entitlemen t on the loan, it w ill reflect the total 
of all portions allocable to those Veterans. 
 The lender must satisfy itself that the requirements of its investor or the 
secondary market can be met with this limited guaranty. 
 Whereas the whole loan amount will appear on the mortgage security 
documents; that is, mortgage note or deed  of trust, only the Veteran’s portion 
is shown on the Certificate of Commitment and the LGC.

q. Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act Consideration-s (ECOA) The applicability of the guaranty to only a portion of the loan in the case of a 
Veteran/non-Veteran joint loan may cau se a lender to refuse to accept an 
application for such loan.  This may appear to conflict with th e ECOA prohibition against discrimination 
based on marital status; how ever, the lender may refu se the application under 
these circumstances without violating ECOA.  This is based on an exemption for VA bein
g a special purpose credit pro gram. 
 
r. Calculation 
of the Funding Fee Apply the appropriate funding fee per centage to any portion of the loan 
allocable to a Veteran using his or her entitlement who is not exempt from the 
funding fee. Determine the appropriate percentage for the type of Veteran 
involved from the funding f ee tables in Chapter 8. 
 
Example.  On a no-downpayment loan to two Veterans; on a first-time 
homebuyer; and on a subsequent user; the funding fee percentages of 2.15 
percent and 3.3 percent respectively woul d each be applied to one-half of the 
loan amount. 
 
No funding fee will be assessed on any por tion of a joint loan  allocable to a: 
 
 Non-Veteran 
 Veteran who did not use hi s or her entitlement, or 
 Veteran who used his or her entitlem ent, but is exempt from the funding 
fee. 
 
Downpayment.  The actual loan amount  is allocated equally between the 
borrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a 
downpayment is made, and regardless  of where the funds for such a 
downpayment come from. 
 
 Example.  On a Veteran/non-Vetera n loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000 
(five percent) downpayment out of hi s cash resources, to purchase a $100,000 
property, resulting in a $95,000 loan am ount. The Veteran is a first-time 
homebuyer.  The Veteran must pa y a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5 
percent of his/her $47,500 portion.  If situations arise which are not addressed here, contact 1-877-827-3702 for

7-13 2. Construction/Permanent Home Loans 
 
Change Date  March 11, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y  
 
a. The Basics VA will guarantee a “construction/permanent home loan,” that is, a loan to 
finance the construction/purchase of a resi dence.  The loan is closed prior to 
the start of construction w ith proceeds disbursed to  cover the cost of, or 
balance owed on, the land, and the ba lance into escrow.  The escrowed 
monies are paid out to the builder during construction. 
 The lender must obtain written approva l from the borrower before each draw 
payment is provided to the builder.  The loan will not be guaranteed until 
construction is complete and all Noti ce of Value (NOV) conditions are met. 
 This section does not address other co nstruction loans guaranteed by VA; that 
is, those for the purchase of a residen ce newly constructed for the Veteran by 
a builder who financed the construc tion from his or her own resources. 
 Lenders should have the specialized experience to originate, process, 
underwrite (borrower, project, and builde r), close, service and administer such 
loans.  These types of loans and project s inherently have uncertain elements 
that require careful examination.

b. 
Amortization The Veteran begins making payments on a construction/permanent home loan 
only after constructi on is complete.  Therefore,  the initial payment on the 
principal may be postponed up to 1 year , if necessary.  The loan must be 
amortized to achieve full repayment with in its remaining term.  The lender 
must provide evidence of the amortization in the loan file.  Example.  If it takes 6 months to co mplete construction, the payment schedule 
for the Veteran obtaining a 30-year mort gage must provide for full repayment 
of the loan in 29 years and 6 months.

b. 
Amortization , 
continued  Rather than requiring a balloon payment, it may be preferable to set up equal 
payments (beginning after construction is complete) which are large enough 
to repay the loan within the original maturity w ithout a balloon payment. 
 The VA requirement that loans be am ortized with approximately equal 
payments and the principal must be reduced at least once annually, also 
applies to construction loan s.  However, the final in stallment may be for an 
amount up to five percent of the orig inal principal amount of the loan. 
 
 
c. What the 
Builder Must Pay? On a construction/permanent home loa n, the builder is responsible for 
Interest payments during the construc tion period, and all fees normally paid 
by a builder who obtains an inter im construction loan including, but not 
limited to:  
 inspection fees, 
 title updates, 
 title update fees, 
 hazard insurance during construction, and 
 property taxes. 
 
 
d. Interest 
Rate Lender’s may offer a “ceiling-floor” where the Veteran “floats” the interest 
rate during construction. Th e agreement must provide that at lock-in, the 
permanent interest rate will not exceed a specific maximum interest rate and 
permit the borrower to lock-in at a lowe r rate based on market fluctuations.  
The borrower must qualify for the mortgage at the maximum rate.

 2. Construction/Permanent Home Loans , continued  
 
e. What Fees 
the Veteran Can Pay? Fees the Veteran can pay are described in Chapter 8.  The Veteran may not     
pay any fees that are the builder’s responsibility.   
 
f. Funding Fee 
and Loan Reporting The funding fee is due and payable to VA within 15 days of loan closing; that 
is not tied to the commencement or comp letion of construction.  The loan 
must be guaranteed in WebLGY within  60 days of completion of all NOV 
requirements.   
 
g. LGC Although the loan will normally be cons idered guaranteed upon closing, the 
LGC on a construction/permanent home lo an will not be issued until a clear 
final compliance inspection repor t has been received by VA.   
 
 
h. If Loan 
Proceeds are Not Fully Disbursed If the construction is not fully comple ted and loan proceeds are not fully 
disbursed, guaranty will apply only to the proper pro rata part of the loan. To 
calculate the proper pro ra ta part of the loan: 
 
 take loan proceeds disbursed for construction purposes, 
 add any other payments made to the bu ilder by or on behalf of the Veteran, 
 take the lesser of the above total or 80 percent of the value of that portion of 
the construction completed, and 
 add any loan disbursements made for the purchase of the land on which the 
construction is situated.

7-17 3. Energy Efficient Mortgages  
 
Change Date  March 11, 2019   
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What are 
EEMs? Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) are loans to cover the cost of making 
energy efficiency improvements to a dwelling.  They can be made in 
conjunction with a: 
 
 VA loan for the purchase of an existing dwelling, or 
 VA refinancing loan secured by the dwelling. 
 
Acceptable energy efficiency  improvements include, but are not limited to: 
 
 solar heating systems, including so lar systems for heating water for 
domestic use; 
 solar heating and cooling systems; 
 caulking and weather-stripping; 
 furnace efficiency modifications li mited to replacement burners,  
boilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a reduction in the amount of fuel c onsumed as a result of increased 
combustion efficiency, devices for modifying flue openings which will 
increase the efficiency of the heating system, and electrical or mechanical 
furnace ignition systems which re place standing gas pilot lights; 
  clock thermostats; 
  new or additional ceiling, attic,  wall and floor insulation; 
  water heater insulation; 
  storm windows and/or doors, incl uding thermal windows and/or doors; 
  heat pumps; and 
  vapor barriers.   
 
b. Borrower 
Notice on the NOV Information on EEMs is provided to a Ve teran who applies for a loan which 
requires an NOV (a loan for a home purch ase or regular “cash-out” refinance). 
The NOV includes the followin
g notice to the Veteran:

b. Borrower 
Notice on the NOV , 
continued   
“The buyer may wish to c ontact a qualified person /firm for a home energy 
audit to identify needed energy efficiency improveme nts to the property.  In 
some localities, the utility company may perform this service.  The mortgage 
amount may be increased as a re sult of making energy efficiency 
improvements such as: Solar or conven tional heating/cooling systems, water 
heaters, insulation, weather-stripping /caulking, and storm windows/doors.  
Other energy related improvement s may also be considered.” 
 The mortgage may be increased by:  
 Up to $3,000 based solely on the documented costs, 
 Up to $6,000 provided the increase in monthly mortgage payment 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, or 
 VA does not permit EEMs more than $6,000 ( 38 U.S.C. §3710(d) ). 
  
 
c. Underwriting 
Considerations Energy efficiency improvements up to $3,000: The resulting increase in loan 
payments will normally be offset by a reduction in utility costs. 
 Energy efficiency improvements more than $3,000, up to $6,000: The lender must make a determination that the in crease in monthly mortgage payments 
does not exceed the likely reduction in m onthly utility costs, and must rely 
on locally available information provided by utility companies, municipalities, state agen cies or other reliable sources, and document the 
determination.  Energy efficiency improvements in conjunction with an Interest Rate 
Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL). If the monthly payment (Principal, 
Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI)) for the new loan exceeds the PITI of the loan being refinanced by 20 percent or more, the lender must certify to 
having determined that the Veteran qualified for the higher payment.

Documentation 
Required with Closed Loan Package
 Energy efficiency improvements up to $3,000:  Evidence of the cost of 
improvements such as a copy of the bid(s) or contract itemizing the 
improvements and their cost.  Improvements more than $3,000, up to $6,000: Evidence of the cost of 
improvements such as a copy of the bid(s) or contract itemizing the 
improvements and their cost, and the lende r’s determination that the increase 
in monthly mortgage payments does  not exceed the likely reduction in 
monthly utility costs.  IRRRL with significant increase in paymen ts:  If the cost of the improvements 
cause the new loan paymen t (PITI) to be 20 percent or higher than the old

e. How to 
Calculate Guaranty and Entitlement Use?   Guaranty is calculated on an EEM as  described in the following table.  
 
Step                                                      Action  
1 Calculate guaranty on the loan without the portion attributable to    
the energy efficiency improvements. 
2 Calculate guaranty on the energy efficiency improvements  
portion by applying the same pe rcentage used in Step 1. 
3 Add the results of Steps 1 and 2 to  arrive at guaranty on the entire  
loan. 
 
However, the Veteran’s entitlement will only be charged the amount arrived 
at in Step 1; it is based upon the loan amount before  adding the cost of the 
energy efficiency improvements.  Example 1: If a Veteran has full entitlemen t and applies for a loan of 
$80,000, plus $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, VA will guarantee 40 percent of the full loan amount of $86,000. Thus, the dollar amount of 
the guaranty will be $34,400, even though the charge to the Veteran’s entitlement is only $32,000.  Example 2:  If a Veteran with full entitlem ent applies for a $144,000 loan to 
purchase a home, and adds $6,000 in en ergy efficiency improvements, the 
25 percent guaranty on the loan wi ll only require the use of $36,000 
entitlement, but th e dollar amount of 
guarant y will be $37,500. 
 
f. How to 
Calculate the Funding Fee Calculate the funding fee based on the fu ll loan amount including the cost of 
the energy efficiency improvements.

g. 
Improvements Not Completed Before Closing If the energy efficiency improvements are not comple ted before closing, the 
lender may establish an es crow and close the loan. 
 
 A formal escrow is not required. 
 Only the amount needed to complete th e improvements must be        
withheld. 
 Check the appropriate block in item 23, VA Form 26-1820 , Report and            
Certification of Lo an Disbursement. 
 
 No additional documentation concerni ng the escrowed/earmarked funds 
must be submitted when reporting the closed loan. 
 Generally, the improvements should be completed within 6 months from the 
date of loan closing.  Provide written notification to VA when imp rovements are complete d          
and the escrow funds are disbursed.  Escrow requirements concerning 
completion of improveme nts are listed in Chapter 9 of this handbook.  
 
 Assure the funds are properly app lied to the costs of improvements. 
 If, after a reasonable time, the lender determines that the improvements will 
not be completed:  
 Apply the balance of the escrowed /earmarked funds to reduce the  
      principal balance on the loan, and 
 Provide written notification to  VA that this has been done.

Reimburseme-nt to the Veteran out of IRRRL Proceeds  The Veteran generally may not obt ain cash proceeds from an IRRRL. 
 There is one exception.  Up to $6,000 of IRRRL loan proceeds may be used to 
reimburse the Veteran for the cost of energy efficiency improvements 
completed within the 90 days immedi ately preceding the date of the loan.

Change Date  March 11, 2019   
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Description VA may guarantee a loan for alteration and repair: 
 
 Of a residence already owned by the Veteran and occupied as a home, 
or 
 Made in conjunction with a pur chase loan on the property. 
 
The alterations and repairs must be  those ordinarily  found on similar 
property of comparable value in the community. 
 
 
b. Value 
Considerations  The cost of alterations and repairs to st ructures may be included in a loan for 
the purchase or regular “Cash-Out” re finance of improved property to the 
extent that their value supports the loan amount.

 5. What is a Supplemental Loan 
 
Change Date  March 11, 2019   
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What is a 
Supplemental Loan? A supplemental loan is a loan for the alteration, improvement, or repair of a 
residential property.  The reside ntial property must secure an existing VA-
guaranteed loan, and be owned and occ upied by the Veteran, or the Veteran 
will reoccupy upon completion of major alterations, repairs, or improvements.  The alterations, improvements, or repairs must:  
      Be for the purpose of substantia lly protecting or improving the basic  
     livability, or util ity of the property, and 
      Be restricted primarily to the maintenance, replaceme nt, improvement or  
     acquisition of real property, including fixtures. 
 
   Installation of features such as barbecue pits, swimming pools, etc., does     
   not meet this requirement. 
 No more than 30 percent of the lo an proceeds may be used for the 
maintenance, replacement, improveme nt, repair, or acquisition of non-
fixtures or quasi-fixtures such as refrigeration, cooking, washing, and 
heating equipment.  The equipment must  be related to or supplement the 
principal alteration for wh ich the loan is proposed.

b. Required 
Lien and Maximum Loan Term It is the lender’s responsibility to obt ain an effective lien of the required 
dignity (lien position). 
 
Possible methods to secure a supplemental loan are: 
 
 Through an open-end provision of the instrument securing the existing 
loan, 
 Through an amendment of the exis ting loan security instrument, 
 By taking a new lien to cover both the existing and the supplemental loans, or 
 By taking a separate lien immediately junior to the existing lien. 
 The maximum loan term is:  
 30 years if amortized, or 
 5 years if not amortized.  
 
c. Other 
Requirements The existing loan must be current with respect to taxes, insurance, and 
amortized payments, and must not otherwise be in default unless a primary 
purpose of the supplemental loan is to improve the ability of the borrower to 
maintain the loan obligation. 
 
The making of a supplemental loan can ne ver result in any in crease in the rate 
of interest on the existing loan.  A supplemental loan to be written at a hi gher rate of interest  than that payable 
on the existing loan must be evidenced by a separate note from the existing 
loan.

d. Prior 
Approval or Automatic Loan Closing A supplemental loan will require th e prior approval of VA if the:  
 
 loan is to be made by a lender that do es not have authority to close loans 
on an automatic basis or 
 loan is to be made by a lender that do es not have authority to close loans 
on an automatic basis; or  
 an obligor liable on the currently out standing obligation will be released 
from personal liability by ope ration of law or otherwise. 
 
 
e. Procedures   Submit a statement describing the alterations, improvements, or repairs 
made or to be made with the prior approval application (or loan closing 
package, if closed automatically).   In addition, report the amount 
outstanding on the existing loan as of th e date of closing of the supplemental 
loan in the loan closing package.

continued  If the cost of the repairs, alterati ons, or improvements exceeds $3,500: an 
NOV and compliance inspections are required. 
 
If the cost of the repairs, alterations, or improvements does  not exceed $3,500: 
an NOV and compliance inspections are not  required.  Instead, a statement of 
reasonable value may be submitted.  Th e statement must be completed and 
signed by a VA-designated appraiser.  A VA-designated appraiser is an 
individual nominated by the lender (who may be an officer, trustee, or 
employee of the lender or its agent)  who has been approved by the local VA 
office.    The statement must specify the: 
 
  work done or to be done, 
 purchase price or cost of the work and material, and 
 purchase price or cost does not exceed the reasonable value. 
 
 In lieu of VA compliance inspections, the lender must submit a certification 
as follows:  “The undersigned lender certifies to the Department of Veterans Affairs that 
the property as repaired, altered, or  improved has been inspected by a 
qualified individual designated by the undersigned, and based on the 
inspection report, the undersigned has dete rmined that the repairs, alterations, 
or improvements financed with the pr oceeds of the loan described in the 
attached VA Form 26-1820 , appear to have been completed in substantial 
conformance with related contracts.”

Entitlement , 
continued   VA will issue a new LGC solely for supplemental loans. 
 
 If the supplemental loan will be cons olidated with a related outstanding 
guaranteed loan, VA will issue a ne w modified guaranty certificate. 
 
 
g. Procedure If the Veteran has no available enti tlement, VA can still guarantee the 
supplemental loan provided the lender is  the holder of the Veteran’s existing 
loan and the loans are to be consolidated.  The amount of the modified guarant y will be the maximum guaranty 
effective on the existing loan at the time the supplemental loan is closed. 
 To calculate the percentage of gua ranty applicable to the combined 
indebtedness take the result of Step 1, and divide by the result of Step 3.  
 Follow the steps in the table below to calculate the percentage of guaranty applicable to the co mbined indebtedness. 
 
    Step  Action  
1 Take the balance of the existing lo an at the time of closing of the 
supplemental loan and multiply by th e percentage of guaranty for the 
existing loan, as shown on the guaranty certificate. 
2 Calculate the amount of guarant y that would be issued on the 
supplemental loan as an independe nt loan (do not exceed the amount 
of entitlement available to the Veteran). 
3 Take the balance of the existi ng loan and add the amount of the 
supplemental loan. 
4 Take the result of Step 1 above and add the result of Step 2 above. 
5 Divide by the result of Step 3 above.

7-29 6. Adjustable Rate Mortgages 
 
Change Date  March 11, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. General 
Information Concerning ARMs An ARM loan offers adjustable inte rest rates based on negotiated initial 
fixed interest rates coupled with peri odic adjustments to the interest rate 
over time.  Hybrid ARMs have longer initial fixed rates of 3, 5, 7, or 10 
years, while a “traditional” ARM allo ws for an annual adjustment after 1 
year. 
 
 
b. Interest 
Rate Adjustments Traditional ARMs: Interest rate adjus tments occur on an annual basis.  The 
annual interest rate adjustments ar e limited to a ma ximum increase or 
decrease of one percentage point.  A dditionally, interest rate increases are 
limited to a maximum of five percentage  points over the life of the loan. 
 
Hybrid ARMs: If the initial contract in terest rate remains fixed for less than 
5 years, the initial adjustment is lim ited to a maximum increase, or decrease 
of one percentage point and the interest rate increase over the life of the loan 
is limited to five percentage points. 
 If the initial contract interest rate remains fixed for 5 years or more, the 
initial adjustment will be limited to a maximum increase or decrease of two 
percentage points and the interest rate in crease over the life of the loan will 
be limited to six percentage points. 
 
 
c. 
Underwriting an ARM ARM loans that may adjust after 1 year must be underwritten at one 
percentage point above  the initial rate.  
 Hybrid ARMs with a fixed period of 3 or  more years may be underwritten at 
the initial interest rate.

 7. Loans Involving Temporary Interest Bydowns 
 
Change Date  March 11, 2019   
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. Description As a marketing tool, builders, sellers, or lenders will sometimes establish and 
fund escrows to temporarily reduce a borrower’s loan payments during the 
initial years of the mortga ge.  The borrower may also fund such an escrow for 
herself/himself as a fina ncial management tool. 
 
VA will guaranty loans involving tempor ary interest rate buydowns, if 
otherwise eligible. 
 
A temporary interest rate buydown can  be used in conjunction with any type 
of VA- guaranteed loan. 
 
b. Escrow 
Agreements Funds must be safely escrowed with an  independent third-party escrow agent 
beyond the reach of prospective creditors of the builder, seller, lender, and the 
borrower. 
 
Exception.  If the Federal National Mortga ge Association is the holder, it may 
take custody of the funds. 
 
The escrow agent must make payments dir ectly to the lender or servicer.  The 
funds may be used only for payments due on the note.  The funds may not be 
used to pay past due monthly loan pa yments. If the loan is foreclosed or 
prepaid, the funds must be credited against the Veteran’s indebtedness. 
 
Escrowed funds may not revert to the party that esta blished the escrow.  If    
the property is sold subject to, or on an assumption of the loan, the escrow   
must continue to pa y out on behalf of the new owner. 
 
c. If 
Borrowers Income is Expected to Keep Pace with Payment Increases  The loan application may be underwritten based on the first year’s payment 
amount if there are strong indications that the income used to support the 
application will increase to cover the yearly increases in loan payments. 
 
Routine cost of living increases cannot be used for this purpose. Increases 
resulting from confirmed future promo tions or wage percentage increases 
guaranteed by labor contracts (for exampl e, teachers, and auto workers) may 
be given favorable consideration.

continued  The assistance payments must run fo r a minimum of 1 year.  Scheduled 
reductions in the assistance payments mu st occur annually on the anniversary 
of the first mortgage payment. 
 
The reduction in the assistance pa yments may be accomplished through 
annual payment increases in equal or approximately equal amounts, or equal 
annual increases in the interest rate. 
 
 
 
d. If it is 
Unclear Whether the Borrower’s 
Income Can 
Keep Pace with Increases The loan application must  be underwritten based on the full payment amount 
if there are no strong indications that the income used to support the application can reasonably be expected to  keep pace with the increases in loan 
payments. 
 
The buydown arrangement can be consider ed a compensating factor.  If the 
residual income and/or de bt-to-income ratio is marginal, the buydown plan 
(used to offset a short-term debts), along with other compensating factors, 
may support approval of the loan.  See “Compensating Factors” in Chapter 4 
of this Handbook. 
 
Provide a statement signed by the unde rwriter giving reasons for approval. 
 
The terms of the buydown arrangement are not limited to specific criteria 
such as a minimum or maximum number of years for application of the assistance payments. 
 
It is the lender’s respons ibility to review and dete rmine the acceptability of 
the buydown. Lenders must provide the Veteran-borrower with a clear, 
written explanation of the buydown ag reement. A copy of the buydown and 
escrow agreements must accompany the loan submission.

 amount of the lien(s).   
 
b. 
Underwriting  If some or all of the income necessary  to support the loan payments comes  
from farming operations, th e Veteran’s ability and experience as a farm

Borrower 
  
Change Date November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Policy The VA Home Loan program involves a veteran’s benefit.  VA policy has 
evolved around the objective of helping the veteran to use his or her home loan benefit.  Therefore, VA regulations  limit the fees that the veteran can pay 
to obtain a loan.  Lenders must strictly  adhere to the limitations on borrower-paid fees and 
charges when making VA loans. 
  
b.  The VA 
Funding Fee In order to defray the cost of admi nistering the VA Home  Loan program, each 
veteran must pay a funding fee to VA at loan closing.   Congress may periodically change the f unding fee rates to reflect changes in 
the cost of administering the program, or to assist a certain class of veterans.

evaluation fee of $50 in lieu of the charge for a credit report.    For “Refer” cases, the veteran ma y also pay the charge for a 
merged credit report, if required.  
Prepaid Items The veteran can pay that portion of taxes, assessments, and 
similar items for the current ye ar chargeable to the borrower

made by the lender or a VA appraiser. 
Survey The veteran can pay a charge  for a survey, if required by the 
lender or veteran.  Any charge for a survey in connection with a condominium loan must  have the prior approval of 
VA.

 Charge Description 
Title 
Examination and Title Insurance 
 The veteran may pay a fee for title examination and title 
insurance, if any.    If the lender decides that an  environmental protection lien 
endorsement to a title policy is needed, the cost of the 
endorsement may be charged to the veteran. 
Special Mailing Fees for Refinancing Loans For refinancing loans only, the veteran can pay charges for 
Federal Express, Express Mail, or a similar service when the saved per diem interest cost to the veteran will exceed the 
cost of the special handling. 
VA Funding Fee Unless exempt, each veteran must pay a funding fee to VA. 
Mortgage 
Electronic Registration System (MERS) Fee The veteran may pay a fee for MERS.  MERS is a one-time 
fee for the purpose of electroni cally tracking the ownership 
of the beneficial interest in a loan and its se rvicing rights. 
Other Fees 
Authorized by VA Additional fees attributable to local variances may be 
charged to the veteran only if specifically authorized by VA. 
The lender may submit a written request to the Regional 
Loan Center for approval if th e fee is normally paid by the 
borrower in a particular jurisdiction and considered 
reasonable and customary in the jurisdiction. 
 
Whenever the charge relates to serv ices performed by a third party, the 
amount paid by the borrower must be lim ited to the actual charge of that 
third party.    
Example :  If the lender obtains a cr edit report at a cost of $30, the 
lender may only charge the borrower $30 for the credit report.  The 
lender may not charge $35, even if it believes that a $5 handling 
charge is fair.

Fees and 
Charges 
(continued)  In addition, the borrower may not pay a duplicate fee for services that have 
already been paid for by another party.  Examples :   
• An appraisal is completed on a prope rty and paid for by a prospective 
purchaser, but the sale is never comp leted.  A second purchaser applies for 
a loan before the validity period of the Notice of Value (NOV) expires.  The 
lender uses the same NOV.  The lender may not charge the second 
purchaser an appraisal fee if no second appraisal is ordered.  
• A survey or flood zone determination, if  the lender elects to use an existing 
survey or flood determination. 
  
  
d.  Lender’s 
One Percent 
Flat Charge In addition to the “itemized fees an d charges,” the lender may charge the 
veteran a flat charge not to exceed one percent of the loan amount.   
 Calculate the one percent on the principa l amount after adding the funding fee 
to the loan, if the funding fee is paid fr om loan proceeds (e xcept Interest Rate 
Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRLs). 
 
Note :  For IRRRLs, use VA Form 26-8923 , IRRRL Worksheet, for the 
calculation.   
 The lender’s flat charge is intended to  cover all of the lender’s costs and 
services which are not reimbursable as “itemized fees and charges.”

e.  Construction 
Loans The lender can charge an additional flat  charge on constr uction, alteration, 
improvement, or repair loans.  If the lender supervises th e progress of construction and/or makes advances to 
a veteran in excess of 50 percent of the loan duri ng construction, alteration, 
improvement, or repair, then the lender may charge the veteran up to two percent of the loan amount in addition to the lender’s one percent flat charge.  
 
Example :  Total charges to the veteran in  these cases would be, at a   
maximum, itemized fees and charges plus  a three percent flat charge plus  
discount points. 
 
If the lender does not supervise the progr ess of construction or make advances 
to a veteran in excess of 50 percent of  the loan during c onstruction, alteration, 
improvement, or repair, then the lender may charge the veteran up to one percent of the loan amount in addition to  the lender’s one percent flat charge. 
 
Example :  Total charges to the veteran in these cases would be, at a 
maximum, itemized fees and charges pl us a two percent flat charge plus 
discount points. 
 This provision also applies to supplemental loans.

Change Date November 08, 2010, Change 15 
• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Lender’s 
Use of One Percent Flat Charge The lender’s maximum allowable flat ch arge of one percent of the loan 
amount (or greater percentage in the case of construction loans) is intended to 
cover all of the lender’s costs and servi ces which are not reimbursable as 
“itemized fees and charges.”  The lender may pay third parties for services or do as it wishes with the funds from th e flat charge, as long as the lender 
complies with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).    Section 2, subsections c and d, of this  chapter provide some examples of 
items that cannot  be charged to the veteran as “itemized fees and charges.”  
 This section provides more examples of items that cannot be paid by the veteran, but can be paid out of the lende r’s flat charge or by some party other 
than the veteran. 
  
b.  Attorney’s 
Fees The lender may not charge the borrower for attorney’s fees.  However, 
reasonable fees for title examination wo rk and title insurance can be paid by 
the borrower.  They are allowabl e itemized fees and charges.  
 VA does not intend to prevent the vete ran from seeking independent legal 
representation.  Therefore, the veteran can independently retain an attorney 
and pay a fee for legal services in co nnection with the purchase of a home.  
Closing documents should clearly indi cate that the attorney’s fee is not being 
charged by the lender, but is being pa id by the veteran as part of an 
independent arrangement with an attorney.

c.  Brokerage 
Fees Fees or commissions charged by a real estate agent or br oker in connection 
with a VA loan may not be charged to or paid by  the veteran-purchaser.   
 While use of “buyer” brokers is no t precluded, veteran-purchasers may not, 
under any circumstances, be charged a brokerage fee or commission in 
connection with the services of such  individuals.  Since information on 
property available for purchase and fina ncing options is widely available to 
the public from a variety of sources, VA does not believe that preventing the 
veteran from paying buyer-broker fees will harm the veteran. 
  
d.  Prepayment 
Penalties A veteran obtaining a VA refinancing loan cannot  use loan proceeds to pay 
penalty costs for prepayme nt of an existing lien. 
 A veteran purchasing a property with a VA loan cannot  pay penalty costs 
required to discharge any existi ng liens on the seller’s property. 
  
e.  HUD / FHA 
Inspection Fees for Builders In proposed construction cases in whic h the dwelling was constructed under 
the Department of Housing and Urba n Development (HUD) supervision, the 
cost of any inspections or re-inspect ions must be borne by the builder or 
sponsor and are not chargeable to the veteran- purchaser.  This includes: 
 
• re-inspections by VA or HUD of onsite or offsite work for which an escrow 
agreement was established, and 
• any additional re-inspections deemed necessary by VA to assure conformity 
with VA regulations.

a.  Policy The seller, lender, or any other party may pay fees and charges, including 
discount points, on behalf of the borrower.  VA regulations limit charges “made agains t or paid by” the borrower.  They 
do not limit the payment of fees and charges by other parties. 
  
b.  Exception Excessive seller conces sions are prohibited.

5. Seller Concessions 
  
Change Date November 08, 2010, Change 15 
• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Definition For the purposes of this topic, a selle r concession is anything of value added 
to the transaction by the builder or seller for which the buyer pays nothing 
additional and which the seller is not customarily expected or required to pay 
or provide.   
  
b.  Seller 
Concessions Seller concessions include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
• payment of the buyer’s VA funding fee 
• prepayment of the buyer’s property taxes and insurance 
• gifts such as a television set or microwave oven 
• payment of extra points to provide  permanent interest rate buydowns 
• provision of escrowed funds to provi de temporary interest rate buydowns, 
and 
• payoff of credit balances or judgments on behalf of the buyer. 
 Seller concessions do not include payment of the buyer’s closing costs, or 
payment of points as appr opriate to the market. 
 Example :  If the market dictates an inte rest rate of 7½ percent with two 
discount points, the seller’s payment of the two points would  not be a seller 
concession.  If the seller paid five poi nts, three of these points would be 
considered a seller concession.  
  
c.  The Problem In some localities, builders or sellers offer concessions as a competitive tool.  
In extreme cases, the concessions may entice unwary and unq ualified veterans 
into home mortgages they cannot affor d.  The concessions may disguise the 
veteran’s inability to qualify for the loan.

d.  The Four 
Percent Limit Any seller concession or combination of concessions which exceeds four 
percent of the established reasonable value of the property is considered 
excessive, and unacceptable for VA-guaranteed loans.    Do not include normal discount points and payment of the buyer’s closing 
costs in total concessions for determining whether concessions exceed the four percent limit.

a.  Itemized 
Fees and Charges The borrower’s out-of-pocket expenses for itemized fees and charges already

b.  The One 
Percent Flat 
Fee If the lender has already co llected the one percent flat fee from the borrower, 
the lender must refund the fee.  This applies to a loan that does not close for 
any reason, including the borrowe r going to another lender.

fee structure is extended through Sept ember 30, 2017, as a result of the law 
noted above.   
• This section has been updated to  make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  The 
Lender’s Role The lender must: 
 
• verify the status of any veteran who may be exempt from paying the 
funding fee; 
• determine the amount of  funding fee owed by any non-exempt borrower; 
• collect the appropriate fee from all non- exempt borrowers at loan closing; 
• electronically remit the funds to VA in a timely manner through the VA 
Funding Fee Payment System (FFPS);  
• print proof of payment of the funding fee; and 
• submit proof that the funding fee has been paid or that the veteran is exempt 
from paying the funding fee to VA w ith the closed loan package. 
 
Note :  The funding fee may be paid from loan proceeds or cash from 
borrower. 
  
b.  Who is 
Exempt from 
Paying The Funding Fee? The following persons are exempt from paying the funding fee: 
• Veterans receiving VA compensation fo r service-connected disabilities. 
• Veterans who would be entitled to  receive compensation for service-
connected disabilities if they did not receive re tirement pay. 
• Veterans who are rated by VA as eligible  to receive compensation as a 
result of pre-discharge disability exam ination and rating or on the basis of a 
pre-discharge review of existing me dical evidence (including service 
medical and treatment records) that results in issuance of a memorandum 
rating. 
• Veterans entitled to receive compen sation, but who are not presently in 
receipt because they are on active duty.  
• Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-
connected disabilities (whether or not  such surviving spouses are veterans 
with their own entitlement and whethe r or not they ar e using their own 
entitlement on the loan).

8.  The VA Funding Fee, Continued 
  
c.  How to 
Verify Exempt Status The lender must verify exempt stat us by obtaining one of the following: 
 
• a properly completed and signed VA Form 26-8937 , Verification of VA 
Benefits, indicating the borrower’s exempt status, 
• for a veteran who elected servic e retirement pay instead of VA 
compensation, a copy of the original VA notification of disability rating and 
documentation of the veteran’s service retirement income, or  
• indications on the Certifi cate of Eligibility (COE) that the borrower is 
entitled as an unmarried surviving spouse. 
 Consult VA if the borrower’s status is unclear after reviewing the appropriate 
documents, or if conflicting information is found. 
  
d.  Loan 
Submissions Involving Exempt Borrowers Submit a copy of the documentation used to verify exempt status with the 
closing package.    Exception :  The lender does not have to submit the documentation if the 
borrower is an eligible surviving sp ouse, or the documentation had been 
previously provided to VA with the loan  application as verification of the 
veteran’s income. 
 
Note :  A lender who believes that a servicemember may be exempt from 
payment of the funding fee based on a pr e-discharge exam should contact the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of juri sdiction for assistance confirming the 
exempt status.

e.  If Exempt 
Status Cannot 
Be Determined If the veteran’s exempt status cannot be  verified prior to loan closing, the 
funding fee must  be remitted as if the borrower was not exempt.   
 Indicate in the closing package that the veteran claims exempt status.  VA 
will determine the borrower’s status and refund the funding fee if appropriate.  
 If the veteran has a pending disability compensation claim at the time of loan 
closing, the funding fee must be re mitted as if the borrower was not exempt. 
 Advise the veteran to contact the VA RL C to request a refund if it is later 
determined that the veteran is entitled to compensation retroactively to a date prior to loan closing.  
 
Reference :  Refer to subsection j, “Refunding Overpayments to the Veteran,” 
in this section. 
  
f.  How to 
Calculate the 
Funding Fee For all loans except IRRRLs, apply th e appropriate percentage (from the 
funding fee tables) to the loan amount.    If the funding fee is to be paid from lo an proceeds, apply the percentage to the 
loan amount without the funding fee amount added to it.   
 
For IRRRLs, calculate th e funding fee by completing VA Form 26-8923 , 
IRRRL Worksheet. 
 Reference :  For joint loans, see “Calculati on of the Funding Fee” in section 1 
of chapter 7 .

g.  How to Use 
the Funding Fee Tables The lender must find the appropriate pe rcentage in the tables using the 
following parameters:  
• Is the veteran eligible for VA loan benefits through service in the regular 
military or the Reserves/National Guard?  Examine the COE.  For 
Reserves/National Guard, the COE bears the notation, 
“RESERVES/NATIONAL GUARD - INCREASED FUNDING FEE,” and 
is buff-colored rather than green. 
• Is the veteran a subsequent user of VA home loan benefits or obtaining his 
or her first VA loan?  Examine the CO E.  An entitlement code of “5” 
indicates subsequent use, as does a loan number entered in the “Loan 
Number” column.  
• What type of loan is the vetera n obtaining?  The funding fee varies 
depending upon whether the loan is a purchase or construction loan, an 
IRRRL, or a cash-out refinancing loan. 
• Is the veteran making a downpayment of at least five or ten percent? 
− Calculate what percentage of the sale s price of the property the veteran is 
remitting as a downpayment. 
− The downpayment may come from th e veteran’s own resources or 
borrowed funds.  Except,  if the purchase price exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property, the difference between the purchase price and the 
reasonable value must be paid by the veteran in cash without borrowing. 
• For construction loans only, equity in the secured property counts as a 
downpayment for calculating the funding fee.

i.  How and 
When to Remit the Funding Fee to VA Lenders must remit the VA funding fee via the VA FFPS ; within 15 calendar 
days of loan closing.   
 Lenders paying the fee more than 15 days after loan closing will automatically be assessed a four percen t late fee.  Fees paid more than 30 
days late will automatically be assessed an interest charge in addition to the late fee. 
  
j.  Refunding 
Overpayments to the Veteran A refund is appropriate if: 
 
• an exempt veteran paid a funding fee, or 
• a miscalculation of the fee caused an overpayment. 
 Using the VA FFPS , lenders can make appropriate corrections that may result 
in refunds being due.   
 If the veteran was overcharg ed, the following applies: 
 
• A veteran who paid cash for the fundi ng fee receives a cash refund for the 
amount of the overpayment. 
• In the case of a veteran who paid th e funding fee out of loan proceeds, the 
lender must apply the overpayment ag ainst the loan balance.  Submit 
evidence to VA that the refund was applie d to the loan’s principal balance.

9-2 1.  Security Instruments  
   
Change Date July 30, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. 
Requirements Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not have a specific note or 
mortgage form that lenders must  use for VA-guaranteed loans. VA 
regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4337  provide that security  instruments used by a 
lender which are inconsistent with VA regulations in effect on the date the 
loan is closed will be considered am ended and supplemented to conform to 
the regulations.  
Lenders must ensure that the se curity instruments they use: 
 
 establish the required lien 
 comply with the laws and regul ations governing VA’s home loan 
program 
 comply with applicable state laws, and 
 contain the following VA clauses: 
o assumption approval clause, 
o acceleration clause, 
o funding fee clause, 
o processing charge clause, and 
o indemnity liability assumption clause.  
 
   
b. Assumption 
Approval 
Clause The instruments evidencing the loan must read substantially as follows: 
 “THIS LOAN IS NOT ASSUMAB LE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF 
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR ITS AUTHORIZED 
AGENT.”  The loan assumption notice must appear conspicuously on at least one of the securit
y instruments for the loan.

 1.  Security Instruments, continued 
  
c. Other 
Clauses The mortgage or deed of trust must c ontain four additional clauses related to 
the assumption of the loan.  VA does not specifically require that these 
clauses also be included in the note, unl ess this is required under state law to 
make them enforceable. Due to varia tions in local laws, the lender should 
obtain legal guidance as to any minor ch anges in these sample clauses which 
may be necessary to ensure that they have the effect required by the law and 
regulations; that is, th e lender does not have to  use the exact language 
provided for these four clauses.  
Acceleration Clause 
This loan may be declared immediately  due and payable upon transfer of the 
property securing such loan to any tran sferee, unless the acceptability of the 
assumption of the loan is established pursuant to 38 U.SC. 3714 . 
 
Funding Fee Clause 
A fee equal to one-half of one percent of th e balance of this loan as of the date 
of transfer of the property shall be paya ble at the time of transfer to the loan 
holder or its authorized agent, as trust ee for the VA. If the assumer fails to pay 
this fee at the time of transf er, the fee shall constitute an additional debt to that 
already secured by this instrument, sha ll bear interest at the rate herein 
provided, and at the option of the payee of the indebtedness hereby secured or 
any transferee thereof, shall be immedia tely due and payable.  This fee is 
automatically waived if the assumer is exempt under the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 3729(c) . 
 
Processing Charge Clause   
Upon application for approva l to allow assumption of this loan, a processing 
fee may be charged by the loan holder or  its authorized agent for determining 
the creditworthiness of the assumer a nd subsequently revising the holder’s 
ownership records when an approved tr ansfer is completed. The amount of 
this charge shall not exceed the maximum established by VA for a loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714  applies. 
 Indemnity Liability Assumption Clause 
If this obligation is assumed, then the assumer hereby agrees to assume all of 
the obligations of the Veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and 
securing the loan. The assumer further ag rees to indemnify VA to the extent 
of any claim payment arising from the guaranty or insurance of the 
indebtedness created by this instrument.

9-4 2. Escape Clause and No tice of Value (NOV)  
 
Change Date July 30, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. Sales 
Contract The Escape Clause must be containe d in the sales contract for all VA-
guaranteed loans.   The lender is respons ible for ensuring that the paragraph is 
in the sales contract prior to  closing.  In the event the clause is not in the sales 
contract, VA ma y not guarant y the loan. 
 
b. Builders and 
Realtors The builders/realtors that initiate contracts on new construction must ensure 
that the Escape Clause is in the cont ract and the contract is signed by the 
Veteran and seller. 
 
c. Upgrades Upgrades are not considered earnest m oney and the builder is not required to 
refund this money.  When the NOV is be low the sales contra ct price, this 
clause protects the Veteran with ne gotiation of the sales contract. 
 
d. Escape 
Clause If the sales contract was signed by the Veteran prior to receipt of the NOV, 
the contract must include, or be am ended to include, the clause below. 
 “It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any ot her provisions of this 
contract, the purchaser shall not incu r any penalty by forfeiture of earnest 
money or otherwise or be obligated to complete the purchase of the property 
described herein, if the c ontract purchase price or cost exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property established by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The 
purchaser shall, however, have the priv ilege and option of proceeding with the 
consummation of this contract without re gard to the amount of the reasonable 
value established by the Depar tment of Veterans Affairs ( 38 U.S.C. 501, 
3703(c)(1) ).”   
 
This clause may be found at 38 C.F.R. 36.4303(k)(4)  in its entirety.

 3.  Title Limitations 
  
Change Date July 30, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. Estate of the 
Veteran in the 
Property VA regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4354  provide the parameters  for the required 
estate of a Veteran in real pr operty securing a VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
The lender is responsible for ensuring th e loan conforms to these parameters.  
For IRRRLs (see Chapter 6, Topic 6, Item k of this handbook). 
 
A beneficial interest in a revocable Fa mily Living Trust that ensures that the 
Veteran, or Veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the 
lien attaches to any remainder interest and the tr ust arrangement is valid under 
state law. 
  
b. Estate Title  Generally, title to the estate shall be  that which is acceptable to informed 
buyers, title companies, and attorneys in the community in which the 
propert y is situated. 
  
c. Mortgage 
Note or Deed  VA does not allow an individual to take title  to a property if th at individual is  
not on either the mortgage note or a mortga ge deed of trust.  Accordingly, if  
a spouse or other owner does not want to sign a mortgage note and be  
obligated for a VA-guaranteed home lo an that individual must sign a  
mort gage deed of trust. 
  
d.  Title 
Insurance VA does not require a lender making a VA loan or the Veteran-borrower to  
obtain title insurance.  The lende r may apply its own title insurance 
requirements to VA loan transactions.  VA requires only that title to the  
property meet the standards described above in “Estate of the Veteran in the 
Propert y.”

e. Restrictions 
on the Purchase 
or Resale of 
Properties Restrictions on the purchase or resale of the property ar e unacceptable to 
VA, with certain exceptions.  The lender must:  
 ensure any restrictions fall with in the exceptions provided by VA 
regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4308  and 38 C.F.R. 36.4354 ; 
 consult VA where doubt exists; 
 obtain VA approval where required; and 
 fully inform the Veteran and obt ain his or her consent to the 
restrictions in writing at th e time of loan application. 
 
 
f. Examples of 
Restrictions that Require VA 
Approval A lender may not accelerate a loan base d on the sale of the secured property 
unless the acceptability of the assu mption of the loan has not been 
established pursuant to Section 38 U.S.C. 3714 , except 
that:  
 Under 38 C.F.R. 36.4309(b), VA may guarantee a loan made through 
a state, territorial, or local governme nt program where restrictions in 
the legal instruments require acceleration of the loan if it is assumed 
by a party ineligible for a ssistance under the program. 
 Such acceleration must be mandated by federal, state, territorial, or 
local law or regulation. 
 VA may guarantee a loan made  through a state or lo cal government program, 
designed to assist low-or moderate -income individuals, which imposes 
resale and price restrictions on purchas ers.  Under such a program, if the 
property is resold within a period es tablished by local law or ordinance, 
certain restrictions as set forth in 38 C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5)(iv)(A)  on to whom 
the property may be sold, the resale pri ce, and other restrictions approved by 
the Secretary may be applied.  
VA may guarantee a loan on which a title re striction limits the sale, lease, or 
occupancy of the dwelling to persons based on age, incl uding a prohibition 
against the permanent occupancy of the dwelling by children, provided such 
restriction complies with applicable federal law ( 38 U.S.C. 3704(c) ).   
 
VA may refuse to approve a property with  an age restricti on if its operation 
would create an undue hardship upon th e owner in the case of sudden, 
unforeseen events or be likely to result in an increased risk  of loan default.

 3.  Title Limitations,  continued 
   
g. Examples of 
Restrictions That Do Not 
Require VA 
Approval Title to property involving reasonable encroachments, easements, servitudes, 
and reservations for water, timber, or  subsurface rights, generally do not 
require VA approval.  However, they mu st be taken into consideration in 
determining reasonable value.    If any of these restrictions impact the basic livability of the property (meeting 
minimum propert
y standards), VA approval is required. 
  
h. Effect of 
Title 
Limitations on Reasonable 
Value Title conditions or limi tations must be shown on the NOV and considered by 
the appraiser in determining the reasona ble value of the property.  If the 
lender discovers, prior to loan closin g, title conditions or limitations not 
shown on the NOV, the lender must ha ve VA review the conditions and 
determine whether the value assigned to the property is materially affected.  Without such a determination by VA, th e lender risks a later finding that the 
condition or limitation affects the reasona ble value of the property to the 
extent that: 
 
 the loan will be ineligible for guaranty, or 
 a claim on the guaranty will be subject to reduction under 38 C.F.R. 
36.4325 .

9-8 4. Land Sale Contract s and Option Contracts 
  
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. Eligibility of 
Land Sale Contracts VA may guarantee an obligation secured by a land sale contract for the 
purchase of improved residential prop erty in the same manner as any 
obligation secured by a mortga ge or deed of trust.  
 
 The land sale contract must contai n the mandatory clauses provided in 
Topic 1 of this chapter. 
 The contract must be recorded. 
 
  
b. Refinance 
Land Sale 
Contracts Pursuant to Title 38 of the U.S.C., subchapter 3710(b)(7)(B) , VA may also 
guarantee a loan to refinance the unpaid balance under a land sale contract for 
the purchase of improved resi dential property, provided: 
 
 the Veteran will obtain title to the pr operty described in the contract 
upon closing of the loan, and 
 the obligation to be guaranteed is in the form of a mortgage note or 
bond secured by a mortgage or other acceptable form of security instrument other than the existin
g land sale contract. 
 
c. Eligibility of 
Option 
Contracts Option contracts are not eligible for guaranty; however, VA may guarantee a 
loan made for the unpaid purchase pri ce of residential property when the 
option is exercised.

 5.  Secondary Borrowing 
    
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. What is 
Secondary 
Borrowing  For purposes of this topic, secondary  borrowing refers to the Veteran  
obtaining a second mortgage simultane ously with a VA-guaranteed first 
mortgage, both secured by the same property.  This does not include HAPs 
(see Topic 9, Item 13 of this chapter). 
     
b. Policy Secondary borrowing is acceptable as long as: 
 
 the Veteran is not placed in a subs tantially worse position than if the 
entire amount borrowed had been guaranteed by VA, 
 the loan (in conjunction with the fi rst mortgage) may not exceed the 
NOV, and 
 the requirements detailed below are met. 
 
c.  
Requirements The second mortgage must meet  the following requirements: 
 
Factor  Requirement  
Documentation The lender must submit documentation disclosing the 
source, amount, and repayment terms of the second mortgage and agreement to such terms by the Veteran and any co-borrowers. 
Lien Position The second mortgage must be subordinated to the 
VA-guaranteed loan, that is, the second mortgage must be in a junior lien position relative to the VA 
loan. 
Allowable 
Purposes Proceeds of the second mortgage may be used for a 
variety of purposes, in cluding, but not limited to: 
 closing costs, or 
 a downpayment to meet secondary market 
requirement of the lender. 
But may not be used to cover any portion of a 
downpayment required by VA to cover the excess of the purchase price over VA’s reasonable value.

c. 
Requirements, 
continued  Factor  Requirement  
Cash back There can be no cash back to the Veteran from the 
VA first mortgage or a sec ond mortgage obtained    
simultaneously, except any cash the Veteran paid 
in the transaction. 
Underwriting The Veteran must qualify for the second mortgage 
which is underwritten as an additional recurring 
monthl y obligation.  
Interest 
Rate The rate on the second mortgage may exceed the 
rate on the VA-guaranteed first; however, it may not exceed industry standards for second mortgages. 
Assumability The second mortgage s hould not restrict the 
Veteran’s ability to sell the property any more than the VA first mortgage. Th at is, it should be 
assumable by creditworthy purchaser(s). 
Grace Period There should be a r easonable grace period before. A 
late charge comes due, or commencement of 
foreclosure proceedings in the event of default. 
 
     
d. Unusual 
Terms Second mortgages bearing unusual terms, interest rates, et c., are sometimes 
offered by parties such as: 
 
 federal, state, or loca l government agencies, 
 non-profit organizations, 
 private individual, 
 builders, or 
 sellers. 
  
e. VA 
Standards Consult a VA RLC with jurisdiction ove r the state where the property is 
located if it is unclear whether the terms of the second mortgage meet VA 
standards or if there may be a reason able basis for VA to make an exception 
to the standards detailed in this topic.

 6.  Purchase of Property with Encumbrances 
  
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. Policy 
 Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3703(d)(3)(A) , a VA-guaranteed loan must be 
secured by a first lien on the realty.  Lenders are responsible for properly 
securing the first-lien position of a VA- guaranteed loan.  Any existing liens 
on the propert y must be paid off or s ubordinated to the VA loan. 
  
b. Eligibility A loan to purchase property subject to unpaid delinquent taxes, special 
assessments, prior mortgage indebted ness, or other obligations secured by 
effective liens that the Veteran ag rees to pay or which constitute 
encumbrances on the property is not elig ible for guaranty, if  the loan amount, 
plus these unpaid obli gations, exceeds VA’s reasonable value of the propert y.

9-12 7.  Liens Covering Community-T ype Services and Facilities  
 
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. Policy Loans for the purchase and construction of homes will be first liens, subject 
only to taxes, special assessments, and ground rents.  VA will not approve superior liens in favor of private entities unless they: 
 
 are legally or practically necessary, and 
 result in no prejudice to the Veterans or the Government. 
  
b. 
Requirements The lender must obtain VA prior approva l of liens held by private parties 
which are superior to VA home mortga ge liens.  Liens held by mandatory 
membership home associations in planned unit developments are not addressed in this topic.  The lender must demonstrate that: 
 
 it is not legal or practical to subor dinate the superior lien to the VA 
mortgage, 
 there is a viable rati onale for not subordinat ing the superior lien, 
 the superior lien will not prejudice Veterans or  the Government, and 
 if periodic charges or assessmen ts are involved, the amounts are 
reasonable and limits on the amoun ts have been established. 
 
  
c. VA Approval Always obtain VA approval before th e lien is recorded. Builders and 
developers should be aware that if they  plan to market properties through VA 
financing, covenants creating superior lie ns should not be recorded without  
VA approval.

d. Examples  VA may find the following types of superior liens acceptable ( 38 C.F.R. 
36.4356):  
 
 Liens for taxes, assessme nts, and ground rents. 
 Liens by private entities to secu re assessments or charges for 
municipal- type services  and facilities which: 
o are clearly governmental in nature, and  
o a municipality could support out of public tax revenue if it 
provided the service, but the municipality does not provide them. 
 Liens to implement or augment a service or facility if the 
government’s provision of such serv ice or facility is inadequate. 
 Liens for services or facilities in  locations where the services or 
facilities are adequately supplied by local government generally will 
not be approved by VA. 
 Liens created by recorded covenants in favor of private entities to 
secure the homeowner’s share of  the costs of the management, 
operation, maintenance, services, or  programs for th e benefit of a 
development. 
 Liens (on existing properties) pr eviously retained by trustees, 
improvement associations or ot her nongovernmental  entities for 
community-type services and facilities  in a given area or subdivision, 
such as maintenance of streets, parkways, playgrounds, water systems, 
sewa
ge systems, police and fire protection, or street li ghting.

9-14 8.  Power of Attorney (POA) 
   
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. Policy VA will allow a Veteran to use an attorney-in-fact to execute any documents 
necessary to obtain a VA-guaranteed loan.  This enables active duty servicepersons stationed overseas, and other Veterans  who cannot be present 
to execute loan documents, to obtain VA loans. 
 
b. 
Requirements The Veteran must execute a general or specific POA which is valid and 
legally adequate.  The Veteran’s attorney-in-fact (as specified in the POA) must use this POA to apply for a Certif icate of Eligibility (COE) and initiate 
processing of a loan on behalf of the Ve teran.  A military POA is considered a 
general POA and is only valid durin g the Active Duty Servicemembers’ 
(ADSM) period of deployme nt, not to exceed 1 year. 
 To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, ensure that the general or specific POA complies with state law to the extent that: 
 
 the mortgage can be legally enforced in that jurisdiction, and 
 clear title can be conveyed in  the event of foreclosure. 
 
To complete the loan transaction usi ng an attorney-in-fact, VA also requires 
the Veteran’s written consen t to the specifics of the transaction either through 
a general POA or a specific POA. 
 
General POA - The Veteran’s signature  on both the sales contract and the 
Uniform Residential Loan Application, as  long as the Veteran’s intention to 
obtain a VA loan on the particular prope rty is expressed somewhere in those 
documents.

b. 
Requirements, 
continued  
  
Specific POA.  A specific power of a ttorney or other document(s) signed by 
the Veteran, which encompasses the elements below.  
 Entitlement: A clear intention to use all or a specified amount of 
entitlement. 
 Purpose: A clear intention to  obtain a loan for purchase, 
construction, repair, alteration, improvement, or refinance. 
 Property Identification: Identification of the specific property. 
 Price and Terms: The sales price, if applicable, and other relevant 
terms of the transaction. 
 Occupancy: The Veteran’s intention to use the property as a home to 
be occupied by the Veteran (or other applicable VA occupancy 
requirement or spouse and/or 
guardian for dependen t child(ren)).  
 
c.  Veteran’s 
Status as Alive 
and not MIA The lender must always verify that the Veteran is alive at the time of loan 
closing, whether or not the Veteran is an ADSM in the military. If on active 
military duty, the Veteran must no t be missing in action (MIA). 
 
The lender must make the following certi fication at the time of loan closing: 
 “The undersigned lender certifies that written evidence in the form of 
correspondence from the Veteran or, if on active military duty, statement of 
his or her commanding officer (includi ng statement of person authorized to 
act for said officer), affirmatively indicating that the Veteran was alive 
and, if the Veteran is on active military  duty, not missing in action status 
on (date), was examined by the undersigne d and that the said date is on or 
subsequent (not prior) to the date the note and security instruments were 
executed on the Veteran’s behalf by the attorney-in-fact .” 
 
VA may deny guaranty on a loan if the lender failed to properly verify the 
Veteran’s status and the Veteran was d eceased (or MIA) at the time the loan 
was closed. 
             
d.  Digital 
Signature Digital signatures can be accepted as an  original signature or wet signature 
as defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 
Act, commonl y referred to as the E-si gn Act.

e. Prior 
Approval Loans VA will issue a Certificate of Commitment only if the Veteran has executed 
a valid and legally adequate POA and c onsented to the specific transaction 
(as described under the “Requirement” h eading).  If VA has information that 
the Veteran is MIA or deceased, VA will not issue a commitment.  The 
Certificate of Commitment issued in  POA cases contains the condition 
indicated under “Conditiona l Commitments” in Topic 5.04e of Chapter 5 in 
the Lende r’s Handbook. 
   
f. Hardship 
Exceptions VA may consider an exceptional case if serious hardship may result due to 
the time or other pertinent factors involved in obtaining the Veteran’s consent to the specific transaction.  Submit the facts of the case to the VA RLC where 
the propert
y is located for a determination.

 9.  Lender Review of Sales Contracts on Proposed 
Construction 
    
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. Procedures Prior to requesting an ap praisal of proposed cons truction, the lender must 
review the sales contract or purchase agreement on the property.  The lender 
must determine whether the contract:  
 is acceptable, and 
 
does not contain unfair contractual provisions.  
   
b. Revisions The lender must request revisions of an unacceptable contract by the parties 
to the transaction.  The lender should report unacceptable contract practices 
by a VA program participant (s uch as a builder) to VA if: 
 
 the program participant is engage d in practices which seriously 
prejudice the interests of Vete rans or the Government, or 
 the program participant repeatedly  uses unacceptable contracts or 
contracts containing unfair co ntractual provisions, and is 
uncooperative in chan ging such practices  
  
c. Closing The closing of the loan indicates that th e lender has determined the contract is 
acceptable.  
  
d. Examples of 
Unfair 
Contract 
Provisions or Features Example  Unfair Contract Provisions or Features  
1 Provisions allowing the downpayment or earnest money of the 
purchaser to be forfeited or retained as liquidated damages if the purchaser cannot obtain VA financing. 
2 Inclusion in a lump-sum  contract of an “escalator clause” which 
obligates the purchaser to pay a higher price in the event of 
increased costs for labor, material, or other items prior to delivery 
of title unless accompanied by a proviso which gives the purchaser the option of canceli ng the contract and obtaining a 
refund of the moneys paid, if th e increased price is not acceptable 
to the buyer/Veteran.

d. Examples of 
Unfair Contract 
Provisions or Features, 
continued 
 3 Provisions which infringe upon the usual or customary freedom or 
right of an owner to sell a property, except as allowed under 38 
C.F.R. 36.4308(e)  and 36.4354(b)(5) . For example, a provision that 
the purchaser will give a stated real estate agency an exclusive 
listing if he or she resells th e property within 2 years after 
acquisition, or will give the seller or another a first option to buy 
other than in a cooperative housi ng project or as provided in 38 
C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5) . 
4 A requirement that purchasers waiv e or release any claim or right 
for nonperformance by the builder under the contract. 
 
This does not prevent a builder  from obtaining a statement from 
the purchaser at closing that he or she has inspected the house and 
has not observed any unsatisfact ory construction, nor does it 
prevent the builder from obtaining a release from the purchaser in 
settlement of a bona fide dispute. 
5 Omission of an accurate property description. 
6 Omission of a provision specifying whether the builder or the 
Veteran is to be charged with  any special assessments or 
improvement bonds. This include s those assessments or bonds 
which are payable in the future, for improvements included in the 
plans and specifications or commenced  or completed at  the time of

 10.  Escrow for Postponed Co mpletion of Improvements 
   
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. General In some instances, it may not be possibl e to complete certain items before the 
Veteran wishes to move into the propert y.  The escrow of funds can permit the 
Veteran-purchaser to gain occupancy of  the dwelling prior to completion of 
certain items which must be postponed due to weather conditions or other 
circumstances.  Such items include, but are not limited to:  
 walkways, driveways, and retaining walls, 
 exterior painting, 
 landscaping, and 
 garages. 
   
b. Escrow of 
Funds to 
Complete Unfinished 
Work VA may permit the escrow of funds n ecessary to complete the unfinished 
work later, and still issue evidence of guaranty.  An escrow involves the 
following: 
 
 withholding 1 1/2 times the dollar am ount necessary to complete the 
postponed items (as estimated by a th ird party) from the proceeds due 
the seller at closing, 
 holding the escrowing funds in a proper, secure manner, and 
 releasing the funds once the postponed items have been satisfactorily 
completed. 
  
c. Establishing 
an Escrow 
Fund To establish an escrow, the following must apply: 
 
 construction of the dwelling must be  complete and the house must be 
suitable for immedi ate occupancy, 
 postponement of the improvements mu st be beyond the control of the 
builder/seller, 
 the duration of the postp onement must not be un reasonable (usually 90 
to 120 days), and 
 the amount escrowed must be at leas t 1 1/2 times an estimate of the 
amount needed to complete the work.

 Lenders are not required to escrow funds when: 
 
 the incomplete work is limited to the installation of landscaping 
features due to inclement weat her (lawns, shrubbery, etc.), 
 the estimate of the cost to comple te the work is not greater than 
$2,500, and 
 there is adequate assurance that th e work will be completed timely and 
satisfactoril y (usuall y 90 to 120 da ys). 
  
d. General 
Procedures No prior approval of VA is required  to escrow funds.  Lenders are 
responsible for establishing escrows in accordance with the guidelines 
presented in this topic.  Lenders are also responsible fo r assuring that the 
postponed work is completed.  Once the loan closes, VA will randomly 
monitor cases to ensure co mpletion of escrowed items. 
 
Step  Action  
1 Close loan and escr ow the required funds. 
2 Upload the closed loan packag e into WebLGY for issuance of 
guaranty with: 
 
 lender evidence of an escrow agreement, or 
 a completed VA Form 26-1849 , Escrow 
    Agreement for Post poned Exterior Onsite 
    Improvements . 
3 Release escrowed funds when work is satisfactorily completed, 
as evidenced by doing the following: 
 
 Complete VA Form 26-1839 , Compliance Inspection  
    Report , indicating the postponed work has been  
    satisfactorily completed, or 
 if the postponed work is minor, uncomplicated, and not 
    involving structural issues , provide written certification    
    from the lender indicating the work has been completed,  
    and a statement from the Veteran-purchaser that he or      she is satisfied with the work.

e. Letter of 
Credit A commercial letter of credit may be used  in lieu of a cash escrow provided: 
 
 the dollar amount of available cred it is at least 1 1/2 times the 
    estimated cost of the postponed work, 
 a trust agreement describing the duties, obligations, and 
    responsibilities is submitted ( VA Form 26-1849  may be used), 
 the letter of credit is irrevocable and a valid and binding obligation on 
    the issuing bank and extends at least 6 months beyond the date for    
    completion of improvements, and

9-22 11.  Hazard Insurance 
  
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. General 
Requirements The lender is responsible for ensuring th at hazard insurance is obtained prior 
to loan closing, and maintained for the te rm of the loan.  It must be of an 
insurance type or types and in an am ount sufficient to protect the property 
against risks or hazards to which it may be subjected in the locality.  Generally, the type(s) and amount of in surance coverage customary in the 
locality will satisfy this requirement.  Policies must provide that all amounts 
payable, including unearned pr emiums, shall be payable to the holder, or to a 
trustee or other person for the holder.   All policy paymen ts received for 
insured losses must be applied to the rest oration of the security or to the loan 
balance. 
 
b. Flood 
Insurance 
Requirements The lender is responsible for ensuring  that flood insurance is obtained and 
maintained on any building or personal property that secure s a VA loan if the 
property is located in a special flood hazard area (SFHA), as identified by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The following flood insurance considerations may apply:  
 The lender/holder’s responsibility ex tends through the entire term of 
the loan, and includes insuring any secured property that becomes 
newly located in a SFHA due to FEMA remapping. 
 
 The VA appraiser’s opinion on whethe r the property is located in a 
SFHA does not relieve the lender from responsibility  for ensuring 
flood insurance coverage on a property which is in fact located in a 
SFHA.  
 Personal property requiring covera ge can include a manufactured 
home and its appliances, carpet, et c. if they secure the loan.

 11.  Hazard Insurance , continued 
  
b. Flood 
Insurance 
Requirements, 
continued   The amount of flood insurance must be equal to th e lesser of the 
outstanding principal balance of th e loan or the maximum limit of 
coverage available for the partic ular type(s) of property under the 
National Flood Insurance Act.  
 Contact local property insurance agen ts or brokers, or FEMA regional 
offices, for current informati on on maximum available coverage. 
 
Note:  VA cannot guarantee a loan if the security is located in a SFHA and 
flood insurance is not available.  
  
c. 
Consequences 
of Uninsured 
Losses VA may reduce a future guaranty cla im based on the lender’s noncompliance 
with VA hazard/flood insurance require ments which results in uninsured 
losses (unless a waiver has been gran ted).  The lender must determine the 
minimum insurance coverage needed  to meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. 
36.4329  for a specific loan.  If the required amount of coverage is maintained, 
no future guaranty claim can be reduced due to inadequate coverage provided there has been no change in the nature, value, or use of the security that 
would require new or additional coverage  (based on what is customary in the 
locality) since VA’s determination was made.

d. Special 
Considerations 
with 
Homeowners Associations
 Condominiums and many townhouse homeowners associations (HOAs) 
maintain blanket or master polic ies on common areas, including common 
mechanical and structural elements.  The limits of coverage should be 
described in the policy, and may also be referred to in the organizational 
documents.  Lenders should be aware that policies maintained by some HOAs 
may not provide adequate coverage.    Condominium HOAs may protect only the shel l of the structure. These “studs 
out” policies do not cover: 
 
 interior walls, 
 flooring, 
 plumbing or electrical fixtures, 
 cabinets, 
 heating, ventilation, and air c onditioning (HVAC) equipment, 
 appliances, and 
 other items considered part  of the real property. 
 
Carefully review the terms of each blanket policy, or confirm with the HOA 
that adequate coverage is in effect (and check periodically for any changes in 
coverage).  If coverage is inadequate , the homeowner can be held responsible 
through the terms of the loan instrume nts, for maintaining coverage on the 
portions of the real propert
y not covered b y the master polic y.

Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. 
Requirements VA does not require the lender to estab lish escrow accounts for the collection 
and payment of property taxes, hazard insurance premiums, and similar items. 
It is the lender’s responsibility to ensure that property taxes and hazard 
insurance premiums are paid timely.  
A lender who chooses to escrow for ta xes and insurance must comply with 
applicable laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).

9-26 13.  Homebuyer Assistance Program (HAP) 
   
Change Date July 30, 2019 
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
   
a. General 
Information VA permits Veteran purchasers to utiliz e HAP services when obtaining a VA 
home loan. Both government and pr ivate entities administer HAPs. 
 
 Lenders are not required to obtain VA approval of such programs 
before closing the loan.  Home buyer assistance programs that are 
administered by a state, county, or municipal government entity have 
blanket approval for use with VA loans.  These state and local programs are not to be confused with the Department of Defense HAP. 
 HAPs that do not fall under the blanket approval, should forward the 
documentation to the VA RLC with  jurisdiction over property state.   
    
b. 
Requirements Lenders making VA loans involving HAPs must ensure the following: 
 
 the borrower(s) meet(s) VA credit standards,  
 the lender obtains a VA appraisal, and  
 the property must meet VA minimum property standards. 
 
If the sale price of the property ex ceeds the VA reasonable value of the 
property, VA will only allow HAP assistan ce in the form of a grant to pay 
the difference.  Otherwise the Vetera n must pay the difference of price 
over value from his or her own funds without borrowing. 
 
HAPs often require buyers to occupy th e property for a specified period of 
time.  The lender must, at closing, obtain the borrower’s acknowledgement of this requirement , and provide a copy of the signed 
acknowled
gement if VA requests the loan file for review.

 13.  Homebuyer Assistance Program (HAP) , continued 
  
c. HAP Fees Chapter 8 of this handbook lists closing charges that Veteran-borrowers are not 
allowed to pay when a one-percent loan origination fee is charged.  Since HAPs 
are designed to assist low to moderate income buyers, lend ers may not charge 
Veteran-borrowers unallowabl e fees and use HAP funds to offset these charges 
since this practice dilutes the assistance that the HAP was intended to provide.

a. Upload of 
Sales Contract into WebLGY If the Veteran is purchasing a property, the requester must upload a copy of 
the executed sales contract into WebLGY the same day the request is made.  
If the requester does not upload the sales contract, the appraiser must place the

WebLGY notes. 
  
b. Appraiser’s 
Analysis of the Contract The appraiser must analyze all sales c ontracts, options, or listings of the 
subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal, if such information is 
available to the appraiser in the normal course of business.  The appraiser will

e. Amendment 
to the Sales Contract after the Appraisal 
is Completed If the sales contract is amended after the effective date of the appraisal, but 
prior to loan closing, the lender must use due diligence to determine whether 
the amendment(s) could reasonably be t hought to affect the estimated value of 
the property.  If so, the le nder must forward the amende d sales contract to the 
VA fee appraiser for consideration. Th e appraiser will be responsible for 
determining the impact of the amended sa les contract and compliance with all 
provisions of USPAP  in developing and reporting credible assignment results. 
Depending on the extent of any change to the originally considered sales contract, the appraiser may consider  the change to constitute a new 
assignment under USPAP , warranting an additional fee, chargeable to the 
Veteran, up to the full amount of a new appraisal.  
  
f. Due 
Diligence If the lender fails to perf orm due diligence in reviewing any subsequent 
contract amendment(s), and/or fails to forward the contract amendment 
appropriately, the loan may be subject to review for indemnification, or any 
claim against the guaranty may be subject to adjustment.

Change Date March 11, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. Appraiser 
Expectations Appraisers who are appointed to VA’s fee appraiser panel are well qualified, 
experienced appraisers.  Fee panel appraisers are entrusted with the 
responsibility of performing accurate and timely appraisals for VA’s Home 
Loan Guaranty program. While VA fee panel appraisers are not VA 
employees, they are among the most visi ble participants in VA’s Home Loan 
Guaranty program.  Appraisers serv ing on VA’s fee appraiser panel are 
expected to serve Vetera ns and their mortgage le nders in a professional 
manner at all times. VA is committe d to providing the highest level of 
customer service to all Veterans.  
  
b. 
Reassignments 
without Delay If the VA fee appraiser finds that the a ppraisal request must  be reassigned due 
to a conflict of interest or other valid reason, the a ppraiser must immediately 
notif y the RLC to assi gn another appraiser.   
  
c. Appraisal 
Status Fee appraisers may be co ntacted by lender and servi cer employees other than 
SARs inquiring about the status  of the appraisal.  Fee appraisers are expected 
to respond promptly, by the next busin ess day at the latest, providing an 
update on when the appraisal report is  expected to be completed.   
  
d. Email 
Subject Line Timesaver When communicating by email, place the VA Loan Identification Number 
(LIN) in the subject line. Do not incl ude any other information such as the 
borrower’s name or address due to privacy  concerns. Also state the reason for 
the request. 
  
e. Appraiser’s 
Notification to 
a Lender When preparing an origination apprai sal for a purchase, if the estimated 
market value appears to be below the sale s price, the appraiser must notify the 
lender re gardin g additional market data (see Topic 8 of this chapte r).

Clarifications The appraiser may be contacted by the a ppraisal reviewer, ei ther a lender’s or 
servicer’s SAR or VA staff, to discuss the appraisal report.  Appraisers are 
required to respond by the next business day.  If a correction or clarification is 
needed on the appraisal report, a comple te, revised appraisal report must be 
uploaded into WebLGY.  
  
g. Oversight The work of each fee appraiser is subject  to quality review.  Every appraisal 
report is desk reviewed by a SAR or VA staff.  VA takes appropriate action, 
up to removal from VA’s fee appraiser pane l, when appraisers fail to meet 
VA’s expectations for customer service, accurac y, and timeliness.

a.  Lender’s 
Responsibility While only an extremely small numbe r of residential properties are not 
eligible to be the security for a VA-guaranteed loan, it is the lenders 
responsibility to determine that the prope rty is eligible. If the lender fails to 
exercise due diligence in determining eligibility, VA may deny or reduce payment on a future claim based on the in eligibility of the property.  This 
topic covers properties that are eli
gible for an appraisal. 
  
b. Existing 
Construction Properties that have been complete for over 1 year ba sed on the certificate of 
occupancy date, and properties that are less than 1-year old that have been 
previousl y occupie d, are eli gible fo r an appraisal. 
  
c. New 
Construction Properties that have not been previously occupied and are less than 1-year old 
based on the certificate of occupancy da te, and properties which are complete 
except for customer preference items (fl oor coverings, interior finishings, 
appliances, fixtures or other equipment) are eli gible fo r an appraisal. 
  
d. Proposed 
Construction Proposed and under construction properti es are processed under the same 
procedures and include:  
 properties appraised from plans a nd specifications (see Topic 12 of 
this chapter), 
 properties appraised fro m a completed model home (see Topic 13 of 
this chapter), and 
 manufactured homes to be placed on a permanent foundation (see

e. Properties 
Sold by Lenders Foreclosed or “Real Estate Owned” prope rties being sold by lenders may be 
eligible, however, properties must s till meet VA MPRs. Lenders selling their 
own “Real Estate Owned” properties ma y not process these cases under the 
Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LA PP).  These cases must be ordered 
and processed as Individual (IND) appr aisals.  A new construction property 
for which a lender acquired title due to a builder’s bankruptcy or cessation of 
business ma y be eli gible (see Topic 20 of this chapte r). 
  
f. Veteran 
Building Own Home A fully completed home constructe d by a Veteran acting as a general 
contractor for his/her own occupancy ma y be eligible (see Topic 18 of this 
chapte
r).   
  
g. New Home 
Without a 
Warranty A special exception may be granted by VA at the request of a Veteran who is 
purchasing a newly constructed home from a builder who is unwilling to 
provide the required construction warranty  (see Topic 19 of this chapter).   
  
h. 
Manufactured 
Home Classified as Real Estate Manufactured homes that are classified as real estate may be eligible (see 
Chapter 12, Topic 41 of this Handbook). 
 
i. Modular 
Homes Modular homes, including modular on-fra me housing, may be eligible (see 
Chapter 12, Topic 42 of this Handboo k).

k. Leaseholds A leasehold estate or any other prop erty involving less than fee simple 
ownership is eligible fo r appraisal, but must be approved by VA before the 
NOV is issued.  VA’s legal staff will re view the leasehold documents and the 
RLC will notify the requester of the re sults of the review. Copies of the 
following documents must be sent to the RLC in order for the leasehold to be 
reviewed for acceptability:  
 lease identifying the property to be  leased, the lessor, the lease term, 
and the rent, 
 all preceding assignments that may have occurred prior to the current 
assignment,

appraisal if the lender determines that the title meets the requirements 
specified in Chapter 16 of this Hand book.  VA does not maintain a list of 
accepted PUDs.  
  
m. Property to 
be Improved A property to be altered, improved or repa ired is eligible for an appraisal with 
the appraisal prepared “subject to” the satisfactory completion of the work.  
The appraiser must be provided with construction exhibits, or depending on 
the nature of the work involved, docum entation clearly describing the full 
extent of all work to be complete d.  The appraiser will provide an “as 
repaired” value.   Any work that mu st be inspected upon completion must be 
approved b y the local buildin g authorit y.

Change Date March 11, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a.  
Determination 
at Earliest Opportunity Lenders must determine that a property is  not eligible for an appraisal at the 
earliest possible opportunity.  If an a ppraisal is requested and the appraiser 
finds that the property is not eligible, the appraiser should stop working on the 
appraisal and immediatel
y notif y the lender. 
  
b. Properties 
Not Eligible for an 
Appraisal Due 
to Location Properties in the following locations are not eligible for an appraisal: 
 
 Airport Clear Zone (also known as a Runway Protection Zone), if the 
property is proposed construction (s ee Chapter 12, Topic 41 of this 
Handbook), 
 
 Lava Flow Zones 1 and 2 (see Chapter 12, Topic 10 of this 
Handbook), 
 
 Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) area (see Chapter 12, Topic 
9 of this Handbook), 
 
 Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) if  flood insurance is not available 
(see Chapter 12, Topic 8 of this Handbook), 
 
 Area subject to regular flooding, whet her or not it has been designated 
an SFHA (see Chapter 12, Topic 8 of this Handbook), 
 
 Transmission line easement involvi ng high-pressure gas, liquid 
petroleum (see Chapter 12, Topic 40 of this Handbook) or high voltage electricity if any part of the residential structure is within the 
easement (see Chapter 12, Topi c 39 of this Handbook), and 
 
 Area susceptible to geological or so il instability for new and proposed 
construction cases unless the builder provides evidence that the site is 
not affected or the instability has been addressed in the engineering 
desi

c. Property 
Types that are Not Eligible for an 
Appraisal  Properties in the following situations are not eligible for an appraisal: 
 
 A property that does not comply with current zoning regulations, 
however, a “legal non-conforming” use is acceptable and should be 
described in the appraisal (s ee Chapter 12, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
 
 A property that is primarily non-reside ntial is ineligible for VA loan 
guaranty (see Chapter 12, Topic 11 of this Handbook).  
 For new and proposed construction cases, if the local building 
authority routinely performs constr uction inspections, but none were 
conducted, the property is ineligible for VA loan guaranty (see Topic 14 of this chapter).  
 Condo-hotel properties (Condotels) wher e units are placed in a rental 
pool and “air” condominiums that  do not have a homeowners 
association are not elig ible for an appraisal.  (see Chapter 11, Topic 12 
of this Handbook.)  
 A property is ineligible for an apprai sal if any party of interest to the 
transaction, other than the purchaser, is debarred Government-wide, or 
excluded from participation in the Loan Guaranty program due to a 
VA-imposed sanction. Sanctions ty pically involve construction 
complaints or unfair marketing practices.  Lenders must confirm that 
builders of properties appraised as new or proposed construction have 
a valid VA-issued builder ID num ber to ensure that sanctioned 
builders do not particip ate in the VA Home Loan Guaranty program 
(see Topic 11 of this chapter). If th e sanctioned party is a builder, this 
restriction applies to any property still owned by the builder, including 
houses under construction and existing houses.  VA’s refusal to appraise will not be affected by eith er the fact that the local building 
authority approved the work on whic h the sanction was based, or the 
builder changes the company’s name  or organizational structure or 
becomes a principal or officer in another or ganization.

insured protection plan.  In that situati on, all of the following will be required: 
  
 The Veteran purchaser’s written ack nowledgment that, “I am aware 
that this property does not qualify for VA assistance with construction complaints, since it was not insp ected by VA during construction.  I

1-year VA builder’s warranty or a 10-year insured protection plan, as 
is normally required in this situation.”

Change Date March 11, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. Based on 
Fees for Similar Services The maximum appraisal and repair insp ection fees allowed by VA are based 
on customary fees for similar services in that vicinity.  Regardless of the amount of the maximum fee, appraisers must not char ge Veterans more than 
they charge other clients for similar se rvices. VA will entertain additional fees 
in unusual circumstances. 
  
b. Fees Listed 
Online Appraisal and repair inspec tion fees can be found at: 
http://www.benefits.va. gov/HOMELOANS/appraiser _fee_schedule.asp.  
  
c. Mileage Mileage may be charged in accordance with the RLC’s fee schedule.  The fee 
per mile is based upon the GSA mileage rate which can be found at: 
http://www. gsa.gov. 
  
d. 
Certification that the Fee will be Paid When an appraisal is orde red, the requester must cer tify in WebLGY that the 
appraisal fee has been collected and is be ing held to be paid to the appraiser 
before the appraisal request will  be assigned to an appraiser.

Paid by the Requester Appraisers are not authorized  to collect appraisal fees  directly from Veterans.  
Fees must be paid by the requester who placed the appraisal request. 
  
f. No “Rush” 
Fees VA expects the highest level of service will be consistently provided to 
Veterans and their mortgage  lenders.  No fees for “rush” or “priority” service 
are acceptable.

g. Appraisal 
Fee Included on a Claim On liquidation appraisals, the servicer  may request reimbursement of the 
appraisal fee that was paid to the appraiser when filing the claim under 
guaranty. In the event that the borrower requests to pay the full arrears after 
the appraisal is performed, the servicer must include the cost of the appraisal 
in the calculation of the total amount due. 
  
h. Complex 
Properties VA fee and timeliness schedules cover fees for typical appraisals.  Appraisal 
assignments that are complex in nature may require additional resources and 
time.  If an assignment is determined to be complex in nature, appraisers may 
negotiate additional fees with the lender , subject to VA approval.  Fee should 
not exceed what is reasonable and customary for a similar complex property t
ype in the market area.

Change Date March 11, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. 
Declarations Listed Online Lenders are required to check the FEMA website at www.fema.gov/disasters  
for the specific lists of counties and disaster decl aration dates. Disaster 
information is also provided on the VA Home Loan website at 
https://www.benefits.va.
gov/HOMELOANS /, as applicable. 
  
b. Appraisal 
Not Completed 
Before the 
Disaster If the appraisal had been ordered, but the appraiser had not yet visited the 
property before the date of the disa ster, the appraiser will complete the 
appraisal as usual, subject to any MPR repairs.  No additional documentation 
is needed. 
  
c. Appraisal 
Completed -Loan Not Closed Before 
Disaster If the property was appraised on or before the date of the declared disaster and 
not closed prior to that date, the foll owing items must be submitted with the 
VA guaranty request:  
1. Lender’s signed and date d certification that “ This is to affirm that the 
property which is security for VA loan number _________________ has been inspected to ensure that it was either  not damaged in the recently declared 
disaster or has been restored to its pre
-disaster condition or better.” 
 
2. Veteran’s signed and date d certification that “ I have inspected the property 
located at ___________________ and find its condition now to be acceptable 
to me. I understand that I will no t be charged for any disaster -related 
expenses and now wish to close the loan.”  
  
d.  Decrease in 
Value After 
Disaster If there is an indication that the proper ty value may have declined due to the 
disaster, despite the completion of re pairs, the lender must have the  
VA-assigned appraiser perform a new appraisal.  The payment of the 
appraiser’s fee for this se rvice will be a contractual matter between the buyer 
and seller.

 28. Title Limitations 
  
Change Date March 11, 2019  
 This chapte r has been revised in its entiret y. 
  
a. Lender 
Responsibilities If the lender determines th at a title limitation or c ondition discovered prior to 
loan closing may affect eligibility, th e lender must contact the appraiser to 
determine if the property is still eligib le to become the security for a  
VA-guaranteed loan.  If the condition was discovered after the effective date 
of the appraisal, the appraiser may co nsider this a new assignment and an 
additional fee ma y be char ged to the Veteran.  
  
b. VA 
Processing Procedures If VA becomes aware of limitations or conditions which were not considered 
in the appraisal report or covered by 38 CFR 36.4354 , the RLC of jurisdiction 
will:

 Step Action 
1 Obtain a user ID and password for th e Veterans Information Portal (VIP) (see 
Chapter 10, Topic 2 of this Handboo k) 
2 Ensure that the property is eligible for an appraisal.  Contact the RLC with any 
questions about property eligibility or if  the property is not  eligible, but is 
alread y the securit y for a VA loan 
3 
 Request for Certificate of Eligibility (COE) 
4 Log on to VIP and select WebLGY > Re quest Appraisal > Select Appraisal 
Type 
5 Input all requested information to generate VA Form 26-1805-1 , VA Request 
for Determination o f Reasonable Value  
6 To avoid a delay for the Veteran, prov ide a complete legal description and 
ensure that the Point of Contact’s (POC ) information is correct and that the 
POC can provide access to the proper ty for the appraiser without any 
additional calls 
7 WebLGY will: 
- assign a case number (in liquidation cas es, this will be the existing VA loan 
number for the property that must  be provided by the requester) 
- assign an appraiser (since VA is required  by law to select the fee appraiser on 
a rotational basis from a panel maintained by VA) -generate a completed VA Form 26-1805-1 , VA Request for Determination of 
Reasonable Value

  Step Action 
8 If the Veteran is purchasing a home, th e same day the assignment is made, the 
requester must upload a copy of the sales contract and any construction 
exhibits into WebLGY. VA highly r ecommends the use of reduced-size 
construction drawings to save copyin g, mailing, and stor age costs for all 
parties involved. Building plans, elevati ons and details, traditionally drawn at 
¼ inch scale and larger, can be photog raphically reduced or computer-drawn 
to be clearly readable on 8½ by 14-in ch pages. Other exhibits normally 
provided in an 8½ by 11-inch format (suc h as specifications, certifications, 
etc.) must not be further reduced.  VA does not accept 11 by 17-inch pages as this size is not compatible with scanning equipment generally available to pro
gram participants. 
9 For all appraisal types, if the legal desc ription is lengthy and does not fit in the 
legal description block on the appraisa l request, a copy of the complete legal 
description must be uploaded into Web LGY the same day the assignment is 
made. 
10 In most cases, the appraisal will be a ssigned instantly.  If an appraiser is not 
assigned by WebLGY, please notify the RL C of jurisdiction. Requesters must 
not re-enter the information as a duplicate appraisal request will be generated.

Chapter 11: Appraisal Report 
11-3 1. Appraisal Reports 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019  
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. USPAP and 
VA Requirements The appraiser assigned by VA must prepar e the appraisal report in accordance 
with Uniform Standards of Professi onal Appraisal Practice (USPAP), the 
specific VA requirements outlined in this handbook, and in circulars periodicall
y issued when pro gram chan ges arise.  
 
b. Appraisers 
Trained by VA Appraisers who have been appointed to  VA’s fee appraiser panel have been 
trained on VA appraisal requirements.  Lenders may rely on VA fee panel 
appraisers to have perf ormed the appraisal in acc ordance with VA guidelines 
without the need for additional statements or certifications.  
 
c. SAR 
Responsibilities Lenders’ Staff Appraisal Reviewers (S ARs) who are reviewing appraisal 
reports must be familiar with resi dential appraisal pr inciples and VA’s 
specific requirements fo r appraisal reports.

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  
Chapter 11: Appraisal Report 
11-4 2. Market Value 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Market 
Value Definition The appraiser must estimate the market va lue, as "the most probable price that 
a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions 
requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, 
knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.”  
VA considers reasonable value and mark et value to be synonymous.  VA’s 
definition of market value is consistent with that used by Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and ma jor appraisal or ganizations.  
 
b. Protecting 
the Interests of Veterans, Lenders, Servicers and 
VA The quality of the appraisa l is critical in protecting the interests of Veterans, 
lenders, servicers, and VA.  This fact requires VA to be integrally involved in 
its management and oversight of the appraisal process, from the initial 
assignment of the appraiser through the issuance of the Notice of Value 
(NOV), as well as oversight performed on closed loans. 
 
c. Oversight Any appraisal report is unacceptable if the analysis is not based upon 
recognized appraisal practices and was intended to "accommodate" or "meet" 
the sales price.

11-8 4. Gross Living Area 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Definition Gross living area (GLA) refers to the square footage of the area that is 
finished, habitable, contiguous, above-gr ade, residential sp ace calculated by 
measurin g the outside walls of the structure.  
 
b. Non-
Contiguous 
Areas The functional utility and contribut ory value of any non-contiguous areas 
should be considered by the appraiser and listed separately from the GLA on 
the market data grid.  
 
c. Basements Basements, whether or not finishe d, must not be included in the GLA.  
 
d. Attics Finished attics ma y be included in the GLA.  
 
e. Below-Grade 
Areas If any part of a finished level is belo w grade, the appraiser must determine 
whether it should be considered GLA or valued separately.   
 If the appraiser determines that a part ially below-grade habitable space is 
similar to the GLA in de sign, quality of constructi on, and appeal, has full 
utility and is accepted in the market, th e appraiser may include the area in the 
GLA.  
 
If the partially below-grade space is inferi or to the rest of the property and not 
accepted in the market, the appraiser may de termine that the area is not part of 
the GLA. In cases such as these, the contributory value of partially below-
grade space should be considered separatel y on the market data grid.

11-9 5. Room Additions and Car Storage Conversions 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. GLA 
Considerations Room additions and enclosures of gara ges and carports into the living area 
should be included in the GLA if the added space is:  
 accessible from the interior of th e main dwelling in a functional 
manner, 
 has a permanent and sufficient heat source, and 
 is similar in design, qua lity of construction a nd appeal to the main 
dwellin
g. 
 
b. Non-GLA 
Areas Valued Separately Added space that does not meet the criteria listed above must be valued 
separately from the GLA on the market  data grid.  The appraiser must 
consider the effect on mark etability of an inferior addition or conversion when 
arriving at the line item adjustment for the added space. When selecting and 
analyzing comparable sales, the appraise r should consider the differences in 
quality and utility of room additions  and converted spaces when compared 
with ori ginally constructed space.

Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Single Real 
Estate Entity An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is  a living unit including kitchen, 
sleeping, and bathroom faci lities added to or create d within a single-family 
dwelling, or detached on the same s ite.  A manufactured home on the site 
could be an ADU. The dwelling and the ADU together constitute a single real 
estate entit y. 
 
b. Highest and 
Best Use As part of the highest an d best use analysis, the a ppraiser must determine if 
the property is a single -family dwelling with an ADU, or a two-family 
dwelling.  The highest and best use mu st be a legal use (see Topic 10).  A 
two-family dwelling must  be appraised on the Fannie Mae Form 1025 , Small 
Residential Income Propert y Appraisal Report . 
 
c. ADU Valued 
Separately An ADU is usually subordinate in size, location, and appearance to the 
primary dwelling unit and may or may not have se parately metered utilities 
and separate means of ingress and egress.   The appraiser must not include the 
living area of the ADU in the calculati on of the GLA of the primary dwelling. 
The ADU must be valued separatel y as a line item on the market data grid. 
 
d. Notify the 
Lender if More than One Unit The appraiser must notify the lender if  a property has mo re than one ADU. 
 
e. Detached 
Buildings A manufactured home, shed, or other de tached building on the property which 
does not have kitchen, sleeping, and bathro om facilities or cannot be legally 
used as a dwelling, may be valued as storage space if it does not present any 
health or safet y issues.

Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Effect on 
Value While nuisances do not make a property  ineligible or require repair, the 
appraiser must describe an y nuisances and consider an y effect on value.   
 
b. Sales with 
Same Influence If available, comparable sales influe nced by the same nuisance, should be 
used by the appraiser. 
 
c. Examples Examples of nuisances include heavy tr affic, noise from a nearby highway, or 
odors from a factor y in the vicinit y.

11-12 8. Remaining Economic Life 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Factors in 
Estimating Remaining Economic Life Remaining economic life is the es timated period of time until the 
improvements are expected to no longer  serve their intended purpose as a 
home.  In estimating the re maining economic life, the appraiser must consider: 
 
 the relationship between the property and the economic stability of the 
block, neighborhood, and community, 
 comparisons with homes in the same or similar areas, 
 the need for a home of the part icular type being appraised, 
 the architectural design, style and fu nctional utility of the property, 
 the condition and durability of the property, 
 maintenance levels of other properties in the area, and 
 in areas where municipalities have established code enforcement areas, 
their expected results in impro ving the neighborhood for residential 
use. 
 
 
b. Comment if 
Under 30 Years The appraiser must estimate the remain ing economic life as  a single number 
and include specific comments if the es timated remaining economic life is less 
than 30 years. 
 
c. Reporting The estimated remaining economic life must  be provided in the cost approach 
section of the appraisal report. For condominium units , the estimated 
remaining economic life must be provid ed in the “Reconciliation” section of 
the appraisal report.

11-13 9. Effective Age 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Estimating 
Effective Age While the actual age is the number of  years since the home was constructed, 
the effective age reflects the condition and functional ut ility of the property.  
For example, remodeling will likely d ecrease the effective age of a home 
while a lack of maintenance can incr ease the effective age, possibly to a 
number greater than the actual a ge.   
 
b. Comment if 
Significant Change From Actual Age The appraiser must state the effectiv e age as a single number and include 
comments if the effective age differs significantly from the actual age.  
 
c. Completed 
Repairs Considered Since recommended repairs are included in value on origination appraisals, 
the effective age should reflect the c ondition of the property as repaired.

11-14 10.  Highest and Best Use 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Definition The highest and best use of a propert y is the most probable use which is 
physically possible, appropriately suppor ted, legally permissible, financially 
feasible, and results in the hi ghest value.    
 
b. Appraisal to 
Meet VA Guidelines While the appraiser must determine the highest and best use, the appraiser 
must also complete the appraisal in accordance with VA guidelines.  For example, since VA-guaranteed loans ar e made for residential purposes, no 
value may be given to commercial uses , crops, livestock, land for future 
development, or any other non-residential use.

Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Farm 
Residence is an Eligible Property Although VA does not make farm or othe r business loans, Veterans may use 
their VA home loan benefit to purchase a property on which there is a farm 
residence.  
 
b. No Limit on 
Number of 
Acres VA does not set a limit on the number of acres which the property may have.  
The appraisal of properties with acrea ge should not presen t difficulties if 
similar properties in the area were recentl y sold primaril y for residential use. 
 
c. Residential 
Purposes Considered in Valuation Improvements not typically considered residential, for example, barns, 
corrals, or stables, must be valued by the appraiser as they contribute to the 
market value of the property for reside ntial purposes only.  The appraiser must 
not include in value an y livestock, crops, or  farm equipment.

Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. 
Condominium Development Accepted by 
VA All condominium units, including site condominiums and manufactured home 
condominiums, must be locat ed in a condominium deve lopment that has been 
accepted by VA prior to loan guaranty.  SARs receiving an appraisal for a 
condominium unit in a devel opment that has not been  at least conditionally 
accepted b y VA ma y not issue the NOV. 
 
b. Avoid 
Unnecessary Appraisal Fee Ensuring that the condominium is accepted by VA before ordering the 
appraisal is recommended to avoid an unnecessary appraisal fee in the event 
that the condominium is not accepted b y VA. 
 
c. Ineligible 
Property Types Condo-hotel properties where units are placed in a rental pool and “air” 
condominiums that do not have a homeowne rs association are not eligible for 
appraisal as these condominiums do not  meet VA guidelines.  If a question 
arises as to whether or not a condominium would be accepted by VA, VA acceptance should be requested (see subsection 
g of this Topic). 
 
d. HUD/FHA 
Review Process VA no longer accepts HUD/FHA c ondominium approvals as the 
condominium approval requirements di ffer from VA’s requirements.   
 
e. Spot 
Approvals VA does not perform “spot” approval s of individual condominium units 
within a condominium development. 
 
f. 
Condominium List Available Online A list of VA-accepted condominium developments, with any conditions 
needed for approval, and condomin ium ID numbers, may be found at 
https://vip.vba.va.gov/ portal/VBAH/Home  under “Featured Items” in “Condo

i. Appraisal 
Requirements In most cases, the appraiser will prepare the appraisal on Fannie Mae Form 
1073 , Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report .  Appraisals of 
manufactured home condominium units must be prepared on Fannie Mae 
Form 1004C , Manufactured Home Appraisal Report , with the details about 
the condominium development usually pr ovided in the Project Information 
Section of the condominium appraisal fo rm included within the appraisal 
report.  Liquidation appraisals of co ndominium units must be prepared on 
Fannie Mae Form 1075 , Exterior-Only Inspection  Individual Condominium 
Unit Appraisal Report , if interior access wa s not provided.  In the 
Condominium Appraisal Repor t, the appraiser will: 
 
 indicate which utilities are included in the monthly 
homeowners association fee, 
 comment on the adequacy of the monthly assessment, 
based upon the appraiser’s opinion of the adequacy of the 
project’s budget and a comparison to similar 
condominium developments, 
 recommend a fair assessment if the current assessment is 
considered inadequate, and  
 report any known pending litig ation involving the subject 
condominium development or its homeowners 
association.  
 
j. Pre-sale 
Requirement For new condominium developments, a pr e-sale requirement of 70 percent 
must be include d on the NOV and satisfied prior to VA loan guarant y. 
 
k. Wood-
destroying Insect Reports A wood-destroying insect inspection is not required on units in low-rise or 
high-rise condominiums (un its are stacked vertically ), unless the appraiser 
notes a potential infestation probl em.  For site condominiums and 
villa/townhome style condominiums wher e units are side by side, located in a 
“very heavy” or “moderate to heav y” zone, a wood-destroying insect 
inspection must be required on th e NOV unless evidence of a treatment 
guarantee has been provided b y the homeowners association.

11-19 13. Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Definition The UAD improves the quality and consis tency of appraisal data by defining 
all fields required on specific appraisa l forms and standardizes definitions and 
responses for a key subset of fields. Regardless of the geographic location of 
the property or any localized reportin g conventions, the UAD standardization 
includes:  
 Formats for fields that include dates, values, and other data,  
 Allowable values from a list of ch oices provided for certain fields, 
 Abbreviations to allow more inform ation to fit on printed appraisal 
forms, and  
 Ratings and definitions for the “Condition” and “Quality” of the 
propert
y and “Updated/Rem odeled” status. 
 
b. UAD-
Compliant 
Forms Appraisals prepared on Fannie Mae Forms 1004 , 1073 , 1075  or 2055  must be 
UAD-compliant and must include the de finitions for the property condition 
and qualit y ratin gs and the propert y description abbr eviations used.  
 
c. VA Requires 
Closed Sales While the UAD may allow for the use of pending sales in the sales 
comparison grid, VA requires that onl y close d sales be used. 
 
d. Remodeling 
Information UAD requires appraisers to provide  specific information regarding 
remodeling in the past 15 years.  VA expects fee appraisers to recognize and 
describe remodeling or updating and to make appropriate adjustments. Fee 
appraisers should also report UAD info rmation concerning the remodeling if 
it is available in the “normal course  of business” within VA timeliness 
requirements for completion of the appraisal. 
 
e. UAD 
Condition Ratings Since origination appraisals are prepared  “subject to” any repairs needed for 
the property to meet MPRs, UAD cond ition ratings of C5 and C6 are not 
appropriate.

Chapter 11: Appraisal Report 
11-20 14. Sales Comparison Approach 
 
Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Comparable 
Sale Selection The appraiser must include, at a min imum, three closed sales which the 
appraiser believes are the best avai lable sales and provide comments to 
support the selection, when appropriate.  Comparable sales should be selected 
based on similar locational and physical characteristic s, not sales price.  
Recent sales in the same establishe d subdivision, condominium or PUD are 
typically the best indicators of value.   The sales should be similar to the 
subject property to the extent that th e sales would be competing properties if 
they were on the market at the same time as the sub ject propert y. 
 
b. Comments 
Explaining Adjustments The appraiser should provide comment s when adjustments are made for 
points of comparison that are not self-explanatory or  when large adjustments 
are made.  Providing detailed commentary  about the market and comparable 
selection ma y reduce the number of requests for revisions of appraisals. 
 
c. Limited Sales 
Data If the sales data from the market area is  limited, the appraiser must provide the 
best information available and comment s with the apprai ser’s professional 
opinion about the market, any reasons fo r the lack of sales data, and the 
various differences between the sub ject and the comparable sales. 
 
d. Distance of 
Comparable Sales VA does not set minimum or maximum distance requirements between the 
subject and comparable sale  properties.  In suburban or rural communities, the 
market areas may be greatly expanded a nd suitable comparable sales may be 
many miles away from the subject. In su ch cases, the appraiser should specify 
why those comparable sales were us ed and how they compare with the 
subject.  
 
e. Sales of REO 
Properties The appraiser may use sales of Real Es tate Owned (REO) properties or short 
sales if transactions of this nature ar e prevalent in the market.  A transaction 
involving a foreclosure transfer to a mo rtgage servicer is not evidence of 
market value and must not be c onsidered as a comparable sale.

Chapter 11: Appraisal Report 
11-21 14. Sales Comparison Approach , continued  
 
f. Sales From 
Competing Developments If the property is in a new subdivision or condominium, the appraiser should 
include, if available for comparison, properties constructed by a competing 
builder in the subject market area as well as properties within the subject subdivision or condominium. 
 
g. Market-
derived Adjustments All adjustments on the market data gr id should be market-derived, based on 
the amount the appraiser estimates a t ypical buyer would pay for the item in 
the market.  Adjustments reflect contri butory value in the market, which does 
not necessaril y equal the cost of an item. 
 
h. Sales 
Concessions Sales concessions typically include financ ing incentives or non-realty items.  
As all adjustments must be market-der ived, the adjustment should reflect the 
difference between the sale s price with the sales concessions, and what the 
property would have sold for without the concessions under typical market 
conditions.  The sales concessions on th e comparable proper ties are adjusted 
to typical market expectations, not to the specific terms or conditions of the 
sale of the subject. Any concessi on adjustments must be downward 
adjustments as positive ad justments for sales concessions are not acceptable. 
 
i. Recent Sales Comparable sales should reflect the most recent activity in the market.  
Comparable sales are preferably sales that have taken place within the last 6 months, and generally sales that are not more than 12-months old, unless 
explained b
y the appraiser.

j. Time 
Adjustments Market condition (time) adjustments are ma de to reflect value changes in the 
market between the date of the contra ct for the comparable sale and the 
effective date of the appr aisal.  The appraiser mu st provide comments about 
current market trends to support any time adjustments.   In an increasing market, positive mark et condition adjustments should be 
made if there is evidence, based on a thorough analysis of specific market 
trends, of increasing prices, a shorta ge of homes for sale, or decreasing 
marketing times.  In a declining market, ne gative market condition adju stments should be made 
if there is evidence of a decline in prices, an  oversupply, or extended 
marketin
g times.  
 
k. Condition 
Adjustments Since VA appraisals must be prepared “subject to ” the completion of any 
repairs needed in order for the proper ty to meet VA’s MPRs (see Chapter 12 
of this handbook), the condition for the subject property compared with the 
comparable sales on the market data gr id should reflect the condition with the 
repair items completed.

to Value Considered In the final reconciliation on the apprai sal report the appraiser will evaluate 
and summarize the approaches to value which were included in the appraisal report. 
 
b. Market 
Approach  On appraisals prepared for VA, the market approach will likely reflect the 
appraiser’s final estimate of value si nce VA does not require a cost approach 
and an income approach is onl y required on two to f our unit properties.

requested by the servicer no later than  30 days prior to the estimated or 
scheduled sale date. 
 
b. Timeliness 
Standard The timeliness requirement for liquidation appraisals is 5 business days (see 
Chapter 10, Section 7 of this handboo k). 
 
c. Servicer to 
Assist Appraiser in 
Obtaining

e. Vacant 
Property Access Attempts If the property is vacant, th e appraiser must gain access to the interior, unless: 
 
 jurisdictional law prohibits the lender from gaining or assisting in 
gaining access to the property, and the RLC has waived such access, 
 on a case-by-case basis, the RLC has waived access after considering 
other valid extenuating circumstance s (such as, the owner’s personal 
effects remain in a va cant property causing le gitimate concern about 
exposure to litigation), or 
 the RLC has approved a request to wa ive the servicer’s responsibility 
to assist the appraiser in obtainin g access.  
 
f. Requirements 
if No Access Gained If interior access is not gained, the appraiser must:

h. As-is value The fee appraiser’s value estimate for a ll liquidation appraisals will be for the 
subject property in its “as is” condition.  VA li quidation appraisals are 
prepared under the same definition of ma rket value as origination appraisals, 
not a discounted or forced sale value.   Consequently, a property which needs 
no repairs should appraise for the same va lue on a liquidation appraisal and an 
origination appraisal. 
 
i. Liquidation 
Addendum An addendum to the liquidation appraisal must be provided with the following 
information:  
 whether the property is occupied or vacant, 
 whether or not access to the interior was gained, 
 if access was not gained, details of  attempts to gain access must be 
provided in accordance with item d or e above, 
 if the property is vacant, whether or not the property was secure,  
 any repairs urgently needed, su ch as securing the dwelling or 
securing a swimming pool, 
 information about three current list ings or pending sales, including 
the length of time on the market, th e current listing price, any known 
price changes, and a short statem ent describing how each property 
compares to the subject property, and 
 an itemized list of any MPR repair items and any cosmetic items that 
affect the marketability of the prop erty, with the estimated cost and 
the estimated contributory value of each item.  The total contributory 
value of all repairs listed should be  considered by the appraiser when 
making condition adjustments on th e market data grid since 
liquidation appraisals are completed “as is”.

Change Date February 22, 2019 
 This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Partial 
Release Appraisal Request When an appraisal is needed in order to  review a request for a partial release 
of security, VA will assign the appraiser.  The servicer of the VA loan must  
e-mail a request for an apprai sal for a partial release of security to the RLC of 
jurisdiction.  Neither VA Form 26-1805 , Request for Determination of 
Reasonable Value,  nor WebLGY will be used to request a partial release 
appraisal.  The request must in clude the following information: 
 
 Name and address of the servicer, 
 E-mail address of the servicer,  
 VA case number (remains the same from origination of loan), 
 Property address, 
 Name of the property owner and co ntact number for property access, 
 Plot plan or survey of the prope rty showing the pr oposed partition, 
 Identification of the parcel to remain after partial release is 
completed, 
 Legal description for each parcel, 
 Reason for the release of the property (for example, sale, public 
taking, designation as conservation site), and 
 Confirmation that the appraisal f ee will be paid to the VA-assigned 
appraiser upon completion of the ap praisal report and submission of 
an invoice. 
 
b. Appraisal 
Fee The fee for an appraisal for partial rel ease of security purposes is not fixed 
and could vary from the typi cal origination appraisal fee.  The appraisal fee 
will be established by VA, on a case-by-case basis, after consulting with the appraiser.

Chapter 12: Minimum Property Requirements 
12-31. Minimum Property Requirement Procedures
Change Date  October 18, 2019 
•This chapter has been revised in its entirety.
a.MPRs VA has established Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs) to protect the 
interests of Vetera ns, lenders, servicers, and VA. Properties must meet these 
requirements prior to guaranty of the loan by VA.    
b. Appraisal is
Not a H ome
InspectionWhile VA -assigned fee appraisers must note any readily apparent repairs that 
are needed, it is important to distinguish the differences between a real estate 
appraisal and a home inspection report. The fee appraiser will not perform operational checks of mechanical systems or appliances. The fee appraiser estimates the value of the property to ensure that it is sufficient for the amount 
of the proposed loan.  
c. Safe, Sound,
SanitaryMPRs help ensure that the property is safe, structurally sound, and sanit ary.  
The scope of MPRs also includes issues related to the property’s location and 
legal considerations.  
d. Appraisal
Subject to
Repairs to
meet MPRsThe appraiser will prepare origination appraisals “subject to” the completion 
of any MPR repairs that appear to be needed and include the contributory value of the completed repairs in the estimated market value.  Liquidation 
appraisals are prepared “as -is” (see Chapter 11, Topic 20 of this Handbook ). 
e. Recommend
Repairs, N ot
InspectionsAppraisers must not prepare appra isals subject to inspections. The appraiser 
must recommend repairs, not inspections, for any conditions that do not appear 
to meet MPRs.   
f. Cosmetic
ItemsThe appraiser should not recommend repairs of cosmetic items, items 
involving minor deferred maintenance or normal wear and tear, or items that are inconsequential in relation to the overall condition of the property. While minor repairs should not be recommended, the appraiser should consider these items in the overall condition rating when estimating the market value of the 
property.

g.Detached
ImprovementsDetached sheds or other improvments  on the site may be included in value if 
the improvement meets VA’s MPRs.  If the improvement does not meet MPRs 
it must be excluded from value.  If the improvement presents a health or safety hazard, the appraisal must be completed subject to the removal of the 
improvement.  
h.Home
Inspection
RecommendedAfter an origination appraisal is completed, the Notice of Value (NOV) that is 
issued to the Veteran includes a recommendation that the Veteran may wish to 
obtain a home inspection (see Chapter 13, Appendix A of this Handbook). 
i.Local
RequirementsInformation about MPRs concerning properties in specific l ocations are listed 
by state at 
http://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/appraiser_cv_local_req.asp .   
j. SAH Additional MPRs apply to Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) program cases.  
The Regional Loan Center ( RLC ) of jurisdiction should be contacted for 
assistance with SAH questions.

a. Single Real
Estate EntityThe property must be a single, readily marketable , real estate entity.  
b. Multiple
ParcelsMore than one parcel or lot may be included as long as all of the property is 
contiguous and legally marketable. VA does not set a limit on the number of 
acres that the property may have. If the property being appraised includes 
more than one parcel, the appraisal must be prepared subject to placing all of 
the parcels on one deed.  
c. Road or
WaterwayDividing the
PropertyIf a property is divided by a road or waterway, the appraiser must determine 
the effect on the utility of the property to ensure that t he property is a readily 
marketable, real estate entity.

Access  Each property must be provided with a  safe and adequate pedestrian or 
vehicular access from a public or private street with an all -weather surface.  
 
b. Private 
Road 
Requirements  Private roads must be:  
 
• protected by a permanent easement, and  
• maintained by a homeowners association or joint m aintenance 
agreement.  
 
c. 
Maintenance 
Agreement 
Signatures  If a maintenance agreement does not exist, every effort should be made to 
obtain the agreement of all owners of properties on the private road to share the cost of maintaining the road.  
 
d. RLC 
Approval 
Required if the Veteran is Accepting 
Additional 
Responsibility  In the absence of an agreement signed by all owners, particularly those of 
properties located between the subject property and the public road, an agreement by a Veteran to accept respo nsibility for a disproportionate share of 
the road must be reasonable in regards to the distance from the subjec t 
property to the public road. The RLC of jurisdiction must be contacted in order to approve the agreement. VA will not accept an agreement in w hich the 
Veteran accepts sole responsibility for maintaining an unreasonable distance of the private road as this could create a burden for the Veteran as well as 
future property owners.  
 
e. Private 
Street in PUD 
or 
Condominium  If private street maintena nce is covered in the organizational documents for a 
planned unit development ( PUD)  or condominium, or by state law, the NOV 
may be issued without a requirement for further documentation. 
 
f. Easements 
Must R un with 
the L and Each living unit must be acces sible without passing through any other living

Change Date October 18, 2019 
•This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.
a. Soil
ConditionsThe appraiser must report any readily observable soil conditions of the site, 
and other physical features that affect the value of the site. The appraiser 
should also consider any published reports regarding the instability of the soil and surface support of the land concerning the subject and nearby properties. The appraiser must consider any effect on the estimated market value of the 
property.  
b. Subsidence  Subsidence may be encountered where homes are constructed on uncontrolled
fill or unsuitable soil, in locations near mining activity or extractio n of 
subsurface minerals (to include fracking), or where the subsoil or subsurface is unstable and subject to slippage or expansion.  Signs of subsidence may include cracks in the terrain, sinkholes, foundation damage or settlement 
problems.  
c. Dangerous
Subsidence or
SinkholesThe appraiser must report any probable or imminent danger of subsidence or 
sinkholes.  Depending on the extent of the problem, it could be considered a hazard (see Topic 20 of this Chapter) which would make the property 
ineligible.   The appraiser must notify the lender promptly when a hazardous 
condition is found.  
d. Repairs by
ContractorIf a settlement problem that does not have the severity of a hazard is apparent, 
the appraisal must be prepared “subject to repair” by a licensed contractor (for example, step -cracks in an exterior wall, or cracked flooring with significant 
vertical displacement).  
e. Hairline
CracksMinor h airline cracks due to expansion or normal settlement that are common 
in the market area  do not typic ally require repair.

f. New or 
Proposed 
Property  For new or proposed construction properties, in areas that have a history of 
geological or soil instability, the builder must submit either: 
  
• a certification that to the best of the builder’s knowledge and belief, 
any geological or soil -related hazard has been compensated for in the 
engineering design of the improvements and no portion of the 
construction will rest on fill, or  
• evidence from a qualified geologist or engineer that the subject site 
either does not present unusual geological soils -related hazards or such 
hazards have been compensated for in the en gineering design of the 
improvements.  (Qualified geologists are state licensed or are a 
member of a national or state organization which requires responsibility, experience, education and demonstrated ability in the 
field of engineering geology.)

e. Excluding
Non-
Residential
ImprovementsAt the Veteran’s reque st, non -residential improvements such as detached 
garages and small sheds may be excluded from the flood insurance policy if

excluding a detached building may not be worthwhile.   
f. Private
Flood
InsuranceVeterans may elect to obtain private flood insurance instead of obtaining flood 
insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.

 44. Requests for Waiver of MPR Repairs  
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019  
• This c hapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. Waiver 
Requested by 
a Veteran  After the NOV has been issued, at the request of the Veteran, VA will consider 
waiving MPR repairs if the following conditions are met: 
 
• the request is signed by the Veteran,  
• the lender concurs with the Veteran’s request,  and 
• the property is habit able from the standpoint of safety, structural 
soundness , and sanitation. 
 
These requests should not allow for the Veteran to waive MPRs that could 
result in safety issues with the home.  
 
b. Inspection 
Report  In support of the waiver request, while not required, providing an inspection 
report from a licensed professional who is qualified to assess the condition of 
the item in question will ensure the Veteran is fully informed about the 
condition of the item.  
 
c. 
Contributory Value If the request is app roved, VA staff will amend the NOV, removing the repair 
requirement(s). Since appraisals are prepared “subject to” repairs, VA staff may reduce the value by the contributory value of the waived repair(s).  If the contributory value of the repair item(s) is  not material, the NOV may be issued 
without a change in value.  
 
d. Materials 
Shortage 
Following a 
Natural 
Disaster  Following a natural disaster, shortages of materials could delay the completion 
of repairs.  The RLC of jurisdiction should be contacted for consideration of repair waivers  on a case- by-case basis when a Veteran wishes to proceed with 
purchasing or refinancing a home in need of repairs when needed materials are 
not readily available.  
 
e. Escrowed 
Funds for 
Completion of 
Repairs  Depending o n the nature of required repairs, it may be advantageous for the 
Veteran to have the MPR repairs completed after closing on the loan. Lenders 
may hold funds in escrow for repairs to be completed after closing, however all repairs must be completed and escr owed funds distributed before the loan 
may be guaranteed by VA.

13-2 
 1. Issuing the Notice of Value 
 
Change Date July 22, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Appraisal 
Uploaded in 
WebLGY When the fee appraiser uploads the completed appraisal report into WebLGY, 
a lender’s Staff Appraisal Reviewer (S AR) or VA staff must review the 
appraisal and issue a Notice of Value (NOV) to the Veteran.   
 
b. Purpose of 
NOV The NOV will inform the Vete ran about the results of the appraisal report and 
conditions that must be met for guara nty of the loan. The NOV explains how 
appraisal reports differ fr om home inspections and s uggests that the Veteran 
may wish to obtain a home inspection.  
 
c. Processing 
under LAPP Every property eligible for VA’s Le nder Appraisal Processing Program 
(LAPP) should be processed accordingly.  If a LAPP-approved lender does not process an eligible property under LAPP, the request for VA staff to issue 
the NOV must include a detailed explanation. 
 
d. NOV 
Reflects Conditions 
Required for 
the Loan to be Guaranteed Since the NOV reflects the results of  the appraisal review, lenders and 
servicers should refer to th e NOV, not the appraisal, for the reasonable value, 
repair requirements, and all other appr aisal-related conditions required for the 
loan to be guaranteed by VA.

 2. Scope of Appraisal Review 
 
Change Date July 22, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. SAR’s 
Certification of Appraisal 
Review When issuing an NOV in WebLGY, the SAR must electroni cally certify the 
following: “ I reviewed this appraisal report to  determine the acceptability of 
the property for VA Loan Guaranty purposes  in light of VA minimum property 
requirements and the appropriateness, completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the fee appraiser’s reasonabl e value determination. In completing 
this administrative review , I am performing a due diligence function and not 
acting as, or taking the responsibility of, a cosigner of the report or 
supervisory appraiser.  Any disagreement s or comments, etc., resulting from 
the administrative review of this appraisal are fully explained on the 
attachment to this report. ”  (WebLGY notes are considered “the attachment to 
this report” referenced in this certification).  
 
b. SAR’s 
Responsibilities By making this certification together w ith the certifications already made 
when initially approved by VA, the SAR is certifying that he/she: 
 
 personally reviewed the appraisal re port (see Topic 3 of  this Chapter), 
 concurred with the fee apprai ser’s recommendation, except as 
noted in WebLGY notes, 
 did not exert pressure or undue infl uence on the appraiser to change 
information or to reach a predeter mined value for the subject property 
in order to accommodate the sale price or mortgage transaction, and 
 determined that the appraiser used methodologies that were 
appropriate and reasonable in li ght of industry-accepted appraisal 
techniques, made conclusions that  were consistent, based upon the 
data in the report, and complied with applicable VA requirements.

 3. Appraisal Review Process 
 
Change Date April 12, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a. Appraisal 
Report and Electronic Scoring After the appraiser uploads the comple ted appraisal report, the SAR must 
review the appraisal and the results of the electronic scoring of the appraisal 
by VA’s Appraisal Management System  (see Topic 4 of this Chapter). 
 
b. Property 
Eligibility and VA Appraisal Guidelines The SAR must ensure that: 
 
 the property is eligible, and 
 the appraisal report meets VA guideli nes as outlined in Chapters 10, 
11, and 12 of this Handboo k. 
 
c. MPR Repairs The SAR must review the appraiser’ s recommendations for any VA Minimum 
Property Requirement (MPR) repairs and ensure that the property meets or 
will meet VA’s MPRs.  The SAR must  limit repairs required on the NOV to 
only those repairs that are needed for th e property to meet MPRs.  SARs must 
place notes in WebLGY justifying an y non-MPR repairs or inspections 
recommended by appraisers that the SA R has determined are not required on 
the NOV. 
 
d. 
Clarifications 
on the Appraisal During the review of an appraisal, in most cases, when a question arises, the 
SAR should first contact the appraiser for any needed clarifications and 
corrections. The SAR must document a ny contact with the appraiser and 
resolution of appraisal-related concer ns in WebLGY notes. Customer service 
expectations are covered in Ch apter 10, Topic 6 of this Handboo k. 
 
e. Appraisal 
Revisions If the appraiser makes any changes to  the appraisal report, the revised 
appraisal report must be uploaded into WebLGY.

 3. Appraisal Review Process , continued  
 
f. Questions not 
Resolved by an Appraiser If the question is not resolved after c ontacting the appraiser, the SAR should 
email the RLC for assistance.  VA staff will assist the SAR in resolving the question concernin
g the appraisal.  
 
g. Property Not 
Eligible SARs must not issue an NOV for a pr operty that cannot reasonably be 
expected to meet eligibility or VA MPRs  prior to loan guaranty (see Chapters 
10, 11, and 12 of this Handboo k).  
 
h. NOV to 
Reflect Appraiser’s 
Estimate of 
Market Value Once the SAR has determined the apprai sal report is acceptable to VA, the 
SAR must issue the NOV in WebLGY at th e appraised value.  If contact with 
the appraiser resulted in the appraise r uploading an amended appraisal report 
with a changed value, the SAR must issue the NOV at the changed (current) value.  
 
i. Electronic 
Issuance of an NOV The SAR is not required to sign the NOV in ink since the SAR’s name and 
VA-issued ID number are automati cally included on the NOV.  This 
constitutes an electroni c signature since SARs log into WebLGY with a 
unique user name and password. 
 
j. NOV 
Provided to the 
Veteran The same day the NOV is issued, the SAR must send the Veteran a copy of 
the NOV together with a copy of the appraisal report. 
 
k. Actions after 
the NOV Issued After the NOV has been issued: 
 employees of lenders associated with the case will be able to view and 
download copies of the a ppraisal and NOV from WebLGY, 
 Veterans may request a waiver of a repair requirement (see Chapter 
12, Topic 45 of this Handbook), and  
 interested parties may re quest a reconsideration of value (see Chapter 
10, Topic 22 of this Handboo k).

 4. Appraisal Mana gement System  
 
Change Date July 22, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a. Electronic 
Scoring of the Appraisal When the appraiser uploads the comp leted appraisal report into WebLGY, 
VA’s Appraisal Management System (AMS) will electronically read and 
score the appraisal, assisting SARs in quickly assessing appraisal risk, 
determining property eligibility, ensuring VA policy compliance and 
identifying over/under-valuations, and a ppraisal quality issues. SARs must 
use AMS as a tool to help ensure appr aisals are accurate, complete, and that 
the property is properly valued accordi ng to VA-accepted appraisal principles 
and practices. 
 
b. Business 
Rules in AMS As a rules-based system, AMS will assi st SARs in finding inconsistencies by 
flagging items as potentially problem atic, and determin ing whether the 
appraisal is in compliance with VA a ppraisal requirements, industry-accepted 
appraisal principles, and Uniform St andards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP). 
 
c. Alerts 
Provided by AMS Alerts will be noted by the AMS base d on VA’s business rules.  All high 
alerts must be addressed in WebLGY notes.  Medium and low alerts do not 
require a comment, but should be carefu lly reviewed by the SAR.  Often the 
alerts will reflect an NOV conditi on that must be required, with no 
clarification needed from the appraiser. 
 
d. VA Guidance 
on Specific 
AMS Scores VA will issue a circular periodically de scribing the AMS scores that will be 
considered low-risk and high-risk appr aisals.  SARs may perform a cursory 
review on low-risk appraisals.  High-r isk appraisals require a comprehensive 
review. Sometimes a score of “N/A” w ill be reported for complex, rural, or 
new/proposed construction properties due to a lack of market data.  While this 
is not an indication of a high-risk appraisal, a comp rehensive review must be 
performed since the AMS did not return  a score within the acceptable range 
for a cursory review.   SARs must in dicate whether or not a cursory review 
was performed in WebLGY with the indi cator on the screen where the NOV 
is issued.

e. Cursory 
Review of an Appraisal Cursory review requirements include: 
 reviewing the sales comparison grid, 
 confirming that the report contains  the required photographs (see 
Chapter 11, Topic 3 of this Handbook)  which accurately reflect the 
appraiser’s description of the su bject and comparable properties, 
 identifying all VA MPRs that must be addressed before the property 
can become the security for a VA-guaranteed loan, 
 reviewing any alerts identified by the AMS, documenting any high 
alerts in WebLGY notes, and 
 identifying any additional conditions  that must be included on the 
NOV. 
 
f. Findings 
upon Cursory Review Findings in a cursory review may cause th e review process to be elevated to a 
comprehensive review. 
 
g. Additional  
Requirements for a 
Comprehensive 
Review Comprehensive review requirements incl ude the requirements specified above 
for a cursory review and: 
 verifying that the appraisal report is fully completed, 
 verifying that the appraisa l meets USPAP requirements, 
 verifying that the appraisal complies with the Uniform Appraisal 
Dataset (UAD) requirements, 
 determining that the appraiser's methodology is appropr iate and that 
the appraiser's conclusions are c onsistent, sound, suppor table, logical 
and based upon data in th e appraisal report, and  
 ensuring that the appraiser’s ma rket value estimate and other 
conclusions are consistent with those in similar cases recently 
processed. 
 
h. Systems Not 
in Operation If system issues arise and AMS results are not available, the SAR may 
perform a comprehensive review, noting in WebLGY that AMS results were not available.  If WebLGY is not available, the SAR may issue the NOV outside of WebLGY, entering the NOV in  WebLGY when the system is back 
online.  A note should be entered do cumenting that this procedure was 
followed.

Change Date July 22, 2019  
 This chapter has been revised in its entiret y. 
 
a. Importance 
of Prompt Issuance of an NOV VA is committed to providing expediti ous service to Veterans.  It is 
advantageous to Veterans to receiv e the NOV well ahead of the scheduled 
loan closing. 
 
b. Timeliness 
Expectation The SAR must issue the NOV within fi ve business days from the time the 
completed appraisal is uploaded into  WebLGY, unless ther e is a delay beyond 
the SAR’s control.  An y dela ys should be explained in WebLGY notes.

NOV 
Conditions The following table lists th e conditions that appear on the NOV form with 
details about when each condition is  required on the NOV. The NOV letter 
format is provided in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.

c. Table of 
NOV 
Conditions, continued   
NOV Condition Details for includi ng this condition on an NOV 
1. Energy Conservation Item 1a should be marked on NOVs for existing 
properties (over 1-year old or  previously occupied) to 
allow lenders to increase th e loan amount for Veterans 
wishing to make energy efficiency improvements (see Chapter 7 of this Handbook).  Item 1b should be marked on NOVs for new or proposed construction excluding manufactured homes . For new and proposed 
manufactured homes, energy efficiency is already 
covered by the manufacturer’s  guidelines (see Chapter 
12, Topic 42 of this Handbook) so this item should not 
be marked.   
2.  Wood Destroying 
Insect Information If the property is located in  an area on the Termite 
Infestation Probability Map where the probability of termite infestation is "ver y heavy" or "moderate to 
heavy," a wood destroying insect inspection report must be required on the No tice of Value (NOV).  Mark 
2a if the property is exis ting or new construction, or 
item 2b if the property is proposed. For new construction, if a soil trea tment guarantee is provided, 
this is preferable and will  satisfy condition 2a.  The 
pest control operator must me et all state requirements. 
State-required inspectio n forms are acceptable.  
Inspection reports are valid for 90 days.  Soil treatment 
guarantees differ from an inspection and are 
consequently valid well beyond 90 days.  A wood-destroying insect inspection is not required on units in 
low-rise or high-rise condominiums (units are stacked vertically) unless the appraiser notes a potential infestation problem.  For s ite condominiums, and villa 
or townhome style condomin iums where units are not 
vertically stacked, an insp ection must be required on 
the NOV unless evidence of a treatment guarantee has 
been provided b y the homeowners association.

NOV Condition Details for includi ng this condition on an NOV 
3. Lien-Supported 
Assessment If the property is located in a planned unit 
development (PUD) or condominium, mandatory 
homeowners association fees  must be shown on the 
NOV.  Special assessments in cluding local authorities 
collecting Community Deve lopment District (CDD) 
fees or other fees on th e HOA’s behalf should be 
reported here as well.  
4. Condominium If the condominium is conditionally accepted by VA, 
this item should be marked.  This item is not required 
if the condominium is fully accepted by VA.  If the 
condominium has not been  accepted by VA, the NOV 
must not be issued.  (See Ch apter 11, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
5. Private Road/Shared Driveway If access to the property is by a private road or shared 
driveway, this item shou ld be marked, unless the 
property is in a PUD or condominium with private 
streets which are covere d by the organizational 
documents.  If a state law es tablishes requirements for 
the maintenance of private ro ads, this condition is not 
needed on the NOV.  
6. Flood Insurance If the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard 
Area, this item must be marked. It is the lender's responsibility to ensure that flood insurance is obtained and maintained on properties located in 
SFHAs, whether or not the appraiser correctly identifies the property as being in an SFHA.  If flood insurance is not available, a property in a SFHA is not eli
gible to be the securit y for a VA- guaranteed loan. 
7. Water/Sewage System Acceptability If the property has an individual water supply, such as 
a well, this condition must be marked.  For proposed 
construction cases, acceptance of an individual sewage 
system must be required.  Acceptance of the sewage system is also require d for existing or new 
construction cases in which th ere is an indication of a 
problem or the property is in an area known to have 
soil percolation problems. Ce rtifications are valid for 
90 da
ys unless the local authorit y indicates otherwise.

Water and/or Public Sewe
r This condition is required onl y if the property does not 
have public water and/or se wer and the state or local 
authorit y has mandated connection to  public utilities.    
9. Repairs The repairs recommende d on the appraisal should be 
reviewed and only those wh ich are needed for the 
property to meet VA MPRs  should be listed on the 
NOV.  Any apparent defec tive conditions observed by 
the appraiser must be addressed by requiring correction, rather than an inspection.  The completion 
of any repairs that could i nvolve lead-based paint must 
be certified b y the fee appraiser. 
10. Post Construction 
Inspection This condition must be marked on all proposed 
construction properties a nd properties appraised 
subject to alterations such  as a room addition. 
11. New Construction 
Inspections/Warranty For new construction properties, either 11a or 11b 
must be required based on whether or not local 
building inspections are performed.  Since new construction must have eith er a 1 year or a 10-year 
warrant
y, either 11c or 11d must be marked. 
12. Proposed Construction Inspections/Warranty For proposed construction pr operties, either 12a or 
12b must be required based on whether or not local 
building inspections are performed.  Warranty requirements are determined accordin
gly.

[Reminder: The NOV must be ma iled or emailed to the Veteran on the date issued.] 
 
[on lender's letterhead] 
 
LENDER'S NOTICE OF VALUE 
 [date NOV issued]   [Veteran’s name]      LENDER LOAN #: [Veteran’s current address]      VA CASE #: [Veteran’s city, state, zip code]    A PPRAISAL REVIEWER:  [SAR name, SAR id #] 
PROPERTY ADDRESS:  [complete address] 
 
Dear [Mr. or Ms.]  [Veteran’s last name]:  
The above property has been apprai sed by a fee appraiser assigned by th e VA Regional Loan Center in [ 
RLC City and State]. On [date NOV issued], the VA-author ized appraisal reviewer pe rsonally reviewed the fee 
appraiser's report and determined th e property's estimated reasonable valu e to be $[ value ]. The maximum 
repayment period for a loan secured by this property is [30 years or estimated remaining economic life on 
appraisal, whichever is less].   
   
The VA appraisal was made to de termine the reasonable value of the property for loan purposes. 
The appraisal must not be considered a building insp ection. Neither VA nor the lender can guarantee that 
the home will be satisfactory to you in all respects or that all equipment will operate properly. A thorough 
inspection of the property by you or a reputable in spection firm may help mini mize any problems that 
could arise after loan closing. In an existing home, particular attention should  be given to plumbing, 
heating, electrical and roofing components. VA recomm ends testing for radon, which the government has 
determined can cause lung cancer.   
   
REMEMBER: VA GUARANTEES THE LOAN, NOT THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY

Construction Inspections 
Overview 
  
Purpose  The purpose of VA inspections during constr uction is to ensure that all onsite 
and offsite improvements have been  acceptably completed according to 
 
 the construction exhibits on which th e VA value estimate is based, and 
 VA Minimum Property Requirement s (MPRs) per Chapter 12. 
  
Consequences 
of Inspections A lender may close a loan based on a “clear” final inspection report. 
 Deviations from the construction exhib its may necessitate revision of the VA 
value estimate, if  appropriate. 
 Properties that fail to meet VA MPRs will not be acceptable as the security 
for a VA loan. 
   
Determining 
the Type of 
Inspection Use the table below to determine the type of inspection required.  
When the property is appraised 
as ... Then ... 
proposed or under construction 
with no insured te n year protection 
plan  either a full complement of 
inspections is required, or  
 a final (third stage) inspection is 
required, only if local building authority inspections are acceptable in lieu of VA first and second stage inspections. 
proposed or under construction 
with an insured ten  year protection 
plan only a final (third st age) inspection is 
required.

14.01  Obtaining an Inspection 
  
How to Assign an Inspector  VA assigns, without favoriti sm or discrimination, an  inspector from its fee 
inspector roster  
 at the same time as the appr aiser, in most cases, or 
 at the time a notice of value is issued  by VA staff, if the appraisal requester 
does not choose to have the inspecto rs assigned at the same time as the 
appraiser and the value determination will be made by VA staff. 
 
VA may assign more than one inspector in the case of master appraisals. 
 Reference :  For information about assigning a fee inspector, refer to Section 
10.04. 
   
Early Start 
Assignments To avoid builder delays in starting construction, VA can a ssign the inspector 
prior to assigning the appraiser.  The bu ilder or sponsor must submit a written 
request which includes  
 a statement of understanding of the speci al nature of the procedure and the 
fact that inspection fees will be paid  whether or not a VA value notice is 
issued, and 
 construction exhibits which are prop erly certified in accordance with 
Section 10.10, Construction Exhibits . 
  
Requesting an 
Inspection The builder contacts the inspector directly to sc hedule inspections as each 
phase of construction is completed. 
  
Inspection 
Report Form  All compliance inspections w ill be reported on VA Form 26-1839,

14.02  Inspection Stages 
  
Introduction This topic contains information about  
 
 displaying legal notices 
 the stages of inspection 
 what inspectors look fo r during the inspection 
 re-inspections 
 special inspections, and 
 missed inspections. 
  
Equal 
Employment Opportunity Poster 
Requirement At the initial inspection, in spectors will note any failure of the builder to 
prominently display VA Poster 26-83- 1, Equal Employment Opportunity is 
the Law, as a noncompliance item on th e inspection report.  Each contractor 
and subcontractor must disp lay the poster in conspic uous places at job sites 
covered by VA value notices fo r proposed construction.   
 In all areas with signifi cant concentrations of Spanish-speaking people, VA 
Poster 26-83-1(S) printed in Spanish, mu st be displayed next to the poster in 
English.  When noncompliance with the poster re quirement is found, the VA office of 
jurisdiction will immediately inform th e builder that no further inspections 
will be made until the poster is displa
yed.  
    
Obtaining 
Equal Employment Opportunity 
Posters VA supplies the poster to the builder with the VA value notice, if issued by 
the VA.  Although one poster may be used to cover a group of properties being constructed simultaneously by a builder, VA will furnish additional posters needed for ad equate coverage.   
 Posters are available from the VA Forms and Publications Depot.

Special 
Inspections VA may also require special inspections  by the VA-assigned fee inspector at 
any stage of construction to help monitor cases involving  
 
 unusual site features 
 construction methods, or  
 builders with frequent construction complaints. 
 
For cases involving  major  alteration or repair wor k, the stages at which 
special inspections are to be made will be determined according to the nature of the proposed work. 
 
Re-inspection A re-inspection is required 
 
 whenever a first- or second-stage, or special inspection shows 
noncompliance and the work involved w ill be concealed before the next 
regular inspection, or 
 as a result of noncomplian ce or incomplete work re ported at the third-stage 
inspection, unless the VA field station waives the re-inspection because  
 the incomplete work is of a minor nature, and  
 the lender is willing to certify that it has been satisfactorily completed. 
 
Missed 
Inspections Occasionally a required in spection may be missed through oversight by the 
builder or other party responsible fo r requesting them.  To waive a missed 
inspection, the VA field office  must be provided with 
 
 a written request signed by the lender and the veteran 
 evidence that the local building author ity inspected the construction at the 
stage(s) not inspected by VA, and 
  
 Note :  In areas without local inspections  at prescribed construction stages, 
the VA inspector must provide a stat ement regarding his/her experience 
with the quality of the builder’s workmanship and the builder’s conformity with both constructions exhibits submitted to VA and VA minimum 
property requirements.

15-1 Chapter 15. Lender Appraisal Processing Program 
(LAPP) 
Overview 
  
Change Date June 28, 2010, Change 14 
 This section has been updated to add subsection lettering and to make 
minor grammatical edits. 
  
a. Purpose of 
LAPP The purpose of the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) is to 
speed up the time to loan closing by allowing VA-authorized lenders to 
receive appraisal report s directly from appraise rs and process them 
without VA involvement. 
  
b. How LAPP 
Works There are basically four st eps in processing LAPP cases. 
 
Stage Description 
1 The LAPP lender requests VA assignment of a fee appraiser 
and a VA loan number (same as a ny other case) and identifies 
the case as “LAPP.” 
2 The VA-assigned appraiser sends the appraisal report directly 
to the LAPP lender’s VA-approve d staff appraisal reviewer 
(SAR). 
3 The LAPP lender’s SAR 
 
 reviews the appraisal report fo r completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques as 
well as other VA requirements, 
 determines the reasonable value of the property and any 
conditions which must be met prior to VA guaranty of the 
loan, and 
 sends the veteran buyer a writ ten notice of the value which 
includes any conditions or requirements upon which the VA 
loan guarant y is contin gent. 
4 The LAPP lender then underwrite s and closes the loan on the 
automatic basis and requests VA guarant y.

e.  Location of 
SAR There is no restriction on the location of a lender’s SAR. 
  
f.  Geographic 
Extent of LAPP Once a SAR has satisfied the LAPP training and initial case review 
requirements (SAR Training and Initial Case Reviews in this chapter), their LAPP authority may be used fo r properties in any state in which 
the lender has authority to close loans under the auto matic procedure. 
 If a lender’s automatic authority is extended into a ne w state, their 
SAR’s LAPP authority is immediately extended as well.  Note :  It is the SAR’s responsibility to stay informed about any local 
VA processing requirements unique to  the VA jurisdiction in which a 
propert

 SAR is employed by or performs apprai sal review services for another 
lender.

15-5 15.02 Lender Quality Control System Requirements 
  
Change Date June 28, 2010, Change 14 
 This section has been updated to add subsection lettering, add hyperlinks, 
and to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Introduction To qualify for LAPP authority, the lende r must have an effective quality 
control (QC) system which ensures th e adequacy and quality of its staff 
appraisal reviews.  This QC system mu st be independent of  the lender’s loan 
production operation.  Upon request, the lender must agree to furnish VA with findings and 
information about the system.  The seni or officer must certify on each SAR’s 
Lender's Staff Appraisal Reviewer  Application (SAR) Application, VA Form 
26-0785 , that the QC s ystem meets the requirements detailed in this section. 
  
b. QC 
Reviewers Reviews of the SARs’ work may be pe rformed by an independent party or 
independent internal audit division which reports directly to the lender’s chief 
executive officer.  QC personnel shou ld possess a basic familiarity with 
appraisal theory and techniques and th e ability to prescribe appropriate 
corrective actions when problems in the appraisal review process are 
identified. 
  
c.  Frequency 
and Scope of Reviews Perform desk reviews of each SAR’s appraisal reviews on a routine basis 
(monthly or quarterly).  Th e sample size should be no less than 5 percent of 
the SAR’s LAPP cases processed monthl y or a minimum nu mber of cases 
(for example, five cases).  There must be a procedure for expanding the scope of the reviews if a pattern 
of deficiencies is identified.

d.  QC Review 
Criteria QC reviews should consider the: 
 
 overall quality of the SAR’s appraisal review, 
 acceptability of the property in light of VA minimum property 
requirements, and 
 appropriateness of the reasona ble value determination. 
  
e.  Maintenance 
of VA Publications The QC system must provide assurance that all current pertinent VA 
regulations, directives, and other rele ases are maintained and immediately 
available to the qualit y control personnel and SARs. 
  
f.  Management 
Notification and Corrective Action The QC system must provide for written notification of deficiencies cited as a 
result of audits or reviews at least qu arterly to the lender' s senior management 
or chief executive officer. 
 
The QC system must require senior ma nagement to promp tly initiate and 
document actions to correct deficienci es and provide SARs with corrective 
instructions. 
  
g.  Review of 
VA Fee Panel 
Appraisals In addition to reviews of the SARs’ work, random field reviews of VA fee 
panel appraisals should be performe d.  These reviews can be done by the  
SAR, or an independent appr aiser on a contract basis. 
 
Note : Formally report any substantive ne gative findings to  the VA Regional 
Loan Center where the appraiser is a member of the fee panel.

VA will be considered.  For each SAR approval request, incl ude a $100 processing fee plus the 
information, statements and certific ations exactly as  detailed on the 
application, either on lender  letterhead or attached to a statement on lender 
letterhead which references it.  The same procedure applies to subs equent requests for VA approval of 
additional SARs. 
  
b.  Notification 
of VA Decision The VA regional office will review the application materials submitted and 
notify the lender of its decisi on as quickly as possible.

it will inform the lender that the SAR must fulfill the SAR Training and Initial 
Case Review  requirements detailed  in this chapter. 
  
c.  SAR ID 
Number The notice from VA will provide a permanent ID number for each SAR 
approved.  The SAR always retains the sa me ID number, even if he or she

 This section has been updated to add subsection lettering, add hyperlinks, 
and to edit minor grammatical errors. 
  
a.  SAR No 
Longer Employed or 
Performing  
SAR Work The lender must promptly notify VA if the Staff Appraisal Reviewer is no 
longer employed or is no longer functioning as an SAR for the lender.  If either of these two apply, the SAR’s LAPP authority automatically ceases and the lender’s eligibility to participate in LAPP is terminated if that individual was the lender’s onl

Diligence Lenders are expected to exercise due  diligence in processing LAPP cases and 
are responsible for complyi ng with all applicable:  
 
 VA policies and procedures,

 VA considers due diligence to be care which is properly expected from, and 
ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent lender who is entirely 
dependent on the sub
ject propert y as a securit y to protect their investment. 
  
b.  What LAPP 
Lenders Can Expect In assuming the responsib ilities involved with proce ssing an appraisal under 
LAPP and subsequently underwriting the VA loan on the automatic basis, the 
lender has reasonable certain ty that the VA Form 26-1899,  Loan Guaranty 
Certificate , will be issued by VA, except in cas es of fraud or willful material 
misrepresentation by the lender.  Reference :  See Chapter 17 , Section 4. 
  
c.  LAPP 
Privilege LAPP authority is a privilege delega ted to lenders at VA’s discretion.  
Lenders maintain this privilege by complying with all applicable LAPP-related requirements.    If VA finds proper cause, the privileg e extended to lenders under LAPP may 
be: 
 amended, 
 suspended, or 
 withdrawn. 
 Reference :  For more information, refer to Chapter 17 .

Unit Developments 
Overview 
  
What is a 
Common Interest Community A common interest community is a subdivision containing common land, often including 
recreational amenities.  That common property is  typically owned by an association of the 
homeowners (HOA), to which they all must belong and pay lien-supported assessments for a 
proportionate share of the expenses of the HOA. 
 Condominiums and planned unit developments (PUDs) are common interest communities. 
  
Basic VA 
Requirements There are VA requirements applicable to all properties  located in either a PUD or 
condominium.  Also,  condominiums  (but not PUDs) must be approved  by VA before any 
lots or units in the project are eligible for VA loan guaranty.

16-A.01  Requirements Applicable to All Properties in 
Common Interest Communities 
  
Introduction  While only condominiums must be approved by VA, lots or units securing VA loans  
in condominiums and other planned unit developments must meet both title and lien-related VA 
regulatory requirements.  The lender is responsible for ensuring that these requirements are met for 
each VA loan.  Although there is no specific VA requirement that lenders maintain evidence in the 
loan file that these requirements are met, they may wish to be guided by the advice of their legal 
counsel in this regard. 
 
Acceptable 
Title The title requirements for every VA loan, whether or not the property is located in a common 
interest communities, are stated in VA regulations 
(38 CFR 36.4350 ).  These requirements indicate 
 
 the estate must not be less than fee si mple, except under certain circumstances ( 38 CFR 
36.4350(a) ) 
 title must to be subject to unreasonable restrictions o use and occupancy, except under 
certain circumstances ( 38 CFR 36.4350(b) ), and 
 certain minor title limitations will not be consid ered by VA, to the extent described, as 
materially affecting the value of the property 
 (38 CFR 36.4350 (c) ). 
[38 CFR 36.4350]  
[38 CFR 36.4350 (a)]  
[38 CFR 36.4350 (b)]  
[38 CFR 36.4350 (c)]  
  
Superior VA 
Lien VA regulations require that every VA loan be secured by a first lien on the property, except 
under certain circumstances.  ( 38 CFR 36.4351  and 38 CFR 36.4352 ) 
 
When a property is located in a condominium or planned unit development, the lender must ensure that any mandatory homeowner association assessment is subordinate to the VA-
guaranteed mortgage.

the appraisal report must include them and their impact on the value of the residential units.  
In declarant/developer controlled condominium conversions , the appraiser must 
 
 ascertain the degree to which the converted structure and unit(s) has been or will be

How to 
Expedite VA 
Approval HUD/USDA Approval  
Generally, projects already approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or the United States Department of Ag riculture (USDA) do not need further VA 
review.  Upon receipt of evidence of HUD /USDA approval, such as a copy of the 
HUD/USDA approved project list or the project approval letter, the VA office of jurisdiction adds the project to the nationwide VA list without issuing a formal VA approval letter. 
 
In rare cases, HUD or USDA may approve a project that VA discovers does not comply with VA regulations.  In those cases, VA notifies the lender as soon as practicable that it will not 
guarantee loans in the project. 
 Use of Attorney’s Opinion  
This is a highly recommended options for condominiums that have not been approved by 
HUD or USDA.  
Reference :  See Section 16-B. 
 
Use of Previously Approved Documents  
When the organizational documents being submitted are essentially the same as a set previously approved by VA, the lender/spons or should include a certification from the 
declarant or declaran t’s attorney which 
 
 states the fact 
 specifically identifies the previous set, and 
 describes any variation to the previous set. 
 
State Agency Certification of a Condominium  
If a state agency certifies that the condominium has been created  in compliance with the laws 
of the state in which it is located, include the certification.

agreement from the declaran t/developer relinquishing 
the ob
jectionable provisions.

Document 
Amendments 
After Project Approval VA recommends that declarants have amen dment procedures for the declaration or 
equivalent document, amendable by an instrument approved by not less than 67 percent of unit owners.  The association must request VA approval of proposed amendments prior to 
recordation. 
 VA approval of any amendments to the declaration, bylaws, or other enabling documentation 
is required while the declarant is in control of the homeowner’s association.  A written 
statement signed by an officer of the Associ ation’s Board of Directors and submitted with 
VA Form 26-1844, is required as evidence of approval. 
 
Changes made by the declarant prior to the first sale in a condominium project may require amendment of the organizational documents. 
 
Note :  VA approval is not required for amen dments which annex additional phases to the 
condominium in accordance with a development plan previousl
y accepted b y VA. 
 
Mortgagee 
Rights The condominium documents may specify the following rights for the holders of first 
mortgages, provided the lender  makes a written request to the Association for the right, and 
includes 
 
 prior approval by first lienholders before the Association can 
 abandon condominium status or partition or subdivide a unit or the common elements 
 change the percentage interest of unit owners, or 
 materially amend the legal documents 
 timely written notice to first lienholders of 
 any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, and 
 substantial damage or destruction to the common elements 
 the right to 
 examine the asso ciation books 
 receive annual audited financial statements and record, and 
 be given notice of association meetings an d be entitled to a representative at such 
meetings.

Compliance 
With VA Regulations The attorney’s opinion must address compliance of the organizational documents with VA 
regulations 38 CFR 36.4356  through 36.4360a(g)  for condominiums. 
 Reference :  [38 CFR 36.4356  throu
gh 38 CFR 36.4360a(g) ] 
  
Compliance 
with Other VA Requirements The attorney’s opinion must address compliance of the organizational documents with the 
technical areas discussed in Exhibit A. 
  
Compliance 
with 
Local/State Requirements The actual attorney’s opinion must 
 
 address compliance of the organizational docu ments with the material requirements of 
applicable state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal requirements 
governing the creation of property owners associations as of the date of the opinion, and 
 identify the above applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and legal requirements by name

approvals unless otherwise provided in the declaration, an d consistent with existing local jurisdiction’s zoning 
and subdivision ordinances, to transfer part of the common areas for the purpose of adjusting lot lines in accordance with reason ably stated provisions (i.e., does not reduce total open space area below zoning

9. Contains provisions for the adoption of an annual operating budget and imposition and collection of 
assessments to meet the expenses of the association.  The board of directors has the power on behalf of the 
association to levy both annual and additional assessments.  
 a.  Units of a similar nature, receiving similar services , are assessed on a uniform basis except for the reduced 
assessment permitted for unoccupied units owned by the decl arant or a builder.  If a different basis is used 
which allocates assessment liability among unit based on diffe rent services provided to the units or the different 
nature of the units, the rationale for that basis must be fully explained. 
 
b.  If the declarant furnishes a multi-year feasibility b udget, the declarant and/or a builder may pay a reduced 
annual assessment on unoccupied lots only provided that  such reduced assessment is not less than 25% of the 
full annual assessment.  Alternativel y, the declarant or builder may pay a one-time assessment equal to 25 
percent of the applicable annual assessment per lot based upon the first year budget at maximum build-out (or 5 years out for projects involving 250 or more lots/units).   The lots for which the one-time assessment has been 
paid may be exempt from further assessment until the ear lier of: (i) initial occupancy or (ii) two fiscal years 
after submission to the declaration.  If unoccupied units are receiving th e benefit of the reduced or one-time 
assessment, the documents provide that the declarant, or builder(s) as approp riate, must provide for or pay for 
all maintenance to such units and shall fund all operatin g budget deficits incurred during the declarant control 
period, including reserves based upon expected lives of items for which reserved, but not including shortfalls 
caused by nonpayment of assessments by other members or extraordinary expenditures (e.g., expenses caused 
by natural catastrophes or environmental hazards).  A unit initially occupied or conveyed to a unit owner other than the declarant or a builder is fully  assessed.  The obligation to fund bu dget deficits is a lien against all the 
land owned by the declarant (or the declarant and builders) in the planned unit development.

10. If a maximum annual assessment is st ated, the maximum may increase auto matically by the greater of ten 
percent or based upon a Consumer Price Index, such as the U.S. Department of Urban Price Index - All Urban 
Consumers (1982-84=100) or other comparable index reflecting the association’s cost increase experience each 
year.  The maximum may also be increased by a majority  vote of the members obligat ed to pay such assessment 
or with the written approval of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number  of authorized votes of 
members obligated to pay such assessment (in both cases  excluding the declarant du ring the declarant control 
period).  Increases in certain fixed costs for insurance, taxes, recycling or waste disposal may be passed through to the members, by permitting an automatic increase in the maximum assessment which reflects those increases.  
If no maximum assessment is set forth, a vote of the members must be required to approve capital expenditures, 
other than for repair and replacement, during a fiscal year of more than 20 percent of the budget for common expenses for that fiscal year. 
 
11. Contains provisions for a lien-supported assessment.  The assessment lien of any assessment levied by the 
association is subordinate to the lien of a first mortgage  (Title 38, USC, section 3703(d)(3)).  Subordination to 
other security interests or liens is acceptable if permitted by applicable law.  The sale  or transfer of any unit 
pursuant to mortgage foreclosure of a first mortgage or any proceeding in lieu thereof extinguishes the lien of 
such assessments as to payments which became due prior to  such sale or transfer.  No  sale or transfer relieves 
such unit from liability for any assessments thereafter be coming due or from the lien thereof.  (NOTE: VA will 
not recognize any limited priority that common expense a ssessments may have over the first mortgage lien.  
Mortgage holders should be aware that no VA claim pa yment will be made to holders for any payments they 
may have made to clear prior liens for delinquent and unpaid association assessments).

12. Contains provisions for collection of assessments.  The in terest rate permitted to be charged by the association 
is uniform, reasonable and non-usurious.  The method of de termining the interest rate is set forth.  A rate not to 
exceed that charged by the Internal Revenue Service on delinquent taxes is considered reasonable.  The 
association has the power both to foreclose the associatio n's lien and to bring a legal action against the member 
personally obligated to pay the asse ssment.  The documents may provide th at a successor in title is entitled to 
obtain an association disclosure statement or estoppel certificate with respect to common expense assessments, 
in which case an owner's personal obligation to pay a ssessments is assumed by su ccessors in title unless the 
successor in title acquired title through fo reclosure, or any proceeding in lie u thereof, of a first mortgage.  
(NOTE: Units which will be subject to  a VA-guaranteed loan will not be s ubject to delinquent assessments in 
excess of 6 months in any case in which the associatio n has not brought enforcemen t action against the current

  17-1  Chapter 17 
VA Sanctions Against Program Participants 
Overview 
 
Introduction VA is authorized to impose sanctions against persons or entities who take 
actions which are detrimental to the VA loan guaranty program.  The type and 
severity of the sanction imposed is based on  
 the type of participant (for example,  lender, builder, ma nagement broker, 
etc.), and 
 the nature of the actions  (for example., fraud, signif icant deficiencies in 
performance, ongoing disregard for VA requirements, and so on). 
 
Sanctions may be imposed in the form of  
 civil money penalties, and/or 
 the participant’s full or partial exclusion from participation in the VA loan  
guaranty program for a certain period of time. 
 
Appeal Rights VA provides appeal rights to all progra m participants agai nst whom sanctions 
are imposed.  The notice informing the pa rticipant that sanctions will be or 
are imposed explains what the particip ant must do to appeal VA’s decision.

  17-5  17.01  Program Participants, Continued 
 
Lender Check 
On Excluded 
Parties Lenders and other parties may want to  check whether a program participant 
has been excluded prior to  
 employing the program  participant, or 
 participating in a VA loan guaranty-related transaction, if  the program 
participant is also a pa rty to the transaction. 
 
Note :  This does not refer to a veteran usin g entitlement to obtain a VA loan. 
 
Reasons For 
Lender Check The following illustrates some of the r easons why a lender/other party would 
want to check on a participant’s exclusion.  
 A lender hiring an underwriter for its  VA lending activities may want to 
verify that the underwriter is not an excluded party.  
 A lender making a loan to a veteran fo r new construction is told by another 
lender that the builder has had pr oblems with some of its HUD/FHA 
transactions.  The lender may want to verify that the builder is not an 
excluded party. 
 A management broker establishing a pane l of contractors to do repairs to 
VA-owned properties must ensure th at none of the panel members are 
excluded parties.

Chapter 17:  VA Sanctions Against Program Participants VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  
17-6   17.02  False Lender Certification 
 
Lender 
Certification A lender must submit a signed certif ication with each loan submission 
indicating that in processing and und erwriting the loan, the lender has 
complied with  
 VA requirements 
 regulations, and 
 the law. 
 
The specific language required in the certification is found in Step 7 of 
“Lender Procedures ” in Section 4.01. 
 
False Lender 
Certification Any lender who knowingly and willfully makes a false certification may be 
subject to civil money penalties equal to the greater of  
 two times the amount of the Government’s loss on the loan involved, or 
 another appropriate amount, not to exceed $10,000. 
 
In addition to monetary penalties, VA  may impose other sanctions including, 
but not limited to  
 debarment and suspension, and 
 loss of automatic authority. 
 
Lenders 
Assessed Monetary Penalty  Lenders assessed civil money penalties for a false certification do not appear 
in GSA’s  List of Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement and 
Nonprocurement Programs .  Other program particip ants may still transact 
VA business with these lenders.  Exception :  Lenders may appear on the GS A list if another sanction is 
imposed against them in conjunction with  the civil money penalty.  In such 
cases, other program participants may be prohibited from transacting business 
with them.

Participants Lenders with their automatic authority  withdrawn do not appear in GSA’s  
List of Parties Excluded From Fe deral Procurement and Nonprocurement 
Programs .  Other program participants ma y still transact VA business with 
these lenders.  Exception :  Lenders may appear on the GS A list if another sanction is 
imposed against them.  In such cases , other program participants may be 
prohibited from transactin
g business with them. 
 
Withdrawal for 
an Indefinite 
Period Withdrawal for an indefin ite period can be based on 
 
 failure to continue mee ting basic qualifying criteria 
 for supervised lenders this  includes loss of status as  an entity subject to 
examination and supervision by a Fe deral or state regulatory agency 
 for nonsupervised lenders this includ es no approved underwriter, failure 
to maintain $50,000 working capital, and/ or failure to file the required 
financial statements

  17-9  17.03  Withdrawal of Automatic Authority, Continued 
 
Withdrawal 
Period:  180 
Days A withdrawal period of 180 days can be based on any of the following 
situations:  
 Loans conflict with VA credit standard s and would not have been made by 
a lender acting prudently. 
 Failure to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information which 
affects the veteran’s ability to repa y the loan, and which results in undue 
risk to the Government. 
 Employment or deposit veri fications are handcarried  by the applicant or 
otherwise mishandled, resulting in su bmission of significant misinformation 
to VA. 
 Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA 
requirements to veterans  to the detriment of their interests. 
 
Example  
The veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on the 
lender's incorrect advice that su ch options were excluded by VA 
requirements.  
 Closing documents show instances of improper charges to veteran after the 
impropriety of such char ges are called to lender’s attention by VA, or the 
lender refuses to refund such ch arges after notification by VA. 
 Deliberate delays in sc heduling loan closings.

Withdrawal 
Period:  1-3 
Years A withdrawal period of 1- 3 years can be based on any of the situations 
described in the table below. 
 
Situation Example 
Failure to properly disburse loan s Loan disbursement checks are 
returned due to insufficient funds. 
Involvement by the lender in the improper use of a veteran's entitlement Knowingly permitting the veteran to 
violate occupancy requirements, or lender involvement in the veteran’s sale of entitlement to a third part
y. 
 Lender makes the loan with the 
knowledge that the veteran is not purchasing the property to be his or her home.  Instead, the veteran intends to transfer title to a third party who assumes the loan shortly after closin
g.

  17-11  17.04  Withdrawal of LAPP Authority 
  
LAPP is a 
Privilege The authority to determine value under  LAPP is a privilege delegated to 
lenders at VA’s discretion.  Lenders ma intain this privilege by complying 
with all applicable LAPP-related VA requirements.  
  
Withdrawal or 
Amendment for 
Proper Cause VA can amend or withdraw the specia l privilege of LAPP authority from a 
lender for proper cause.  This applies to both supervised and nonsupervised 
lenders with automatic authorit y that have been granted LAPP authorit y. 
   
Withdrawal 
Time Period LAPP authority can be withdrawn for a sp ecific or indefinite period of time.

17-12   17.04  Withdrawal of LAPP Authority, Continued 
 
Examples of 
Withdrawal for 
Proper Cause The following is a non-inclusive list of  examples of proper cause that can 
form a basis for withdrawal of LAPP authority.  Technical incompetence  
Conduct demonstrating insu fficient knowledge of i ndustry-accepted appraisal 
principles, techniques and practices and/ or the inability to adequately apply 
them in reviewing appraisal reports and making value determinations for VA 
purposes.  Substantive or repetitive errors  
A substantive error is one which significantly involves the value determination or c ondition of the property.  In the aggregate, nonsubstantive 
errors which are frequently repeated may also indicate that LAPP case reviews are being performed in a careless or negligent manner.  
 
Disregard for VA requirements  
Continued disregard for the VA requirements and procedures outlined in VA regulations, guidelines, inst ructions or applicable la ws, after the problem has 
been brought to the le nder's attention. 
 Failure to meet qualification requirements  
The lender or the lender’s staff apprai sal reviewer (SAR) no longer meets the 
basic LAPP qualification requirements (see Chapter 15).  Civil judgments and convictions

  17-13  17.04  Withdrawal of LAPP Authority, Continued 
 
Notice of 
Sanction Generally, VA will provide written notice at least 30 days prior to imposition 
of the sanction to  
 the lender’s staff appr aisal reviewer (SAR) 
 the lending officer responsible for the quality of the SAR’s work, and 
 any other appropria te official(s). 
 
Note :  VA’s notice provides the basis fo r the sanction a nd information on 
how to exercise appeal ri ghts. 
 
Government at 
Immediate Risk VA is not required to give 30 days’ noti ce if the Government’s interests are 
exposed to immediate risk from the le nder’s activities.  The withdrawal is 
effective immediatel y in such cases. 
 
Determining 
Reasonable 
Value and Issuing CRVs Once LAPP authority is withdrawn, VA must 
 
 make all determinations of reas onable value for the lender, and 
 issue the Certificates of  Reasonable Value (CRVs). 
 
Note :  For any withdrawal longer than 90 days, the lender must reapply to VA 
to participate in LAPP. 
 
Imposition of 
Probationary 
Period As an alternative, VA may impose a probationary period for a specified 
period to further evaluate LAPP-related performance.  During that period, the 
VA office, at its discretion, may require  
 VA review of appraisal reports  and lender notices of value 
 VA staff issuance of the lender’s VA value notices 
 increased VA quality control review of the lender's LAPP cases, or 
 other measures designed to m onitor and improve performance.

Other 
Sanctions Withdrawal or amendment of a lende r’s LAPP authority does not preclude 
VA from  
 also withdrawing automatic processing authority, or 
 taking debarment or suspension actio n against the lender for the same 
cause. 
 
Relationship 
With Other 
Program Participants Lenders with their LAPP authority w ithdrawn do not appear in GSA’s List of 
Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement 
Programs.  Other program participants may still tr ansact VA business with these lenders. 
 Exception :  Lenders may appear on the GS A list if another sanction is 
imposed against them.  In such cases , other program participants may be 
prohibited from transactin
g business with them. 
 
Responsbilities 
of Lender As long as LAPP authority is withdraw n, it is the lender’s responsibility to 
ensure that VA, and not the lender  
 makes all determinations of  reasonable value, and 
 issues CRVs on its loans.

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  Chapter 17:  VA Sanctions Against Program Participants  
  17-15  17.05  Debarment and Suspension 
 
Debarment Debarment is a sanction that in most cases excludes the program participant 
from any participation in the nonproc urement programs of any Federal 
agency, including VA’s loan guaranty program.  Note :  Occasionally debarment is used to exclude the participant from only 
certain t
ypes of transactions. 
 
Debarment 
Time Period Debarment is effective for a period a ppropriate to the seriousness of the 
cause.  Often a period of 3 years is deemed appropriate. 
 
Suspension Suspension has the same impact as deba rment, but is imposed on a temporary 
basis, pending the outcome of  
 investigative 
 legal, or 
 debarment proceedings. 
 
Note :  Suspension can be followed by debarment if the results of the 
proceedin gs warrant. 
 
Suspension 
Time Period Suspension generally does not exceed  18 months.  It is imposed for a 
temporary period pending  
 investigative 
 legal, or 
 debarment proceedings. 
 
Note :  An additional period of debarment may follow.

Continued 
 
Unfair 
Marketing 
Practices Unfair marketing practices include, but are not limited to 
 
 enforcement of unfair co ntractual provisions 
 requiring purchasers to execute so-ca lled “contracts” which legally bind the 
purchasers but do not bind the seller to deliver the property when completed to the purchasers 
 
Example :  limiting a seller’s liability to the refund of the earnest money 
deposit 
 
 advertising that a property or projec t is “VA guaranteed” or “VA approved” 
or “VA inspected” in such a way as to  lead veterans to believe that VA 
guarantees the construction and workmanship Note :  “VA financing available,” “Eligi ble for VA financing,” or similar 
advertising is acceptable. 
 
 delaying tactics on the part of the bu ilder to postpone completion of the 
property or the closing of the sale after completion in an effort to induce the 
veteran to agree to a modificati on of a firm contract such as 
 the substitution of inferior materials 
 the omission of appliances, or 
 an increase in price. 
 
 failure of the seller or agent of the seller of proposed or newly constructed 
property to place deposits or downp ayments received from veteran-
purchasers in a special trust account , as required by 38 U.S.C. 3706 
 failure to place downpayments or ea rnest money deposits in a trust fund 
or in escrow when required by law or by local practice on existing properties, or 
 failure or inability of the seller to re turn the deposit when and if required 
under the contract when it is not re quired or not customary for these 
deposits to be “isolated,” and 
[38 U.S.C. 3706 ] 
 
 failure of the seller of proposed or newl y constructed property to state in the 
sales agreement, when applicable, that the property was or will be 
constructed under FHA compliance insp ection procedures pursuant to 
section 203(i) or 221(d)(2) of the National Housing Act.

Chapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  
 
18-2 1. Purpose and Elig ibility Requirements 
 
a. Purpose of 
SAPP Servicers of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  guaranteed loans may be 
granted authority, under Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP), to 
review liquidation appraisals, and issu e the Notice of Value (NOV) without 
VA involvement.  The servicer exer cises its SAPP authority through an 
employee who is VA-approved as a SAPP Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR).  
Once a SAR has satisfied the SAPP training and initial case review 
requirements (see section 3 of this chap ter), their SAPP authority may be used 
for eligible properties (t hose secured by VA-guaranteed loans) in any location 
within the United States and its territories.  The purpose of SAPP is to reduce the time required for servicers of  VA loans to receive the NOV.  
 Important :  It is the SAR’s responsibility to  stay informed about any local 
VA processing requirements unique to  the VA jurisdiction in which a 
property is located. 
 
b. Servicer 
Eligibility 
Requirements To be granted SAPP authority, the servicer must have:  
 
 a VA servicer identification number (ID), 
 an association with a single le nder having a VA lender ID, and 
 an effective quality cont rol (QC) system that ensures the adequacy and 
quality of its SARs.  (See s ection 6 of this chapter.) 
 Note:   Under SAPP, a servicer may only have an associati on with a single 
lender. 
 
c. SAR 
Eligibility 
Requirements The servicer exercises its SAPP author ity through an employee who is a VA-
approved SAR.  A SAR must:  
 be a full-time salaried employ ee of the lender/servicer, and  
 have at least three years of work ex perience that qualifies him or her to 
competently perform administrative appraisal reviews.

Chapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  
18-3 1. Purpose and Elig ibility Requirements, Continued 
  
c. SAR 
Eligibility 
Requirements (continued)  The SAR’s work experience must indicate that he or she has: 
 
 general knowledge of the principles, methods, practices, and techniques of 
appraising and the ability to apply that knowledge, 
 the ability to review the work of others and recognize deviations from 
accepted appraisal principles and practices, 
 the ability to detect errors in computations, and 
 the ability to detect conclu sions that are not supported. 
 It is also desirable for the SAR to ha ve knowledge of general realty practices 
and principles related to real prope rty valuation, skill in collecting and 
assembling data, and the ability to prepare clear and concise reports.  
 Note :  Three years experience related to the Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) Direct Endorsement (DE) pr ogram satisfies the experience 
requirement, provide
d all other application re quirements are satisfied. 
 
d. SAR 
Conflicts of 
Interest There must be no conflict of interest between the SAR’s role and any other 
activities that he or she conducts.  Examples of ot her activities that would 
constitute a conflict of interest  include, but are not limited to: 
 
 the SAR being on the VA fee appraisal panel, or 
 the SAR being employed by or performi ng appraisal review  services for 
another lender/servicer.

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  
Chapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  
 
18-4 2. Applying for Authority 
  
a. Application 
and Fees The nominating senior officer of the se rvicer and the nominee must jointly 
complete the Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) application.  SAR applicants must attach a resume showing they possess the three years requisite experience outlined in section 1 of this chapter. 
 A $100 processin
g fee must accompan y the application packa ge.   
  
b. Notification 
of VA Decision Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) Central Office will review the 
application and send a letter of prelimin ary approval or rejection.  In some 
cases, VA will need to request additiona l information from both the nominee 
and the senior officer in orde r to make a determination. 
 Receipt of a letter of preliminary ap proval will authorize the nominee to 
schedule Servicer Appraisal Processin
g Program (SAPP) SAR trainin g.  
  
c. SAR ID 
Number VA will issue a permanent identification (ID) number for each SAR 
approved.  The SAR always retains the same ID number, even when 
employed by a different servicer.    When a SAR already has a Lender A ppraisal Processing Program (LAPP) 
SAR ID number, the number will al so be used as the SAPP SAR ID. 
 
d. SAR 
Employed By New Servicer If a SAR begins work for a new se rvicer, the SAR’s SAPP authority 
automatically ceases and does not transfer  to the new servicer.  To reinstate 
the SAR’s SAPP authority, the new servicer employer must promptly submit to VA:  
 a new SAPP application, and 
 a $100 processing fee. 
 
The servicer may request a waiver  for the training and case review 
requirements for that SAR by including:  
 the SAR’s VA-issued ID numbe r on the application, and  
 a statement that the SAR has processed SAPP cases within the last 
year.

18-5 3. Training and Initial Test Case Reviews  
  
a. Requirements Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SARs) w ith preliminary approval may not 
independently review liquidation appr aisal reports and issue liquidation 
Notice of Values (NOVs), without th e involvement of Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA), until they recei ve final approval.  To obtain final 
approval, the SAR must complete the following:  
 attend Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SA R training, and  
 successfully complete five initial test  cases to demonstrate comprehension 
of VA liquidation appraisal review requirements to VA’ s satisfaction. 
 VA Central Office staff will provide SAPP SAR training at the request of the 
servicer and VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) staff will conduct the initial 
test case reviews.   
 
b. Test Case 
Procedures Upon completion of SAR training, SARs  may begin submitting their test 
cases in The Appraisal System (TAS) for VA review.  Only one test case should be pending at any time; SARs should not submit an additional test case until the results of a previously submitted test case are known.  RLC 
staff will notify the SAR about the re sults of the review.  The RLC staff 
performing the review of test cases mu st complete the liquidation appraisal 
review and issue the NOV within five workdays from the date the case is 
submitted by the SAR.    The following table outlines the steps for processing SAPP SAR test cases.  
Please note that these are the same steps for processing any SAPP cases, except for the requirement of VA involvement.  
Step Description 
1 SAR accesses the VA E-Appraisal application in the Veterans 
Information Portal (VIP or Portal ) and retrieves a SAPP appraisal.  
(Only SAPP appraisals associat ed with the SAR’s company may 
be retrieved.) 
2 SAR reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal pr actices and techniques, and for 
compliance with applicable VA directives and general and 
liquidation appraisal requirements in chapter 11 . 
 
The SAR must resolve any concerns  with the appraiser. (Report 
any contact with the appraiser and the results in “Processing 
Notes” when issuin g the NOV.)

b. Test Case Procedures  (continued)  
  
Step Description 
3 SAR determines the as-is value of the property, which must be 
supported by the reviewed apprai sal report. (Make entries in 
“Processing Notes” to clarify or ju stify actions that are not self-
explanator y.) 
4 SAR accesses TAS in VIP, selects “Issue Liquidation NOV,” and 
inputs the required data to genera te an NOV.  (TAS will not allow 
SARs with preliminary approval to issue NOVs; they may only be 
saved as NOV test cases awaiti ng review by the RLC.  (Upon 
receipt of SAR final approval, TAS will allow issuance of the NOV without VA involvement.)  Note:  The SAR must notify the RLC of jurisdiction when a test 
case has been submitted in TAS. 
5 VA RLC staff will review the fo llowing for all te st cases and a 
percentage of subsequent cases:  
 
 appraisal report, 
 any related documents, 
 the saved test case NOV, and  
 processing notes, for any contacts with the appraiser, processing 
delays and clarification and/or ju stification of processing actions.  
6 VA staff will issue the NOV.  The SAR will be notified of the 
result(s) of the VA test case review and the SAR’s performance file will be documented. 
 
c. Continuing 
Education by VA As needed, VA will notify SAPP SARs of supplemental training 
opportunities or additional training requirements.

18-7 4. Servicer Responsibilities 
  
a. SAPP 
Privilege Servicer Appraisal Processing Progra m (SAPP) authority is a privilege 
delegated to servicers at VA’s discretion.  Servicers maintain this privilege by 
complying with all applicable SA PP-related requirements, including: 
 
 Department of Veterans Affair s (VA) policies and procedures, 
 VA regulations, and 
 statutory requirements. 
 
Furthermore, servicers are expected to exercise due diligence in processing 
SAPP cases.  VA considers due diligence to be care that is properly expected 
from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reas onable and prudent servicer that is 
entirely dependent on the subject prop erty as a security to protect its 
investment.   If VA finds proper cause, the privilege extended to servicers under SAPP may 
be:  
 amended, 
 suspended, or 
 withdrawn. 
 
Reference:   For more information, refer to chapter 17 . 
 
b. Servicer and 
SAR Changes The servicer must notif y VA Central Office if: 
 
 there is a change in owners hip, merger, or acquisition, or 
 a SAR is no longer employed or is no longer functioning as a SAR for the 
servicer.  (In such cases, the SAR’s SAPP authority automatically ceases 
and the servicer’s eligibil ity to participate in SAPP is terminated if that 
individual was the servicer’s onl y SAR on staff.)

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  
Chapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  
 
18-8 5. Processing Procedures 
 
a. Property 
Eligibility The subject property must be secured by a Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) guaranteed loan that is proceedin g toward liquidation. 
 
b. Appraisal 
Request Servicers will request the appraisal in The Appraisal System (TAS) by 
completing VA Form 26-1805 , VA Request for Determination of Reasonable 
Value.  TAS will automatically notify the assigned appraiser via e-mail when 
the liquidation appraisal assignment is made.   
 Servicers may authorize parties to orde r appraisals on their behalf (i.e., law 
firms).  Those parties must register in  the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) 
under their own name as an “Other Requestor.” 
 
Note:   When making the request, be sure  to provide accurate information on 
the location of the keys to a vacant property in item 24 of VA Form 26-1805 , 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonabl e Value, as well as the telephone 
number of the party requesting the liquida tion appraisal in it em 40.  This may 
require additional instructions from servicers when referring cases to 
foreclosing attorneys, if the attorneys are the parties orde ring the liquidation 
appraisals.   If the agent… Then… 
is acting on behalf of an approved 
Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) servicer and is authorized b
y that servicer, he or she may request VA SAPP 
appraisals. 
requests an appraisal, he or she must use his or her own 
log-in identification (ID) to request appraisals.  An a ppraisal cannot be 
requested unless the sponsoring servicer is known at the time of the request.  Note:  In requesting an appraisal, the 
authorized agent is making the required certifications on behalf of the sponsorin
g servicer. 
receives notification the completed liquidation appraisal report has been uploaded in E-Appraisal, he or she must notify the sponsoring 
servicer or their Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) that the  appraisal was uploaded in E-Appraisal.

18-9 5. Processing Procedures, Continued  
 
c. Access to 
Property by 
Appraiser VA requires fee appraisers to gain access to vacant properties when 
performing VA liquidation appraisals in or der to determine accurate values.  
If the fee appraiser is unable to gain  access to a vacant property, the appraiser 
should use the contact inform ation provided in item 40 of VA Form 26-1805 , 
VA Request for Determination of Reas onable Value.  Servicers’ timely 
responses to any telephone inquiries he lp to limit delays  in completion of 
appraisals for those cases where an appraiser encounters problems accessing the vacant property.  If the appraiser still cannot gain access,  he or she must document the actions 
taken to obtain access to the subject vacant property in an e-mail to the 
Construction & Valuation (C&V) section of jurisdiction.  C&V will then forward the appraiser’s email to the Regional Loan Center’s Loan 
Administration Officer, who will forw ard it to the appropriate servicer 
personnel.   
 Time delays caused by an appraiser’s inability to access a property can result in postponed liquidation sales.  Because such delays are beyond the control of 
the appraiser, C&V “stops the cl ock” on the appraiser’s timeliness 
requirements until access is obtained.  However, in most cases, VA does not view delays as beyond the c ontrol of the servicer, a nd therefore the servicer 
may suffer curtailment of interest on th e loan if a sale cannot be completed 
timel
y due to dela ys in the appraiser obtainin g access to a propert y. 
 
d. Liquidation 
Appraisal Requirements For details about VA liquidation apprai sal requirements, see section 13 of 
chapter 11 . 
 
e. Submitting 
Cases to VA for Processing If a SAR is reluctant to issue the Noti ce of Value (NOV) due to the difficulty 
or complexity of the case, the SAR may request that the VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of 
jurisdiction issue the NOV.

Chapter 18:  Servicer Appr aisal Processing Program (SAPP)  
 
18-10 6. Servicer Quality Control System Requirements 
  
a. Introduction To qualify for Servicer Appraisal Pro cessing Program (SAPP) authority, the 
servicer must have an effective quality  control (QC) system that ensures the 
adequacy and quality of its staff appraisa l reviews.  This QC system must be 
independent of the servicer’s  loan servicing operation. 
 Upon request, the servicer must agree to furnish Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) with findings and inform ation about the system.  The senior 
officer must certify on each Staff Apprai sal Reviewer (SAR) application that 
the QC s
ystem meets the requirements detailed in this section. 
  
b. QC 
Reviewers Reviews of the SAR’s work may be pe rformed by an independent party or 
independent internal audit di vision that reports directly to the servicer’s chief 
executive officer.  QC personnel should possess:  
 a basic familiarity with apprai sal theory and techniques, and 
 the ability to prescribe appropriate co rrective actions when  problems in the 
appraisal review process are identified. 
 
c. Frequency 
and Scope of 
Reviews Perform desk reviews of each SAR’s a ppraisal reviews on a monthly basis.  
The sample size should be no less than:  
 five percent of the SAR’s SA PP cases processed monthly, or 
 a minimum number of cases per mont h (for example, five cases). 
 There must be a procedure for expanding the scope of the reviews if a pattern 
of deficiencies is identified. 
 
d. QC Review 
Criteria QC reviews should consider: 
 
 the overall quality of the SA R’s appraisal review, and 
 the appropriateness of the reasonable value determination. 
  
e. Maintenance 
of VA Publications The QC system must provide assurance that all current VA regulations, 
directives, and other releases are mainta ined and immediately available to the 
QC personnel and SARs.

f. Management 
Notification 
and Corrective Action The QC system must provide for written notification of deficiencies cited as a 
result of audits on quarterly reviews to:   
 the servicer’s senior management, or 
 the chief executive officer. 
 The QC system must requir e senior management to: 
 
 promptly initiate and document actions to correct deficiencies, and 
 provide SARs with corrective instructions. 
  
g. Review of 
VA Fee Panel Appraisals In addition to reviews of the SAR’s work, random field reviews of VA fee 
panel appraisals should be performe d.  These reviews can be done by:  
 
 the SAR, or 
 an independent appraise r on a contract basis. 
 
Note :  Any substantive negative findings should be formally reported to the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) where th e appraiser is a member of the fee 
panel.
