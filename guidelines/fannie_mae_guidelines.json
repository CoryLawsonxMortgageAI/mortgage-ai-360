For example, paystubs, W-2s, and tax returns must meet the same requirements without regard to the underwriting method. The following information describes DU considerations for specific types of income. For additional information, seeB1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax ReturnsB1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, and Section B3–3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income.Note: Only actual employer information should be entered in the employment section of the loan application. For example, do not enter “retired” or “homemaker” as the borrower’s current employer."

DU will consider the borrower self-employed if the ownership share is 25% or more, or if the ownership share is not completed but the business owner/self-employed indicator is checked. If the ownership share is 25% or more, the income is entered in Monthly Income (or Loss) based on the lender’s calculation of net income (or loss) from self-employment. If the ownership share is less than 25%, the income is entered in Gross Monthly Income (base, bonus, overtime, etc.). Schedule K-1 income for these borrowers should be entered as Other in Gross Monthly Income.For DU loan casefiles where two years of the most recent signed personal and two years of the most recent signed business federal income tax returns are required, business tax returns do not have to be provided unless the business is a corporation, an S corporation, a limited liability company, or a partnership. Under certain conditions, the requirements for business tax returns may be waived.DU will issue a message permitting only one year of personal federal tax returns if the loan application indicates the borrower is self-employed with an ownership share of 25% or more, and the Start Date for all self-employed businesses is at least five years prior to the Casefile Create Date. If any of the borrower's self-employed businesses have a Start Date less than five years, DU will require two years of personal tax returns. DU will issue a separate message listing the requirements for business tax returns for all self-employed businesses, specifying that one- or two-years of tax returns are required based on the number of years the business has been in existence (determined by comparing the Start Date to the Casefile Create Date).Refer toB3-3.2-01, Underwriting Factors and Documentation for a Self-Employed BorrowerB3-3.2-01, Underwriting Factors and Documentation for a Self-Employed Borrowerfor additional information and requirements related to underwriting, documenting, and calculating self-employed income."

Entry of the income into DU depends on what was derived as the “lesser of” amount:When the borrower's temporary leave income is used, enter the income amount into DU using the other income type Temporary Leave.When the borrower's regular employment income is used, enter the income amount in DU using the applicable income type.If the borrower's temporary leave income is less than the regular employment income and the lender is able to “supplement” the temporary income with available liquid reserves (perB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of IncomeB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income), the following must be applied:The lender must enter the combined temporary leave income and supplemental income from reserves in DU using the other income type Temporary Leave. The combination of these two incomes may not exceed the borrower's regular monthly employment income.As DU is not able to determine that supplemental income is being used, nor is it able to determine the amount of reserves used to supplement the temporary income, the lender must manually reduce the amount of the borrower's total liquid assets by the amount of reserves used to supplement the temporary income (in order to avoid the reserves being used for both income and assets)."

This level of documentation may not be adequate for every borrower and every situation. The lender must determine whether additional documentation is warranted. If the lender is unable to determine the stability of the borrower’s income on the basis of the available documentation, the income must be removed and the loan resubmitted to DU.\nThe standards for employment documentation are the same for DU loan casefiles as they are for manually underwritten loans. For example, paystubs, W-2s, and tax returns must meet the same requirements without regard to the underwriting method. The following information describes DU considerations for specific types of income. For additional information, see\nB1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns\nB1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns\n, and Section B3–3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income.\nNote\n: Only actual employer information should be entered in the employment section of the loan application. For example, do not enter “retired” or “homemaker” as the borrower’s current employer.\nReduced Income Documentation Requirements for High LTV Refinance Loans\nDU offers a reduced level of income documentation for high LTV refinance loans. Refer to\nB5-7-02, High LTV Refinance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan\nB5-7-02, High LTV Refinance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan\n, for additional information.\nAlternative Documentation Requirements for Income Validated by the DU Validation Service\nWhen a component of the loan file is validated by the DU validation service, DU will issue a message indicating the required documentation. This documentation requirement may differ from those described below. See\nB3-2-02, DU Validation Service\nB3-2-02, DU Validation Service\n.\nBase Pay (Salary or Hourly) Income\nDU will require the following:\na completed\nRequest for Verification of Employment\n(Form 1005),\nthe borrower's recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent one-year period, or\nthe borrower's recent Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) for military income and entitlements.\nBonus and Overtime Income\nDU will require the following:\na completed Form 1005, or\nthe borrower's recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.\nCommission Income\nDU will require the following:\na completed Form 1005, or\nthe borrower’s recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.\nSecondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs)\nWhen the second job income is not from self-employment, DU will require the borrower's recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.\nSelf-Employment Income\nIf the borrower is the business owner or is self-employed, the business owner/self-employed indicator must be checked in the loan application along with the percentage of ownership. DU will consider the borrower self-employed if the ownership share is 25% or more, or if the ownership share is not completed but the business owner/self-employed indicator is checked. If the ownership share is 25% or more, the income is entered in Monthly Income (or Loss) based on the lender’s calculation of net income (or loss) from self-employment. If the ownership share is less than 25%, the income is entered in Gross Monthly Income (base, bonus, overtime, etc.). Schedule K-1 income for these borrowers should be entered as Other in Gross Monthly Income.\nFor DU loan casefiles where two years of the most recent signed personal and two years of the most recent signed business federal income tax returns are required, business tax returns do not have to be provided unless the business is a corporation, an S corporation, a limited liability company, or a partnership. Under certain conditions, the requirements for business tax returns may be waived.\nDU will issue a message permitting only one year of personal federal tax returns if the loan application indicates the borrower is self-employed with an ownership share of 25% or more, and the Start Date for all self-employed businesses is at least five years prior to the Casefile Create Date. If any of the borrower's self-employed businesses have a Start Date less than five years, DU will require two years of personal tax returns. DU will issue a separate message listing the requirements for business tax returns for all self-employed businesses, specifying that one- or two-years of tax returns are required based on the number of years the business has been in existence (determined by comparing the Start Date to the Casefile Create Date).\nRefer to\nB3-3.2-01, Underwriting Factors and Documentation for a Self-Employed Borrower\nB3-3.2-01, Underwriting Factors and Documentation for a Self-Employed Borrower\nfor additional information and requirements related to underwriting, documenting, and calculating self-employed income.\nVerbal Verification of Employment\nA verbal VOE is required for each employer. For requirements regarding verbal VOEs, see\nB3-3.1-07, Verbal Verification of Employment\nB3-3.1-07, Verbal Verification of Employment\n.\nOther Income\nOther income must be entered in the loan application. DU supports a number of other income types. Income types not available in DU must be entered as “Other” income.\nRefer to\nB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income\nB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income\n,\nB3-3.1-05, Secondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs) and Seasonal Income\nB3-3.1-05, Secondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs) and Seasonal Income\n, and\nB5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements\nB5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements\n, for information on eligibility and verification of other sources of income.\nTemporary Leave Income\nWhen income from temporary leave is being used to qualify for the mortgage loan, the lender must enter the appropriate qualifying income amount into DU based on the requirements provided in\nB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income\nB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income\n.\nIf the borrower\nwill\nreturn to work as of the first mortgage payment date, the lender can consider the borrower's regular employment income in qualifying and must enter the income into DU using the applicable income type.\nIf the borrower will\nnot\nreturn to work as of the first mortgage payment date, but is able to qualify using the lesser of the borrower's temporary leave income (if any) or regular employment income, that “lesser of” income amount must be entered into DU. Entry of the income into DU depends on what was derived as the “lesser of” amount:\nWhen the borrower's temporary leave income is used, enter the income amount into DU using the other income type Temporary Leave.\nWhen the borrower's regular employment income is used, enter the income amount in DU using the applicable income type.\nIf the borrower's temporary leave income is less than the regular employment income and the lender is able to “supplement” the temporary income with available liquid reserves (per\nB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income\nB3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income\n), the following must be applied:\nThe lender must enter the combined temporary leave income and supplemental income from reserves in DU using the other income type Temporary Leave. The combination of these two incomes may not exceed the borrower's regular monthly employment income.\nAs DU is not able to determine that supplemental income is being used, nor is it able to determine the amount of reserves used to supplement the temporary income, the lender must manually reduce the amount of the borrower's total liquid assets by the amount of reserves used to supplement the temporary income (in order to avoid the reserves being used for both income and assets).\nNontaxable Income\nDU does not provide any unique messaging identifying the use of adjusted gross income.\nSee\nB3-3.1-01, General Income Information\nB3-3.1-01, General Income Information\n, for guidance on how to calculate adjusted gross income for nontaxable income. This topic also defines the requirements that nontaxable income must meet to be considered for qualifying purposes in DU. If these requirements are not met, the borrower’s income must be adjusted downward.\nNote\n: Certain loan origination systems offer an automatic calculation of adjusted gross income when nontaxable income types are entered in the loan application.\nRecent Related Announcements\nThe table below provides references to recently issued Announcements that are related to this topic.\nAnnouncements\nIssue Date\nAnnouncement SEL-2023-09\nOctober 04, 2023\nAnnouncement SEL-2022-05\nJune 01, 2022\nAnnouncement SEL-2021-10\nNovember 03, 2021\nAnnouncement SEL-2021-08\nSeptember 01, 2021\nAnnouncement SEL-2020-07\nDecember 16, 2020\nAnnouncement SEL-2019-07\nAugust 07, 2019\nHave questions?\nGet answers to your policy and guide questions, straight from the source.\nGet Started\nWork with Fannie Mae\nCustomer Login\nPassword Reset\nNot a customer?
